[Join us on #steemSTEM] One of the goals of the SteemSTEM project is to promote learning. The best way to learn about a topic is often to teach it to others! Steem and Steemit provide us with the unique opportunity to get rewarded for such efforts, and the SteemSTEM initiative affords us the opportunity to further reward the best contributions! What Were The Potential Prizes? 1st Place - 100 Steem Power + 4.224 STEEM (reward from the value of the announcement post) 2nd Place - 50 Steem Power + 4.224 STEEM (reward from the value of the announcement post) 3rd Place - 25 Steem Power + 4.224 STEEM (reward from the value of the announcement post) The top three posts were re-steemed in addition to the bonus monetary prize. As an extra thank you to all of those who participated, we are awarding a 5 Steem Power bonus to all runner up submissions. We appreciate all of your hard work creating these posts and thank you for the diverse sample of topics. Reviewing How Judging and Ranking Was PerformedThree members of the SteemSTEM team, @anarchyhasnogods, @lemouth, and @justtryme90 were responsible for judging the posts. We assigned each submitted post a score based on 4 guidelines. Accuracy - 15 pts Comprehensibility - 15 pts Formatting - 5 pts Appropriate citations and references - 5 pts Accuracy We will check for the scientific accuracy of your post. Remember that spreading inaccurate and/or false information leads to confusion for your readers! Comprehensibility We will rate on how easy it is to read and understand the text. Garbled text or text that is too technical can be hard to understand. Good scientific writing makes even complex topics seem simple. Formatting We will rate the post on how good it looks. People notice the formatting before the text. Large solid blocks of text are difficult to read and concentrate on, no matter the comprehensibility of the text. We are not looking for advanced formatting techniques, just basic, solid formatting. Citations Just citing your sources isn’t always enough. Listing the sources below the block of text you used them in can make it easier to follow what you got from where. The goal of citing information is not just to give credits, it also serves as a way for your readers to learn more if they are interested. Remember science is a discipline focused on learning and discovery, we should all work to help others achieve that when they read what we write. The ResultsThe Top Three PostsFirst PlaceNASA Disasters Re-examined: Part II by @vir What we thought: This was a fantastic post. The writing was very clear and engaging. The information was presented in a very clear manner. The formatting was visually appealing and allowed for a great flow when reading the material. Finally the number, quality and style of cited materials throughout the text was all extremely well done, and could serve as a reference for others to follow in their own posts. Second PlaceWild rabbit: the Ecosystem Engineer by @rmach What we thought: This was very engaging post. The writing is very clear and the information factual and well supported. The images and incorporated videos really aided in the ease of digesting the information and truly complemented the text. The information is also very well cited, though not as easy to access due to a lack of direct links. Third PlaceHow Image Recognition Works - Part 1: Basics and Perceptrons by @sykochica What we thought: This was a very interesting post! As with the top two submissions the writing in this post is exceptional and the information factual and well supported. The images and gifs really helped in understanding the process behind image recognition.

To sum up a long story, the steemSTEM project is a community-supported project aiming to increase the quality and the visibility of STEM (STEM is the acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) articles on Steemit. The Monthly Status ReportThe steemSTEM crew has continued to promote quality STEM content posted on Steemit with upvotes, comments and resteems via the @steemstem account. Moreover, an extra bonus reward in Steem Power has been provided directly to all of the the creators of well written, informative and correctly referenced STEM articles chosen for promotion by this project. Do not therefore hesitate to follow the @steemstem account for being kept up-to-date of good STEM Steemit articles! We try to guarantee at least 5 good posts a week! We show below the list of posts that we have resteemed and granted a 10SP reward to their author during the last 28 days. Through those rewards we have directly redistributed a total of 240 SP to the community (Also note that no members of the steemSTEM team have received compensation from this project, helping the community grow is it’s own reward). The list also illustrates the diversity of topics that have attracted the team’s attention. We strive with this to promote all types of authors unknown and well known, big and small. Additionally no topic is off limits for promotion so long as it is STEM related! It has been a real pleasure to encourage following those authors who work so hard to create great STEM content on Steemit.

The ResultsThe Top Five PostsFirst PlaceUltrasonography by @hagbardceline What we thought: Wow! What a well crafted post! Excellently written, organized, and cited. The formatting made the well crafted text even more easily digestible and the images chosen truly complemented the text. Finally, the depth and quality of the cited material should serve as a fantastic example of what one can do to both ensure an accurate post, as well as provide a nice springboard for further reading. We all learned quite a bit about ultrasound and its use in the ultrasonography technique from this post! Second PlaceDoes inhaling bacteria increase intelligence? by @jaki01 What we thought: Another fantastically crafted post! The writing is very clear and the information well supported. The information is also extremely well cited, and easy to access due to the author’s use of links and citation markers throughout the text. A fascinating report on Mycobacterium vaccae, and its influence on our brains, moods, serotonin levels and learning abilities. Third PlaceVirtual Futures : The Allure and Illusion of Digital Urbanism by @voronoi What we thought: This was a very thought provoking post! As with the top two submissions the writing in this post is exceptional and the information factual, well supported and interesting to read. The images and gifs of what the future augmented reality may look like really helped in making the text come to life and truly made for a wonderful learning experience. Fourth PlaceIn the future, Science may help patients forget certain memories by @mgibson What we thought: This was a very well written and interesting post. As with the top three submissions the writing in this post is exceptional, and the information factual. Though not as extensively sourced and shorter than the posts above, this is still a very well organized and thought provoking contribution to scientific discussion on steemit! Fifth PlaceSmallpox, Vaccination, and Oscillatory Epidemic Dynamics by @kzollove What we thought: Yet another great post. As with the top four submissions this is a well written piece of work and the information supported with citations. Tells a nice history of the eradication of smallpox as a result of of the development of the vaccine. We did look at your graph @kzollove, and we hope others will too!

At this place very far from us the male dragon “Tyrodocus” and his female partner “Ankylotops” are expecting a baby dragon. The attributes of the future descendant depend on the alleles (variants of genes) of its parents, and we have: dominant allele dominant attribute recessive allele recessive attribute A is able to spit fire a can’t spit fire B has poison fangs b is nontoxic D has red eyes d has yellow eyes E has a green tongue e has a violet tongue The dragon parents wish so much to get a baby who can spit fire, has poison fangs, yellow eyes and a violet tongue. Unfortunately the probability for that is rather low only. Given as help: Genotype of “Ankylotops”: AABbDdee. Genotype of “Tyrodocus”: aabbDdEe. Genes are inherited independently from each other (they aren’t coupled). Question: What is the exact probability that the dragon baby will have all desired attributes (can spit fire, has poison fangs, yellow eyes and a violet tongue)? Calculations/explanations are required.

Yep, physics is included in STEM too (even if there is no ‘P’ in STEM)! The rules are very simple: - A complicated problem will be asked. - The problem will be well defined, but not many details will be given. - A solution will have to be found by the community before the payout of the post. - The solution itself is worthless. The proof and the logic used to tackle the problem are what matters. - The challenge lasts 7 days. So far, nothing crazy. However we insist: the solution will have to be found by the community. This means that the community will share some rewards. In this way, anyone making a comment allowing the group to get closer to the solution will be rewarded. Yes, you read that correctly: anyone trying to help will be rewarded (and by rewarded we mean with money $$$). For this first challenge, the rewards consist of 100 STEEM as well as all SBD this post earns. The way this will be shared depends on the relevance of the comments that will be made, and this will be assessed by the steemSTEM crew: @lemouth, @justtryme90, @anarchyhasnogods, @jaki01, @hagbardceline. No member of the steemSTEM crew is eligible for these rewards, only any other participating member of the steemit community. Note that ALL rewards will always be paid to participants in the form of Steem Power. That is our usual way to contribute to the community. :) If after three days, the community is still in the dark, a first hint will be given (and the pot will be accordingly reduced). If after 5 days, the community is still lost, a second clue will be given (and the pot will be reduced a second time). Very importantly, there is no guarantee that the entire pot will be split among the participants. For instance, we can imagine a situation where the solution is not found, or where the comments are not helpful enough. In this case, a fraction of the money will be shared, and the rest will be used for the subsequent challenge. NOW THE CHALLENGE [image credits: Pixabay] Check the image above. How many balloons do we need to make this happen? From the discussion in the comments, please find below some further specifications: - We just want to lift the house out of the ground by few centimeters. We do not assume it is fixed. - We consider a real house and real balloons, so that the picture is only illustrative. - We make the crude and wrong assumption that all balloons can be inflated simultaneously in no time. Have fun! And remember: we don’t care about the exact solution. Only the deduction and logic that you all use matters!

The idea was to provide a problem where the answer was not unique, but that would instead allow Steemians to try to use what they knew about physics and show how their knowledge could be applied. We decided to focus on what is happening in the movie ‘Up’ where the old man attaches balloons to his house to go far in the sky. The question was about the number of balloons that was needed. Funnily enough, we even got answers that none of us were expecting! Our personal conclusions are that this challenge was a great success. It generated a scientific discussion that was spread over 35 comments. And it was really fun to discuss with you guys! Thanks a lot! As a consequence, we will propose another challenge… soon (enough). And now, what everybody is waiting: the results. First of all, the reward of 100 STEEM will entirely be shared among the participants. We were super happy with your participation! On top of that, the post earned 42.194 SBD, which once converted in STEEM, gives 30 STEEM. We will thus give back to the steemit community today a total of 130 STEEM. The total list of (alphabetically ordered) participants includes: @ace108, @bsameep, @cryptastic, @dreamrafa, @jamhuery, @lovewild, @Kryptik, @point . Each of the participants will get 3 STEEM to start with. This leaves 106 STEEM to be shared. It was very hard for us to decide, and those negotiations were actually tougher than the Paris agreement on climate change. Okay maybe not… This being said, the final ranking is @ace108: 3 STEEM @bsameep: 23 STEEM @cryptastic: 30 STEEM @dreamrafa: 6 STEEM @jamhuery: 20 STEEM @lovewild: 11 STEEM @Kryptik: 7 STEEM @point: 30 STEEM These accounts are currently being powered up, and thanks again for your participation.

(Hint: it is a redox reaction.) Let’s assume that gasoline consists to 100 % of isooctane C8H18, and a car would consume exactly 5 liters gasoline when it goes over a distance of 100 kilometers. One liter of gasoline would cost 1.50 euro. How many kilometers could the car go if the driver tanks up his vehicle for exactly 45.60 euro (tank was empty before)? How many kg and liters of CO2 would be emitted by the car while going the distance you calculated in part 2? Given parameters: ρ(C8H18) ≈ 0.75 g∙cm-3 ; molar masses: C = 12 g/mol ; H = 1 g/mol ; O = 16 g/mol ; universal gas constant R = 8.314 kPa∙l∙mol-1∙K-1; temperature T = 295 K (kelvin); air pressure p ≈ 1 bar ; 1 bar = 105 Pa Hint: use the equation of part 1! Let’s assume, the average speed of the car while going the distance which you calculated in part 2 was 100 kilometers per hour (100 km/h).

What is SteemSTEM?The steemSTEM project is a community-supported initiative to increase both the quality as well as visibility of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) posts on Steemit. We think that the STEM disciplines are not just niche topics for discussion, but core subjects essential to the long term growth and development of Steemit as an internet social media hub. We believe that the development of a thriving STEM community will serve to both retain the current demographic as well as bring in new users through the presentation of both interesting and cutting edge material. The project seeks in part to achieve these goal through the direct promotion of quality content posted on Steemit. The assessment of the quality of the content is achieved by a team of curators with expertise in various STEM disciplines who donate their time for the betterment of Steemit and the community. Project PhilosophyThe long-term goal of the steemSTEM project is to spread knowledge of STEM subjects and to increase the quality of the STEM posts. We (@steemstem) are doing this through positive reinforcement, by re-steeming, and upvoting good posts in the STEM field of expertise. The STEEM power used for this task is currently gathered in a twofold way, either via a direct delegation to the @steemstem account and or via the trailing of the @steemstem account by a bunch of followers. Do not hesitate to contact us if you want to participate (see the end of the post for direct links). In addition, we also host and support competitions of various types to encourage people to give their all, showing that with better effort the outcome can only be better rewards. The SteemSTEM Project is Committed to Distributing STEEM PowerSince its inception the steemSTEM initiative has been upvoting all accurate, comprehensive and correctly referenced articles. Occasionally, a high quality post was selected for re-steeming and the author was provided a reward of 5 SP, 10 SP or 20 SP (the exact amount has varied over time). The focus of this re-steeming is primarily for newer authors in need of additional exposure. Moreover, since the inception of the steemSTEM project, various other contests and projects have been organized and supported, and the community members rewarded with STEEM Power for their participation. These efforts have allowed us to give directly back to the Steemit community a total amount of 1838.5 SP, spread over 99 different Steemians! Supported ContestsThe steemSTEM project has been heavily involved in supporting contests designed to challenge the Steemit community, instill a greater appreciation for STEM content and increase the vested (STEEM Power) stake of the STEM community members (both content creators and commenters alike). We have supported contests (either through helping with exposure, providing funding or both) run by a variety of STEM content creators including: @jaki01 biologychallenge 1 chemistrychallenge 3 chemistrychallenge 4 chemistrychallenge 5 @kenchung Get Ready!

We feel that these contests were a huge success and resulted in the generation of a nice set of high quality content. One physics challenge has also been organized by @lemouth SteemSTEM physics challenge 1 - Up! Results for the Physics challenge 1 - Up!! Current and Future Project ActivitiesIn continuing with the tradition of steemSTEM management team run contests and competitions, we are currently running a Steemit Science Fair! This project is being spearheaded by @biuiam who is putting in a large amount of effort to ensure a quality competition! Steemit Science fair. Growth of the steemSTEM Management TeamAs the community grows so too does the team of users dedicating their time to support the workings of the project. The steemSTEM management team currently includes (in alphabetical order) @anarchyhasnogods, @biuiam, @cristi, @justtryme90, @lemouth, @mobbs (newest managing team member assisting us in expanding curation efforts to better cover the technology tag), and @suesa. Each of these management team members has delegated at minimum 10% of their personal STEEM Power to enable the @steemstem account to accrue STEEM through curation which is provided back to the community in the form of the above rewards. The steemSTEM management team members do not receive ANY STEEM generated by the project account as payment for their participation and dedication to the project. All generated funds are returned to the community. Moreover, many additional Steemians have generously agreed to trailing the steemSTEM project account’s (@steemstem) votes. In this way, good STEM content on the platform gets better rewarded, through the active curation efforts of the steemSTEM management team members. In addition, many of the voted posts are advertised on our discussion channel on Steemit.chat, so that Steemit STEM-aficionados can find, read and comment those posts in an easier way. The science-fair and growing the steemSTEM curation trail are our two big projects of the moment, which are connected to the growth of the initiative. In the case you want to help (there is no help too small!), you can either join us on the Steemit.chat, on the steemSTEM channel, and/or follow our curation trail on Streemian. The @steemstem Voting/Curation BotAn “in-house” @steemstem curation bot is currently being worked on, implemented and maintained by @anarchyhasnogods as a means to complement the streemian service and ensure consistent support of STEM content by the steemSTEM team and community. More information about this bot and how to signup may be made public in the coming weeks. Thank You Steemit CommunityFinally we would like to thank each and every member of the Steemit community, for their open minds, and quest for knowledge and understanding. We will continue to tirelessly work to the best of our abilities to develop a vibrant STEM community on Steemit such that we may all be educated, entertained and amazed by the great work happening around the world to increase our understanding of ourselves, our planet and our universe. We appreciate the generous support by the community members for this project, and look forward to continuing to work with all current and future supporters to achieve the lofty (but attainable!) goals of the project.

You read an article on a science blog or magazine, watch a documentary on youtube or the discovery channel, you even come across a video on facebook and you get the inspiration to write your next steemit post under the #science tag, but does your post deserve it? Science is a field driven by the application of the scientific method; one where no information gets accepted without confirmation through observation and data collection. Science is respected and considered an authority, specifically because of its adherence to the ideals of answering hypotheses (questions) with data, one where theories are built by repeated confirmation of these hypotheses, and one where only more data can overturn a theory and replace it with another. Science is a field where new experiments are built on top of the results of those that came before, and one where crediting those giants upon whose shoulders we all stand is an absolute must. Blogging about science however, is not the same as performing science, but not all science-posts are really that…scientific. This is a truth we all understand, because science can mean different things to different people. Nevertheless, the underlying unifying ideas all come back to the very same Science which we described above. Blogging about science does not need be held to the same level of scrutiny as an actual scientific publication. However, we should still strive to do ‘Science’ justice, and by using the #steemstem tag and following a few simple guidelines, we each can achieve this with out too much difficulty! In short, a #steemstem post should: Follow a logical course, supported by arguments. Have proper syntax, grammar and spelling (poor language use often destroys the clarity a post describing a scientific concept should have). Be well-written in a clear way, no obscurities, misunderstandings or misinterpretations. Be well-formatted. Be well-researched. Not spread false information. Cite your sources and credit* your images. *Images should be properly credited to their owners. It is advisable that you use images with no copyrights, such as PD (Public Domain - no copyrights) or CC0 (Creative Commons licensed - the creator has set zero terms on their use). In case you want to use a copyright-protected image, you should ask for the creator’s consent. Fair use of copyrighted images is allowed in cases of educational content, research, personal use or any other use that is beneficial to the public. The steemSTEM (@steemstem) community is here to support STEM-related posts, where STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. If you wish your post to be noticed and curated by steemSTEM (@steemstem), then seriously consider the above. This will help us help you and shed light to posts left undervalued and unnoticed.

Our team scours the platform for original and quality content.After working through thousands (literally!) of STEM-related posts and upvoting more than 200 that we deemed to be worthy, we proudly present you our top 7 handpicked choices: ## Monday - WCG: Fight AIDS at home - Analysis of HIV wild-type and mutant structures via in silico docking against diverse ligand libraries. The World Community Grid is a project that enables anyone with a computer, smartphone or tablet to donate their unused computing power to advance cutting-edge scientific research. In this post, @donkeykong9000, gives us an overview of how the project has helped in the fight against AIDS. Tuesday - The Body Clock – a brief Introduction to the Circadian Rhythm The Circadian Rhythm is essentially an internal clock we all carry inside us and it controls way more aspects of our biology than you can probably guess! Wednesday - My first “shrink” pick: Alfred Alder. What came after the analyst couch @erh.germany is a newcomer in #steemstem and in her latest post she gives us some insight on Alfred Adler (1870-1937), world renowned philosopher and psychiatrist, and why his work was so important in the field of psychiatry. Thursday - #10 IQ overload: Paul Dirac A post on another great quantum mechanics scientist from @jakipatryk’s series, Paul Dirac. Friday - How To Make Coding Easier For Computer-Related Students? An interesting and useful post by programmer @ruelrevales on how to make coding appeal more to students. Saturday - The Physics Of Dandelion Dispersal Could Inspire Windborne Micro Drones Read this fascinating post from @rickie to see how the studying of dandeliion spores’ flight could find application in micro-flight science. Sunday - Vaccination: The Dangerous Myth that will Kill, Part 5 of 5 Vaccination and purpoted links to autism, quite the hot button topic on the interwebs these days. Here @kryzsec discusses his take on some of the research surrounding these claims. A few words about the nomination process For the sake of transparency we feel we need to clarify how our nomination process works; each issue is compiled by certain members of the SteemSTEM community. This week’s editorial team was comprised of @ruth-girl, @trumpman, and @justtryme90. The editorial team chooses their favorite posts for the week and each issue is the result of their joined effort. In order to keep the process fair, posts written by the editorial team are excluded from the nomination process. Don’t be discouraged if you didn’t make it on this issue. The competition is harsh and there is always a next time :) In the meantime, you may wish to check these guidelines for extra tips on how your writing can be more effective. Authors That Received a Curie Upvote by the SteemSTEM Team In the same spirit of being transparent about our actions that are now supported by @curie, we will release every week a list of authors who have caught the attention of the @steemstem curation team. If you want to discuss this with us, please do not hesitate to join the steemSTEM channel on the Steemit chat or to follow our curation trail on Streemian. If you are not on Streemian, we have a plan B through a homemade voting bot. You can contact us on the chat in order to be added to its trail. From December 3 to December 10, we rewarded 98 different authors who have written a total of 157 different articles. The authors who received both a @steemstem and a @curie vote that week are: @aboutcoolscience, @afifa, @alexander.alexis, @alexbeyman, @alexs1320, @altherion, @amavi, @angelinaa, @anwarabdullah, @apsu, @azirgraff, @azissuloh, @barvon, @bigdizzle91, @biuiam, @boyasyie, @carloserp-2000, @cristi, @dber, @dkmathstats, @dojeda, @dysfunctional, @ememovic, @emilclaudell, @erh.germany, @eriq, @ertwro, @eurogee, @exercisinghealth, @frankjavier, @freddbrito, @fugetaboutit, @fulsketch, @gentleshaid, @gloglo, @green07, @greenrun, @guga34, @harshameghadri, @herpetologyguy, @holger-will, @holuwa-seun, @hugobohor, @illuminatus, @irime, @jedigeiss, @jefpatat, @jenara, @joseg, @katiuskagomez, @kedi, @kenadis, @kerriknox, @kharrazi, @kingswisdom, @kryzsec, @laylahsophia, @maria1989, @martinezkarla, @maticpecovnik, @mcfarhat, @mcw, @mike11, @mostly.nature, @mountain.phil28, @muftykutink, @muphy, @myego13, @natord, @nedspeaks, @ongoingwow, @pangoli, @pearlumie, @pisolutionsmru, @polaleye50, @pratik27, @proteus-h, @replichara, @rickie, @rifkan, @rt395, @samminator, @saunter, @sco, @simulate4life, @siniy, @soorefunmi, @st3llar, @stabilowl, @steemmillionaire, @taborda-charrouf, @tensor, @thatsweeneyguy, @tking77798, @valth, @wilians, @yoes, @zest All curation rewards earned will be used to fund @steemstem project functioning and activities.

We are going to address important aspects regarding the overall quality of a post that go beyond scientific writing technicalities, and we’ll also demonstrate how to engage in this community. As will be shown, this entails more than having some science-tagged-posts being curated by our crew. What Does it Involve, Then?Let’s start with a question. Why are you posting? If the answer is ‘money’ to you, then it is obvious to us, too. There is a distinct difference between posts of somebody struggling to come up with ideas to get rich and somebody who has been inspired to teach or engage in the community with original ideas. The most successful authors are those who are both driven by reward, and passionate and consistent with their work (more on this later). The level of commitment and pride you have for your blog content is essential. Your reputation and followers are the by-products of this and the upvotes always come next. Yeah, in short: the community comes first. The rest follows. So, just in case you got this order of events mixed up, please reassess it. Commitment and dedicationWhat do you blog about? Plants, animals, mental health? Whatever it is, take your time to do some research on your topic. This is after all how your readers will eventually follow you. This might take a while, but keep in mind you are not the only one in this situation - this always makes one feel better! The goal should be to create a document that you are proud of - which will likely take anyone quite a bit of time! But what is research, if not searching on Google? Try Google Scholar or other academic sources. Don’t be afraid to personally email researchers on the subject you’re interested in. They are almost always more than happy to engage with you, give you permission to use their images and offer even more than you asked. It could even be an opportunity to bring a new professional into the community. Dig DeeperOften when I write about something on the fringes of science, I find that a slight detail has been disputed in a paper saturated with evidence to the contrary. These aren’t things to ignore, embrace it and discuss it, even if it is your area of expertise. There’s nothing wrong with a subject being wrong or controversial, as long as you rationally discuss it and provide evidence whilst opening up discussion. Pressing the POST buttonNow, that you have finished writing your post, which might have taken you several hours or even days to put together, you are ready to press the POST button. Yeah! As soon as one presses the POST button, the obsession begins: ‘Will I be upvoted?’ ‘Why aren’t they upvoting me?’ I think ‘Mine is better than theirs, yet they got the big upvote?’ It’s tough. But, here is the good news: the steemSTEM team has a group of curators, scouring the platform searching for all the material related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics.They are real knowledgeable people, looking for quality content in order to reward them better. But it is a small team with limited voting power. 6 months ago it was easy to upvote every single post, 24/7, that deserved it with time to spare to scour the lesser-known corners of Steemit to find new potential. Now things have grown exponentially, this is impossible, yet each curator still reads and proof-reads twenty (or more) 500-2,000 word posts a day. But there are much more than 20 authors, and so a higher level of expectation is a must, and authors need to strive to be the best. So what are the minimum requirements that we look for?1) Originality : In case you are not sure of how to be original when writing a science post, it is simple: Write using your own words. This equivalently means making more of an effort than just giving a twist here and there to that article you saw in psychologytoday.com or on BBC Planet. 2) Well Written, Clear English: If your reader can’t clearly understand the points you are trying to make, then your post is not effective! 3) Well Formatted Posts: In short, make your content easy-to-read and follow for everyone. Add headings, find nice images (and reference their sources), and do not make your posts too long, or too short either! 4) Use A Language You Are Comfortable With: Curators are all seeing and all knowing. They even have magic tools! If you feel it’s too difficult to write in English, you may try to translate an article about global warming from a Spanish source and try to sell it as your own original work. This will most likely leads to flags and reports to steemcleaners, and your Steemit career could be over, just like that! Instead, we have a growing, trusted community of different nationalities, from Nigeria to Italy, France and Venezuela. If you persevere, these communities will allow you to grow in your first language. If your English is average but needs improvements, consider using tools such as Grammarly or even, you know, friends from the aforementioned communities. References. Please reference everything; all the sources of information for your post, as well as all the images. This is not that hard and will only bring you credibility. We all stand on the shoulders of giants, so give them a little credit. These are the minimum objective requirements, and you are capable of meeting them, don’t you think? We think so too. So please keep them in mind. However, the bigger we grow, the more selective we have to become, so how do you shine above the rest? Well, once you’ve mastered the minimum requirements, there are, of course, other things to consider: practicality, originality, personality, style and other subjective factors all lead to a more beautiful and worthwhile post. PracticalitySure, a 12-page report on the physical dimensions of spines on the leaves of Western Sarahan cacti or whatever is important in some academic circles, but what value has it to the steemstem community readers, and to a larger extent, Steemit itself? If the answer is ‘nothing’, perhaps you should reconsider the topic. OR if you still choose to proceed, temper your expectations for the amount of attention it will get. OriginalityWe already discussed using your own words to make original content, but instead of just finding a topic and re-writing it, perhaps try to find a new angle, find some of the latest research and discoveries. Don’t just put other content into your own words (but of course do ensure that you use your own words!), make the content itself your own! PersonalityYou could even include how the information you discuss has a personal impact in your life. This brings followers in because they get to know you and want to follow you, rather than the information you provide. Writing in your own style gives us curators more confidence that it really is you too, rather than some report copied from some obscure website, which then wastes more time as we work on finding the original source material. StyleDon’t be afraid to make the post fun or humourous. Don’t be scared to mix it up a bit with some creative spin, fictional characters debating for example, or using your other talents to make it shine, be it music, art, photography or whatever. The more unique it looks, the quicker and longer it catches everybody’s attention. In short, authors should ask themselves ‘is it valuable’ or ‘is it interesting to the casual reader’, or even more importantly, ‘is it understandable?’ Beyond the PostThere is more to this opportunity. As we said at the beginning, being a member of the Steemstem community is not only about writing a post and having it upvoted by the team. It is first and foremost about sharing STEM knowledge, educating and eradicating superstitious beliefs. There are many ways to become a member of the steemSTEM community besides posting quality material. You can for instance engage in healthy and adult debates, take part in friendly chats in the steemSTEM chat channel, or even motivate other members of the community through commenting on their posts. The attraction of Steemit, for many, is the financial reward. However, the posting/expecting to be paid for it pattern can be a frustrating one, particularly for newcomers. So, please try to look beyond this. This is a view that will only isolate you from the bigger picture that the steemSTEM community is: **a family of science lovers who support one another with mentoring, comments, jokes, upvotes, quick words on the chat, collaborative works and so forth. And, of course, why not … a community that sets an example to all the other ones within the Steemit platform.

But what can we exactly do with data. @edumurphy is letting us know. Tuesday - Becoming undead - How zombie cells make you older Zombies do exist, at least in biology. Cells known as senescent cells are a class of cells that do not divide, but that do not die as well. Zombie cells in short. More about that is detailed by @aboutcoolscience. Wednesday - Trehalose, a common food additive, may have fueled worldwide Clostridium difficile outbreaks Want to know about a special sugar, this post of @tking77798 is for you. The author details what trehalose is and how it could potentially facilitate outbreaks. Thursday - #11 IQ overload: Wolfgang Pauli All you wanted to know about the life of Wolfgang Pauli is detailed in this post of @jakipatryk who manage a series about known scientists of the last century. Friday - Journal of Unpublished Results – A case for the validity of scientific research (Part II) Check out what beautiful things @replichara does in his lab, experimenting with carcinogenic genes. Follow him step by step and watch him “disarm” those evil cells! Saturday - How are traits inherited across generations? From albinism, peas, to incest, this post by @hadji is quite the educational trip on genetics and inheritance. Just how are traits passed on to future generations anyhow? Well, take a dive into this post and you just might learn the answer. Sunday - Super Bugs - What is antibiotic resistance and how we are fighting it The discovery of antibiotics was one of immense importance, one which has allowed the human race to fluorish to new heights. However, bacteria were not going to go down with out a fight, and some have developed resistances to our chosen antibiotic compounds. Here @tfcoates breaks down what it means to be one of these ‘super bugs’ and what we intend to do to fight them back. A few words about the nomination process For the sake of transparency we feel we need to clarify how our nomination process works; each issue is compiled by certain members of the SteemSTEM community. This week’s editorial team was comprised of @justtryme90, @lemouth and @ruth-girl. The editorial team chooses their favorite posts for the week and each issue is the result of their joined effort. In order to keep the process fair, posts written by the editorial team are excluded from the nomination process. Don’t be discouraged if you didn’t make it on this issue. The competition is harsh and there is always a next time :) In the meantime, you may wish to check these guidelines for extra tips on how your writing can be more effective.

In addition, he explains us why food tastes weird after having brushed our teeth. Tuesday - The Holocene Mass Extinction Part 6: Taking Action The Holocene mass extinction means that the world is screwed. Many species are either at risk of extinction over the next century, or in a very bad shape. There is stuff that can be done, and @mountainwashere tells us about that. We should not give up hope… yet. Wednesday - Herd Immunity is a Lie, and here is Why! (it’s not a lie) Vaccines and herd immunity? One of the good old debate here on Steem. This article of @alexs1320 details varied statements on the topic and shows the numbers backing them up (or not). Thursday - Reaction in lab: The Swern oxidation With the sciencepic challenge, @mcw discusses the glory details of Swern oxidation and how it works (with plenty of pictures). From the article, you will learn the mystery behind a temperature of -78 Celsius, why it matters and how it interplays with Swern oxidation. Friday - Depression – Where to Draw the Line? Life is sometimes tough and one ends up being depressed. This is actually very common those days. In order to clarify the misconception behind this emotional disorder, @abigail-dantes wrote an interesting article in which she clearly state what depression is, distinguishing in particular its mild and severe form. Saturday - How are traits inherited across generations?The Paradox of Non-Transitive Dice and Our Imperfect Intuitions It’s not often that you hear the word…’statistics’ and think… “Ohh boy!” However leave it to @rocking-dave to change all that with just a toss of a few dice! Give this post a roll and you may find your self as fascinated by these rock/paper/scissors like dice as we were! Sunday - The construction loving Master Mind How weird are your thoughts? Are your memories of real events, or have you conveniently invented them to be much rosier then they should be? For how much of what you think about your self, have you actually checked that it’s true? How much of all that you are just a construction?

This (somewhat lengthy) post will inform you on the progress that we have made in the last few months, our current philosophy regarding supporting STEM content on Steemit, our desire to grow and nurture a community of STEM content creators, and some plans/ideas we have for the future of the project. What is SteemSTEM?The steemSTEM project is a community-oriented initiative to increase both the quality as well as the visibility of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) posts on Steemit. Discussion revolving around STEM disciplines are not just niche topics, but rather core subjects essential to the long term growth and development of Steemit. We believe that a thriving Steemit STEM community is crucial for providing support and encouraging further development of current skilful bloggers, as well as recruiting outside talent. Each is necessary for achieving our mission to provide Steemit with quality, interesting and cutting edge STEM content. The project seeks in part to accomplish these goals through the direct promotion of quality content posted on Steemit. Quality assessment of content is achieved by a team of curators with expertise in various STEM disciplines working on behalf of the community. Curation by @steemstem is further aided by a collaboration with @curie through its Community Support program. Curation ProgressSince the initiation of the collaboration with @curie 18 weeks ago, the SteemSTEM project curation team has supported over 3432 posts, of which 2480 posts received votes from both the @steemstem and @curie voting trails. This corresponds to 686 unique authors upvoted by @steemstem, and 544 unique authors upvoted both by @steemstem and @curie. Our Weekly Curation Digest: SteemSTEM Distilled Members of the curation team have also begun assembling a weekly curation digest (Issue: [#1], [#2], [#3], [#4], [#5], [#6], [#7], [#8], [#9],[#10],[#11],[#12],[#13],[#14],[#15],[#16],[#17]) highlighing one exceptional post from each day of the week as a means to provide further exposure for excellent content creators; as well as provide examples that other community members can learn from to improve their own blogging skills. What Are The Criterion Used by the SteemSTEM Curation Team When Voting on Posts?One question which community members frequently ask is “What do the curators look for when selecting content for votes?” As explained in detail in this post, four requirements are in order. An authors’ post must be original, well written (using clear English), well formatted (easy to read) and not plaggiarized (or translated from foreign sources). Moreover, being recognized by @steemSTEM means more that just being rewarded for his/her blog. It means that the author is engaged with our vibrant community through posts, participation on the chat (on the steemit chat or discord) and through comments on the articles of other STEM authors. Sub-communitiesThe steemSTEM team members understand that our standards require a high level English proficiency that not all members of our growing community may possess. We recognize that this is both unfair, and also is closing the door on a chance to educate and inform more people. To enable users to be able to create content that is keeping with the SteemSTEM qualilty guidelines, but written in their own native languages we have begun establishing sub communities with curators/managers who have both scientific expertise as well as any needed language expertise. Each community has chosen a unique tag for users to use to better enable identification of local or non-english STEM content of high quality. To date collaborations with the following communities have been established: | Community/Language | group tag | managers/curators | | ——– | ——– | ——– | | Nigerian | stemng | @greenrun | | | | @gentleshaid | | Italian | itastem/scienze | @aboutcoolscience | | French | franco-stem | @guga34 | | | | @kingswisdom | | Spanish | | @carloserp-2000 | | | | @iamphysical | We thank each of these sub-community managers for their efforts to expand the spread of quality STEM content on steemit. We look forward to assisting them in growing the size of these communities and bringing more great content creators to our platform. Additional Projects SupportedIn addition to the project’s curation function, we also encourage and support various community member initiatives through the donation of STEEM POWER as rewards for their participants. Since the previous update we have supported the following projects/contests: @kenchung Mathematics Programming Competition #5 Mathematics Programming Competition #6 Mathematics Programming Competition #7 Mathematics Programming Competition #8 @suesa Suesa’s Science Challenge #2 Suesa’s Science Challenge #3 - A Very Science Christmas @mystifact Mystifact-or-Fiction Challenge #1 Mystifact-or-Fiction Challenge #2 @biuiam SteemSTEM Science Fair @curiousity Curiousity Science Contest @mcw Christmas: Science Picture Challenge Potential/Likely Future ProjectsDisclaimer: All projects discussed below are tentative, and require future developments by either Steemit Inc. or other community developers as well as collaborations between the SteemSTEM team and other generous Steemit community members/developers. Implementation of a STEM Community SMTSteemit’s recent announcement of Smart Media Tokens and their intended use to aid in the development of internet communities provides us the opportunity to implement a secondary token revolving around the creation of STEM content. We have teamed up with @reggaemuffin who has offered to help us with the technical side of creating an SMT. Currently the finer details of how these tokens will function have not yet been completely revealed. It is nevertheless our intention to utilize this new technology to continue to build the STEM community on Steemit as soon as possible. The steemSTEM community is not just those of us in the SteemSTEM management and curation teams, but actually all of you as well. Implementing a SMT needs to be done in the right way: one which will help the community grow! This means that we will need your help in deciding what to do with these tokens. Please drop by our channels on the steemit chat and/or on discord, or leave a comment below if you have any suggestions about the way in which one should implement the token to encourage excellence in STEM content. This is a community project, and a SteemSTEM SMT would be a COMMUNITY token, one that we are all proud to distribute and use to promote STEM the world over. Also, if you have not checked out the SMT White Paper, you can also do that Here. Perhaps you will find some inspiration by reading through it! An Official SteemSTEM/STEM CommunityThe steemSTEM team, much like everyone on the platform, is extremely excited at the prospects of official communities being implemented on steemit. We have been trying our best to organically grow the group of posters who possess a likeminded vision that high quality, interesting, well cited and well formatted blog posts will illustrate to the masses that steemit THE place to go to read about Science and Tech. In recent months the community size has increased to almost 2100 followers of the @steemstem project account and over 600 members on steemit.chat. The current (and growing) size of the community will to enable us to rapidly transition to official community status as soon as the Steemit Inc developers deploy the platform update. The SteemSTEM Meetup At The Large Hadron Colider As many of you are aware we (well mostly @lemouth) have been planning and organizing the first ever SteemSTEM meetup. Not to be outdone by other communities @lemouth wanted to help us bring our A-Game and meet somewhere that many scientists only dream to go. The worlds largest particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, in located Geneva Switzerland at CERN. As the corner stone of this meetup the group of attendees will be going down into the LHC to see the Compact Muon Solenoid detector, where researchers use a massive solenoid magnet to generate a magnetic field 100,000 times the strength of our planet’s, to bend the beam of subatomic particles generated by the collisions. Pretty cool destination, and an amazing opportunity to promote both STEEM/Steemit and the SteemSTEM project! Don’t ya think? To date 18 people have been confirmed to participate, however for those unable to make the trip, worry not! We plan to take plenty of pictures and also do some video recording to bring the experience home for you all to share as well. This looks to be an amazing community building event! The Future Is Bright, Our Community Is VibrantFinally, we would like to take a moment in this closing section to thank our community members for the great discussions that we have in the group chat on steemit.chat (https://steemit.chat/channel/steemSTEM) and more recently on discord too, as well as for their enthusiasm for what we are trying to do; enthusiasm which can be seen in our winning the award for best public chat on steemit.chat, a testament to the supportive atmosphere that the community keeps and the enthusiasm they share for each others’ content and STEM as a whole. We strive to keep our steemit.chat and discord channels positive places where users who are creating STEM content can discuss whatever they want. It’s not just about chatting science, it’s our place to get to know one another, and to help build the relationships that will allow for a network that can support one another! Our community is about helping each other grow on steemit. Thank You All for your support of this project, for creating the wonderful content that you do, for your passion for the fascinating mysteries of the world, and for allowing us the privilege of building this community.

However our meetup will not just be about exploring CERN… We will also go underground, and see the Large Hadron Collider from a few meters away! A dream for many scientists from all over the world. This is an extremely unique opportunity, and it’s one that the members of the steemSTEM project/community get to experience ONLY because of doors opened up by STEEM/Steemit! Because of how unique this is, we feel it’s a really great opportunity to promote STEEM, the steemit platform, and of course our steemSTEM community! For more information on the steemSTEM project, the best place to check is our winter update. The steemSTEM team will be documenting the tour, with the hope that future Steemit promotional materials will be constructed out of the images and video that is shot as the community members tour this world class research facility. How is all of this possible? Well, we (@steemstem) have the right connections… A group of 20 Steemians will meet at CERN, on February 8th - 9th, to have fun, chat about science and technology (we are steemSTEM after all) and visit the place. In particular, they will be allowed to go down inside the Large Hadron Collider (the LHC) and visit the CMS detector. CMS is a huge magnet that allows detection of what is going on in the very highly-energetic collisions that are happening at the LHC. Some more practical details now.WhoOur 20 participants are, alphabetically ordered: @alexs1320, @ana.luiza, @aurel.proorocu, @bendelgreco, @ceybiicien, @dber, @ertwro, @fredrikaa, @grandpere, @howo, @justtryme90 (+1 guest), @kerriknox (+1 guest), @lemouth, @reggaemuffin, @saunter, @scienceangel, @suesa, @tristan-muller When: February 8th-9th, 2018Most of us will arrive on the 8th of February, and we will meet in the evening for dinner, in Meyrin (at a steak place or an Italian place, TBD). The CERN visit will start on the 9th in the morning (10:00AM) and ends at 6:00 PM, roughly. The detailed agenda We will meet on the 8th around 8:30 PM in Meyrin (Switzerland) to go to a restaurant and have food, drinks and fun. This event is open to anyone, but please let us know (on our dedicated discord channel) so that we can arrange the practical details. We will be scattered across Geneva and Saint-Genis for lodging, but the idea is to meet at the CERN main entrance at 10:00 AM. We will have 5 cars available to help us to move around the place (the LHC is a 27-kilometers-long circular collider; definitely not walkable). Thanks in advance to our 5 drivers @alexs1320, @aurel.proorocu, @dber, @justtryme90, @tristan-muller. We will visit the two permanent exhibitions of CERN, namely the Microcosm and the Universe of Particles. They are really worthy to visit. @lemouth will be our private guide. For this part of the meetup, any last-minute participant could come. Please contact us (again) on discord for details. We will have lunch on the way to CMS, located in Cessy. There is a nice Indian place in Ferney-Voltaire (France). By the way, Cessy is also a place where Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, lived some time ago. During the first part of the afternoon, @lemouth will give a particle physics crash course so that you could understand what you will be supposed to see during the visit of CMS and of the LHC. He has started to post some lecture notes on steemit. #1, #2, #3 and #4. The slides are (partly) available on google drive. We will go down to the LHC and get a private tour of CMS from 17:00 to 18:00. We will get two CMS guides just for us so that the meetup participants can enjoy this as much as possible. The meetup will end right after the visit. RulesThere are a couple of things to keep in mind when visiting CERN. All visitors must carry their ID or passport when they are on site. Moreover, please read this document with the safety rules for the visit. And for those not attending?No worries. We plan to take plenty of pictures and also do some video recording to bring the experience home for you all to share as well. This looks to be an amazing community building event! All SBD rewards of this post will be used to support the trips of the 20 participants, as well as to to fund the @steemstem project functioning and future activities.

Todays post is no exception! Check it out! ### Reliable information or manipulative content? Spot the difference! The internet is filled with lies, information passed off as fact, but that has no basis in reality. One of the biggest challenges WE (and that means all of us) will face in the future is how to sort fact from fiction, truth from bullshit, science from pseudoscience. Take some time and read through this post where @irime goes through some examples of the use of logical fallacies to drive false information into our brains. We need to train our selves to think better, to employ logic, to be more rational, if we are to navigate our way through the confusing information being shot at us from all directions. _ ## Saturday ### How can our heart keep beating on it’s own, over and over till we die - Understanding Electrical Activity of the Heart How does the human heart work?

Just like the title implies, the amazing element of life, Nitrogen is much more present and important than we think. Taking up almost 4/5 of the earth’s atmosphere, it is an element worth learning more about and @whileponderin gives us a great presentation in his post! ### Cockroaches Explained: Useful or Just A Disgusting Insect? You hate them, you find them disgusting, but there are cuisines that have them on their menu. Coackroaches, those Die Hard insects are more amazing than disgusting and studying them has a lot to offer. Check out this post from @filotasriza3, maybe when finishing it you will despise them a little less. _ ## Friday ### The Uyuni Salt Flats in Bolivia are Powering Half the World’s Batteries Our wonderful @kerriknox takes us on a trip to discover the amazing salt flats of Salar De Uyuni. Follow her steps and learn more about the place that provides us with the lithium that powers almost half of the world’s batteries. Who knows, maybe your phone is powered by a nature’s wonder! ### Microwave Ovens: Turning waves into weapons We bless the man who invented them, but do we know how these appliances that so conveniently heat up or even cook our food work? @henrychidiebere explains it very well in his post about microwaves and how a technology used so widely is communications and satellites, is finally adjusted to help us in the kitchen. ## Saturday _ ### Neurotheology - What the Heck Is That?! @saunter introduces us to Neurotheology a bizarre “mixture of scientific approach to unusual phenomena, undeveloped methodology, strange marketing and (above all) attempts to understand the important area of our lives - faith and spiritual life.” ### Criminаl Psychology: The motivаtion of the Frаudster In this exciting chapter criminal phychology @dysfunctional teaches us about the factors that motivate the fraudster and why it is important to understand their motivations. _ ## Sunday _ ### EGYPTOLOGY: The Hibis Temple at Kharga Oasis in Egypt @laylahsophia continues her tour on Ancient Egypt, taking us this time in the Hibis Temple, one of the most impressive temples of the Late Period (664–332 BC) up to the Greco-Roman Period (332 BC to 395 AD) of Ancient Egypt. ### Cutting, Pasting, Cloning, and GMOs Until the 1960s scientists knew the genetic code was made up of 4 letters and that’s pretty much all! Just a long chain of 4 letters one after the other with no clear boundaries of where one gene ended and another began. But as @alexander.alexis explained in his latest post, all that changed whenscientists came up with methods to cut, paste, and then clone DNA. _ A few words about the nomination process For the sake of transparency we feel we need to clarify how our nomination process works; each issue is compiled by certain members of the SteemSTEM community.

It’s come to our attention that more information is needed when it comes to the complex system of copyright law in the SteemSTEM community and Steem on the whole. If you’ve used images in your posts, the chances are you’ve broken copyright law in some way without even knowing; you’d need to be a professional to truly get it right. It’s very complicated. Furthermore, different countries around the world have different stances on the matter, from ‘Copywhat?’ in China, to ‘I’ll sue you for everything you’ve got’ in the USA. With that in mind, it’s far better for us to just play it safe and spend a few minutes understanding our position in the legal framework of blogging. ### Why bother? For most people, the idea of getting away with it is a tempting one, and the reality is, you probably will - until you don’t. As Steemit grows more into the public eye, legal issues will become an increasingly dominant issue, with lawyers actively seeking out such breaches of law for their clients, and artists expressing increasing frustration for a website that has already earnt the reputation of a lawless community. The idea here is twofold: To stop the habit of copyright infringement before its roots take hold and you suddenly find yourself in trouble a few months from now To prevent potential liability of others in the community’s unwitting felonious acts. Given that we all have a different level of understanding of what copyright actually is, I’ll start from the bottom and work my way up: # What is copyright? Copyright is a legal right. When an image has copyright, the creator has a limited period where they have exclusive rights to said image, if they wish. What many people don’t know is that copyright is established as soon as the image is created. As soon as you throw a tub of paint onto the canvas, that has copyright law attached. Because it is a right, there is no need to go to some public office to get your paperwork approved legally or anything like that. It just is. It is up to the original owner to decide how their work is to be treated, distributed or manipulated and this is something you should look out for when taking images from the internet. So here’s a guide to keep in mind in the future: ### Public Domain This is hopefully where most us Steemians will be spending our time, but we need to distinguish between images that are copyrighted, and ones that are public domain - material exempt from copyright law such as names, idioms, memes (for all intents and purposes), government work and so on. With Google, you can quite easily find the advanced usage rights options in image search which often (but not always) provide Public Domain imagery Simply go to Images –&gt; Tools –&gt; Usage rights –&gt; Labeled for reuse, and this will likely lead you to images from sites such as Pixabay, Flickr and Wiki Commons: But even these websites abide by the following system: ### Creative Commons Creative commons licensing is not simply applying the right to do whatever you want with an image and make sweet, sweet STEEM from it. It is simply a non-profit Organization in the USA designed to expand legal use of creative material. Their licenses are found everywhere - including Wikipedia - and come in numerous forms you should be sure to check: CC0 is equivalent to public domain. Attribution (BY) allows the same rights as public domain including for commercial use - as long as you give credit to the original author ShareAlike (SA) allows you to do the same, but any variation or manipulation thereof must abide by the same open terms as the original. Noncommercial (NC) is pretty much what it sounds like. You can share it as much as you want - without making money from it. NoDerivatives (ND) limits usage to purely the original state. Modification is not allowed unless permission is otherwise granted. You may see combinations of these states of copyright, for example you might find BY-ND, which allows you to share only the original work, but permits commercial usage. Or you might see BY-NC-ND which means you have to credit the author, you cannot manipulate the image, and you cannot make money from it. You can find the info on the bottom right of images in wikicommons. This image can be used however you please, but cannot have extra rights added to it and the author - Аркадий Зарубин (Arkady Zarubin? My Russian is rusty) - must be credited # Fair Use This is kind of the exceptions to the rule of copyright, and it’s where a lot of grey area kind of sits awkwardly, waiting for somebody to slip up. Mistakes here can be found all over the Internet from YouTube to, well, Steemit. Fair Use allows limited, commercial use of images and words for the purpose of research, education or even simply to benefit the public as a whole. When it comes to commercial use, this really boils down to a case-by-case basis, and if you’re using specific images you can’t otherwise find on Google, it’s a good idea to check the website’s FAQ section or contact the owners themselves. Each website and company will likely allow varying degrees of usage, so it’s important to check if you’re not sure. In the case of sciencex.com: &gt;Students, teachers and professors are free to use, reproduce articles and copy Science X content for academic purposes without obtaining prior written approval. The only request is users shall provide a credit and source URL link of the original Science X article. &gt;Users may copy, transfer or reproduce up to 200 words of an article or story and then insert a hyperlink back to the original Science X content. By following these steps, no prior written or oral permission is required.Source In the case of the comic XKCD: &gt;you’re free to copy and share these comics (but not to sell them).Source And in the case of YouTube, well, there is no specified duration of using a video clip in a manner of fair use, but its usage should be sensible, basically. # Open Access Journals If you are looking for more specific information on STEM-related subjects, it can be an incredibly expensive and annoying process, especially for bloggers who may want to find sources from numerous databases. That being said, there are tens of thousands of Open Access journals offering hundreds of thousands of articles with no legal boundaries to be limited by. There are many notable journals to be considered but for the sake of this post you can simply visit The Directory of Open Access Journals, browse the Wikipedia list of Open Access Journals , or search for what you need on *Google Scholar and check for copyright details in any given document, usually at the top or bottom of the paper. # It’s all too complicated! Yeah, that’s one of the main drivers of copyright theft. Ignorance is bliss right? But it’t not as hard as you think. Pixabay; right where you can see it Look out for CC0 or public domain images. Use the advanced search tool on Google and briefly check the image rights - for the most part, the results will be acceptable and plentiful. Check the information readily available on the websites you take your images from Contact individuals whose unique images you want to use And really, you should make sure to credit the image source no matter what. It’s just easier this way. But this doesn’t protect you from infringement if you don’t abide by the above rules. It just helps your case. DO NOT Simply provide a link to the wikipedia homepage or the fullscreen image of a google result. The goal here is to credit the author/creator. By providing a link to the image on Google, that doesn’t provide any clue to who created the image, and so it’s a waste of your time. It only takes 5 more seconds to provide the correct link.In fact, this whole process should really only add a few extra minutes to the work you put in and results in your contribution to the health of Steemit, SteemSTEM’s contribution to the academic community and a good, honest day’s work. If when writing a SteemSTEM post you still need help searching for research information that is public domain, or are generally confused about one of the many grey areas, there are plenty of well-informed veterans and willing helpers to guide you in the right direction on our SteemSTEM discord server, which you should have joined by now already, anyway!

As that is not entirely correct, we chose to give out a statement. How does cheetah even work? Cheetah is a bot, that means for the initial comment, there isn’t a human checking your post. It’s scanned and compared to content found on the web, to spot any copies. If it finds something, it leaves a comment and upvotes the post. This alone is not a reason to not get a steemSTEM vote! If the link left by cheetah isn’t even remotely related to what you’ve posted, you can contact @patrice and she will change the comment. If cheetah is correct and the link it left is indeed one of your sources – which you quoted correctly! – just answer to cheetah, telling it that yes, this is your source. Nothing further is required. But the last option requires you to quote your sources correctly. That does not mean it’s ok to copy a large amount of text, as long as you mention the website you got it from at the end. Try to only directly copy short quotes (if you have to), write what you want to write in your own words, add your own content and quote the source. No, BuzzFeed is not a good source for scientific content – as long as you’re not writing about the phenomenon of “10 things that will surprise you!” lists. If you have, in fact, plagiarized, your post will not be curated by steemSTEM. But that is not cheetah’s fault, only your own. And if cheetah has to warn you several times, you will be blacklisted and flagged by it. At that point, a vote by steemSTEM is very, very unlikely. Other reasons you might get blacklisted are identity theft or deception, for which the blacklisting is immediate and permanent. I am not blacklisted and steemSTEM still didn’t vote my post! Here is a list of reasons why your post might not have been upvoted: You’ve broken copyright law with the pictures you are using. No, “google images” is not a picture source. No, not every picture can be used for commercial purposes (which Steem is!). No, just because you “found it on the web” doesn’t make it free of copyright. Please click here for our post on copyright. Your post isn’t up to our standards. If you want to know what those are, click here. You keep asking us why your post didn’t get curated/only got such a low vote. Don’t do that. We get so many of these messages each day and in 99.9% of cases, there’s a good reason we didn’t curate it. We’re not that many people, we all have responsibilities outside of Steem and we absolutely do not have the time to explain to you in detail why we didn’t vote your post. You are not entitled to a vote, just because you tagged your post *steemstem*! Your post reads like a Wikipedia article and is as exciting as a soggy piece of bread. We simply didn’t see it. Sorry, there are so many posts with the tag on a daily basis, and we check the other related tags (science, technology, …) too. Just keep posting good content, we will see you at one point. And if you can’t wait, because you want your money, now! … You might have missed the point of this initiative. We’re not here to give you the highest payouts possible. We’re here to give STEM a place on the blockchain – not make individual posters rich. If you’re curious about how the curation progress works or what the general structure of our community is, click here. In Conclusion Getting a comment from cheetah is not the end of the world – as long as it’s a false positive. And even then, you have plenty of time to change our behavior for the better. If you’re not getting curated, there’s a reason. Don’t message the curators about it, the probability of it changing things for the better is low. It’s more likely that we remember you in a negative way. If you need anything from us (that isn’t upvotes), please contact our Public Relations Representative @suesa because that’s why we have her. The other members of steemSTEM management are not the correct people to contact, if there are any problems that aren’t specifically linked to them. We hope that this post clears some things up and maybe reduces the panic felt by a few when cheetah comments.

Does it do it naturally, artificially or through topical application? A billingual post by @farmacistasmz on the different ways of drug administritation. Read the first part and wait for what’s coming up next. ### Equipment of Filtration, Part 2 The second and last part of @akeelsingh’s posts on the filtration process. In this part you can learn about the different media and the advantages and disadvantages of each use. _ ## Friday _ ### PSYCHOLOGY: Attachment: Stages of building first relationships A psychology post by @smashedturtle on the term of attachment. What stages do we have to go through before an attachment with another person is established? Read on to find out. ### Garlic: A Survey Into Its Antibacterial Properties @lesshorrible takes a closer look at garlic and it´s potential health benefits. Can it really help in disease prevention as many claim? _ ## Saturday ### Remembering Comet Hale-Bopp Comet Hale–Bopp is a comet that was perhaps the most widely observed of the 20th century, and one of the brightest seen for many decades. In this post, @terrylovejoy remembers his personal experience with it as he was to observe the comet from discovery in July 1995 all the way through to 1999. H ### Optogenetics – A comprehensive guide In this article @jepper uses information from his previous works to give us an overview of how optogenetics work as well as to give a bit of a historical background to the method. ## Sunday ### Brief Overview of what Internet of Things (IoT) is all about You have probably heard the term “Internet of Things (IoT)” or maybe the saying that we now live in smart cities and homes. But what does it mean? @aliyu-s has us covered! ### Circulating Tumor DNA: A non-invasive way to detect cancer early Cancers are a pain. However, they can now be tracked through their DNA circulating inside our bodies, which thus offers an incredibly good way to detect them in a non-inasive fashion. For more informatiion, please read this post of @tking77789. A few words about the nomination process For the sake of transparency we feel we need to clarify how our nomination process works; each issue is compiled by certain members of the SteemSTEM community. This week’s editorial team was comprised of @ruth-girl, @trumpman and @lemouth. The editorial team chooses their favorite posts for the week and each issue is the result of their joined effort. In order to keep the process fair, posts written by the editorial team are excluded from the nomination process. Don’t be discouraged if you didn’t make it on this issue. The competition is harsh and there is always a next time :) In the meantime, you may wish to check these guidelines for extra tips on how your writing can be more effective. Authors That Received a Curie Upvote by the SteemSTEM Team ___ In the same spirit of being transparent about our actions that are now supported by @curie, we will release every week a list of authors who have caught the attention of the @steemstem curation team. If you want to discuss this with us, please do not hesitate to join the steemSTEM discord server or to follow our curation trail (just ask us for more information on the chat for details). From February 25 to March04, we rewarded 184 different authors who have written a total of 279 different articles.

Our goals were simple: Promote good STEM content on the Steem blockchain; Create a community (with engagement and activities). The first of these goals was achieved quite nicely, thanks in particular on some comfortable delegation we received a few weeks ago. Here are the statistics some of you may ask about how we use this delegation. In blue, the number of posts we upvote with the steemstem account week after week. We are reaching some maximum those days, but very importantly, the exponential growth of early 2018 can be observed. In green, the same information but presented in terms of the number of unique authors we upvote every week. We are probably not distributing STEEM as much as what could be done with memes or development projects, but this shows that the scientific (or actually STEMistic) community on STEEM gets sizeable. Finally, in yellow, you can see that our weekly available voting power is mostly used at the 100% level. However, to achieve this goal, our team members were slaved away to find, read and vote good content, engage wit the users on discord, in the comments of their posts. In other words, they work as much as you would expect for a full-time job with getting minimum pay. You can check the @steemstem wallet to see how much each get. And remember, none of the 19 involved people is eligible for curie-votes. In addition, some of them have a 60 hours per week job, dedicate 40 hours to steemstem every week and have also a well-filled private life. In short, we do that mostly on a voluntary basis. More and more people joined, more and more posts were voted … more and more people complained. Yes, we all work for free to get barely a ‘thank you’ and mostly people complaining about their super-hyper post not being upvoted, or because their pay-check is not large enough. The feeling of entitlement grew. And at the same time, number two of our goals barely happened. One small team cannot replace the engagement of a community: commenting, voting, encouraging each other. That is what we hoped our members would do. Some do. Most do not. As a result of all of this, we will now take a break of a week and try to restructure. There will be next to no votes from the steemstem account. We will not explain to you in detail why your post was not voted. We need some time to figure out how to carry on, why to carry on. Because if the community is not a community but just a bunch of people trying to milk steemSTEM as much as possible, there is no reason to keep going. This does not have to be the end. We don’t plan to shut it all down for good. We just need a break, some air to think. I hope you all can understand that. And if you have ideas about how to improve, or about what you could do for steemSTEM, feel free to comment our post. We will try to answer everyone.

If not, you should. Please follow this link before reading on. Essentially, it was all about engagement. But what is engagement? ENGAGING EACH OTHEREngaging with each other means acting as a community - and having fun! But fundamentally, creating the opportunities to have fun within that community. I recommend reading the comments made by @kryzsec on the previous post. Let it be known that steemSTEM is not just about the money involved. On top of getting a steemSTEM upvote, here are some suggestions: - Give tips to users on how to improve their writing (markdown/html, style, format, etc.) - Comment and ask questions on others’ posts, or even better, create discussions. Of course, this does not mean doing that on every single one of the 300 posts we consider each week, but simply whichever ones you are actually interested in. - When writing posts, one could also consider leaving points open to trigger such discussions and questions. - Write response posts (please do not attack others, but engage an adult discussion with arguments). This could also be a pair of collaborative posts (author A writes part 1 and author B writes part 2 for instance). - Vote on content and comments, either manually or trail the @steemstem vote. - Write about something you are passionate about and share it with us. This list is not exhaustive, but it is a good start! MORE ABOUT CURATIONIt is time to let you know how steemSTEM curation works, in the spirit of transparency. Our team scours the platform for original and quality content and then decides about the voting strength (small, medium, large) with which the post should be voted. Medium and large votes always require a second curator to double-check and confirm. We also have a moon-ish option that is used maybe 3-4 times a month. We try to be as generous as possible with the small votes. It is perhaps only a small amount of SBD, but keep in mind this is easily 50 times more than what many users get on STEEM… And what do you think we prefer? Giving 100 SBD to a single individual, or give 25x4 SBD to 25 unique authors? But sometimes, some posts are really, really great and we are trying to be there to support them as well! This being said, the rewards we give come mainly from our partnership with @curie, and this comes with some golden rules: Golden Rule 1The 18 people in our team (managers, general curators and community curators) are not eligible for this curie vote. In short, the curators and the management get a pay cut for joining the cause (we share the curation and distilled rewards, which gives 2-20 STEEM per person per week for an often full time schedule). Golden rule 2Okay, @steemstem has a comfortable delegation. But this doesn’t fully compensate: a single individual cannot get more than 2.75% of all steemSTEM votes cast during the last 2 weeks. And this percentage may actually go down in the future. This applies to staff, management, authors; everyone. We are of course not exempt from the posting standards of steemSTEM either; we have to work hard on our own content just like everybody else. In summary, the team gives for free. In addition, this takes so much time that they post less. But it is our choice to be a part of this and we are making these sacrifices for a cause we strongly believe in. So, every time you get a steemSTEM upvote, think about what that means, and think about what you can do in return to make the community a more fulfilling environment. Why not throw a few comments or votes to any other steemstem-considered posts in exchange? Help us build the community that we alone simply cannot grow. Discover like-minds and engage with them on discord. It’s up to you! CURATION AND HONOR MEMBERSTo try and improve on these problems of engagement inherent on the STEEM blockchain, we have implemented a test scenario that will be deployed item by item at some point next week. Curation We made our private voting channel public. No more excuses about not knowing what the posts we reward are, and how strongly we reward them… If you see an interesting topic, just click on the link, read and comment (and potentially throw an upvote)! If you have no time to do that but want to use your VP for @steemstem, you can either join our homemade curation bot (check the pinned messages on our discord channel for the how to), or just follow @steemstem on @steemauto (here). If you’d rather not do this, SP delegation is also a solution! With steemconnect and this simple form, it takes at most 5 seconds. For now, this is simple enough and we hope this will lead to some improvements we can all be proud of. Honor membersWe created the concept of steemSTEM Honor Members. You can apply for the position here. We (@steemstem) will read through the applications, check the qualifications and then pick the ones we think are suited to do this job. The choice could be made because of their write-ups, their level of engagement, the way they welcome and guide the newcomers, etc. Our steemSTEM Honor Members will be easily identifiable on the discord. There are three main tasks, from which each honor member can pick one, two or all three: Mentor newcomers and steemians who want to become successful STEM posters (helping inside the general chat room, taking on people who messaged management for help, actively seeking out steemSTEM/related posts to give out advice in the comments). Monitor the (freshly created) public “complaint room”, where people can complain about anything (in particular why their super-awesome post has not been curated), and rant in front of everyone. The management and curators will from now on systematically block any private complaint about upvotes; there are more than enough posts in the useful links channel to get even the most naive individuals started. Be our engagement officers, checking the comment/answer/vote behavior of steemstem-supported people. No matter how good their content is, people refusing to engage will naturally see less support from the community. As a reward, our Honor Members will have access to some secret channels and cool colors for your names on the discord. Who hasn’t dreamt about that? SUMMARYAs of this post, we are back in business, and we will try to make these changes as well as further developing our long-term goals.

About a month has passed since then, and we’re ready to give you an update on one of the most important changes: The Honor Members. Honor Members are members of steemSTEM who, after being assigned the role by the management team, voluntarily help improve the community. For this, there are three different categories: The MentorsYou might have encountered them by now. The mentor team is scouting posts in the steemSTEM tag and offering advice on copyright, structure and generally improving STEM posts. They also take on individual mentees if the need arises. The mentors are not curators, so while they can explain how a post can be improved and lend a helping hand, they are not able to guarantee anyone upvotes. Their advice, however, should not be ignored, as they help us keep track of users that cause trouble for the community. Over the past month, mentors have becomean integral part of steemSTEM and continue to go beyond all expectations on a daily basis. The Engagement OfficersA community isn’t a community if everyone is just sitting their with their own posts, waiting for upvotes. That was the original problem which made us take a break: People not caring about the community. While you can sometimes see engagement officers give feedback on posts too, their main job is to faciliate interactions between community members. Comments on other’s posts and upvotes inside the community are desired, someone who doesn’t participate at all isn’t helping the community move forward. One of the most important tasks the engagement officers do on a weekly basis is checking up on those, who receive the highest votes from @steemstem (the list is usually published in the “steemSTEM Distilled” on Thursdays). Those who receive a lot of monetary support should also be those, who are an active part of the community. Engagement over several weeks is tracked. In case one high voted member barely interacts outside their own posts (or not even on their own!), the highest maximal vote they can possibly receive is reduced. This does not mean they are blacklisted! Good content will still be rewarded, just not as much as it would be if said steemSTEM members engaged more. If engagement with the community increases, the highest maximal vote goes up again too. Complaints Room ModeratorsThe steemSTEM discord server has a channel called “complaints-room”. If you feel like you’re being unfairly treated or that steemSTEM is doing something wrong, please head over to that room and state your complaints. One of the moderators will help you. Please do not message individual management members or curators with your complaints! Really use that room! If you have an issue that is not directly related to steemSTEM (account is not being confirmed, your account has been stolen, …), please join the #help room on steem.chat and seek assistance there. Our Honor Members so farHere’s a full list of our current honor members (names as they appear on discord) and their respective tasks (M = Mentor, E = Engagement Officer, C = Complaints Room Moderator): alexdory (M, E, C) anevolvedmonkey (M, C) bachuslib (M, C) chloroform (M, C) christinaa (E ) dexterdev (M) Egotheist (M) gra (M) JPederson96 (M) katerinaramm (C, M) kingabesh (M, E) lesshorrible (M) MathOwl (M) Mountainwashere (M, C) noble-noah (E, C) pangoli (E ) Pearlumie (M) physics.benjamin (E ) Rharphelle (E ) sakura1012 (E ) samminator (M) scienceangel (M) simplifylife (M) terrylovejoy (M, E, C) robotics101 (M, C) If you need a mentor, feel free to message one of those marked with an “M”. If they don’t have time for you, they’ll ask a different mentor. Please avoid messaging several mentors at once, to avoid confusion. Want to become a Honor Member?If you want to become an honor member, there are some things you should be aware of: There’s no preferential treatment when it comes to upvotes. Honor members, just like everyone else (including management!) need to write good STEM posts if they want a @steemstem vote While we don’t expect honor members to work 24/7, constant absence without reason (announced “normal life” reasons like exams, child birth, vacations and sick time are totally fine) will lead to the exclusion from the honor member program Honor members are the backbone of our community and thus serve as role models. You will have to act like it If you’re aware of these things and still want to apply, send a DM on discord to @suesa (Suesa#4095) with an explanation why you’d like to become part of the team. The BeginningAside from the creation of the honor system, we are excited for the growth and health of our whole team and community, and even more so for our near-future projects. We are slowly building something that will create a unique experience on the Steem blockchain, so follow us and join our Discord for more information!

Lots of positive changes have occurred in the last few months, and many more good things are to come, as is written below. However, before digging into all the glorious details, let’s start with a brief summary: [Credits: @elvisxx71] Fresh news on the accomplished steemSTEM community. Our updated philosophy, and how we curate STEM content (in 5 different languages). We of course illustrate our statements by statistics and numbers, as we are scientifically-minded people, after all. Very importantly, changes have been implemented within our curation rules! Future projects: a steemSTEM user interface, a steemSTEM merchandise shop and a new meetup for the most immediate future, although the big idea is to upgrade steemSTEM to a concrete platform for science communication. Of course, we cannot omit from this project update a mention to all our supporters (specific delegators and trailers, @curie, @utopian-io and @steempress-io). SteemSTEM in a nutshell and todayThe steemSTEM project was initiated almost two years ago with the aim of building a community of people interested in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) on Steem. We believe that making Steem a better place for STEM is crucial for the long-term development of the platform as a whole, so that it could not only be friendly to quality, interesting and cutting-edge STEM content but also become a real platform for science communication while invigorating and inspiring the minds of the community and beyond. In order to accomplish this goal, we are of course showing support to STEM authors. But this support does not only consist in upvotes from the @steemstem account and its trailers. We additionally foster our members to act as a real community, which one can be a part of through our burgeoning discord server. This means we go beyond the ‘I estimate that I write a good post and I thus deserve a good pay-check’ paradigm. We actually encourage steemSTEM members to actually have fun reading each others’ posts, commenting on them and asking questions. In short, we develop interactions between the steemSTEM members. We are glad to see that our community is today stronger than ever, and this outcome has been in particular possible thanks to a great crew of steemSTEM honor members. SteemSTEM honor members are members of steemSTEM who voluntarily proposed themselves to improve the community. Their role consists in mentoring newcomers, helping them to write quality posts and engage the community. Together with the management and curators, the honor members also track fraud (plagiarism), help in detecting those who do not care about the community (and are only interested in a pay-check) and in handling complaints of those feeling unfairly treated by steemSTEM (from the complaints room of our discord server). ## Curation (June 2018 update) Our curation team scours the Steem blockchain for original and quality content related to the STEM fields in five different languages (English, German, French, Spanish and Italian). Using the #steemstem tag is recommended to facilitate our work, but not mandatory. After having found a post, a curator decides on the voting strength it should be voted (small, medium, standard or high). Anything larger than small requires a second opinion, and getting higher rewards means bringing something one cannot find anywhere else. This could for instance be an article about cutting-edge science not discussed anywhere else, or a novel and/or non-standard way of presenting a topic. In other words, science communication will be pushed forward from now on! On the other hand, we will try to be as generous as possible with the small and medium votes. Even if this consists of a small amount of SBD, this is easily 50 times more than what many users get. We will use this as a mean to promote informative content and make it more visible. Furthermore, a single person (manager, curator, author) cannot get more than a 2.75% share of all steemSTEM votes cast during the previous 14 days. Nobody from our team is also eligible for curie support. Since the beginning of our partnership with @curie on September 13th, 2017, we have upvoted 8937 posts from more than 1354 unique authors, sharing a pie of about 370,000 SBD. The detailed statistics about how many posts we vote on, how many unique authors we vote on week after week and how our weekly voting power is used can be seen here: As can be seen, there is a strong correlation between the Steem price and the general authoring behavior on the platform. ## A better window on steemSTEM: Our future UI and merchandise shop ## In order to increase the visibility of our initiative, we are currently designing our own user interface. It will allow users to filter the content of the blockchain and display, by default, all posts upvoted by steemSTEM together with all posts written by authors added to a steemSTEM white-list. In this way, we will be able to show a cleaner version, according to our standards, of the STEM content on the blockchain. With this on the hand, we hope to be able to convince external contributors, like renowned science bloggers and scientists in general, to join Steem as a perfect place for the diffusion of the scientific culture. Moreover, we are in parallel developing an online merchandise shop where steemSTEM goodies, books and many other STEM-related items will be offered. As for any other user interface, the steemSTEM UI will also allow users to directly post, do transactions, etc. More information will be made available in a couple of weeks. In terms of timeline, we hope to deploy our UI within the summer period. As usual with development projects, delays could however be expected. This UI sub-project has been funded by the team, i.e. managers and curators, who are getting reduced shares of the curation rewards for the last 2 (and next 5) months. ___ ## The second steemSTEM meetup [image credits: LIGO] As you probably all know, the last Nobel prize in physics was rewarding the discovery of gravitational waves (see here for some physics). For this reason, it is natural to move from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, where our first meetup was organized, to VIRGO, one of the three detectors currently probing spacetime for gravitational waves. As can be seen on the official VIRGO agenda, our visit is planned for September 21. For this reason, we are happy to pre-announce the second steemSTEM meetup. We will meet in Rome, on September 20-22. Please save the dates!More information will be provided soon. Special thanks and closing remarksBefore closing this post, we want to thank all our supporters. This includes our long-standing partnership with @curie who trusted us as representative of the science community on Steem as well as our recent partnership with @utopian-io who decided to use a very generous fraction of its voting power to trail valuable and interesting content related to science, technology and open source development. Moreover, we are grateful to @steempress-io who trusts our curation of any science-related content posted on steempress as a validation of its quality. SteemSTEM would not be what it is without those delegating some of their Steem Power to us. We have been delegated today 61 kSP from both the management and @reggaemuffin, @minnowbooster, @xeldal, @tobixen, @lukestokes.mhth, @dber, @zest, @gra, @flyyingkiwi, @greece-lover, @mcfarhat, @katerinaramm, @alexdory, @anevolvedmonkey , @dexterdev, @singhtheripper, @physics.benjamin, @yann85, @lianaakobian, @robotics101 and @christinaa. Serendipitously, the @steemstem account is, will be, in few minutes or hours, 10 kSP large ;) We also thank all those trailing us, either through our homemade voting-bot (more information on our discord server) or via steemauto. The list is amazingly too long to be shown. And as well those who do not trail us automatically, but achieve instead an amazing job in manual curation! Finally, thanks to all of you (delegators, trailers and steemSTEM community members) for your trust and enthusiasm in our project! We believe we can make Steem a positive place for STEM aficionados. We hope it will become one of the big STEM communication platforms in the future, where scientific culture will be shared and enjoyed, and where relationships can be built.

After having organised a visit down at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in February 2018 (see here for the final report), steemSTEM is now bringing Steem to the Virgo research laboratory in Pisa (Italy) where research on gravitational waves is conducted. [Image used with permission from Virgo Labs] — ### DETAILS ### — The meetup will take place on the 20-22 September 2018 between Pisa (where Virgo is located) and Florence. The schedule is at follows: 20th of September: Day of arrival. In the afternoon, we will meet up to socialise, meet the SteemSTEM people hiding themselves behind the blogs and have dinner together. 21st of September: The group will drive to the Virgo lab in Pisa early in the morning. At 10:00 AM an introduction talk will be held, followed by a visit of the detector and a Q&amp;A session. Lunch is currently planned on-site, together with the Virgo staff. In the afternoon, we will tour Pisa, have dinner together and drive back to Florence in the evening. 22nd of September: On this day, we meet again around lunch time to have a chance to discuss the events of the previous day in a rested state. For the afternoon, we plan to visit the Natural History Museum of Florence. — ## HOW TO PARTICIPATE? — The venue is limited to 35 people. To be one of those, it is mandatory to register. To this aim: Leave a comment on this post Send a message to @suesa on the steemstem discord with your phone number and a scan of a valid ID. As a confirmation of your participation, you will be given writing permission on the channel dedicated to this meetup (where updated details about the event are to be provided). If a visa is needed to enter Italy, please contact @lemouth on the steemstem discord. Why asking for your phone number? For organisational purposes so that we can contact you quickly and efficiently if needed (a whatsapp group will be created). Why asking for your ID? We will allow you to enter an international research laboratory. There is no free lunch… We however ensure that your information will not be leaked. Please also make sure that you really have the time and money to attend. — ## FEE — There is no fee. While the visit at Virgo itself is free, the participants are expected to cover their own expenses (including travel and accomodation). Optimally, some individuals will have to rent and drive cars. SteemSTEM will do its best in (potentially partially) supporting the rentals. We will also attempt to reimburse the participants to a certain degree, as we did last time. This does *not guarantee we can pay you back anything. ## FINAL LAST WORDS ## [Credits: @elvisxx71] We hope to see you all there! SteemSTEM is pushing the limits further once again!

One of the main events at this meetup will be a group visit to Virgo Labs. To give you some insight into what that actually is, today’s post includes a short explanation about gravitational waves and why Virgo was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics. Attendance, @fundition campaign and some statisticsSo far, 29 people RSVPed and purchased their flight tickets. Where are they coming from? Mostly Europe, but also a decent number of people are coming from Asia and South America. As some of our members in Asia and Africa have yet to secure visas for the trip, they are not yet included in the statistics. Moreover, the spread in age is also interesting, with our participant birth-years ranging from 1977 to 2000, with a peak in 1990-1995. It is not as crazy as the spread of ages at the last SteemSTEM meetup - (our oldest participant was 76 and our youngest one was 18). Since registration is still open, we’re hoping for surprises. Gravitational waves and Virgo in a nutshellGravitational waves are small ripples distorting spacetime and are generated by ‘catastrophic’ events in the universe. By catastrophic, one actually means huge events like the merging of two black holes or two neutron stars. Such an event requires a huge mass of matter that can only be found in these cosmic monsters present in our universe. Even though these events are colossal in magnitude, we can only try to measure modifications of space in units of 0.0000000000000000001 meters. [image credits: LIGO] Thanks to lasers and interferometry, such tiny changes have been measured at three places on Earth: the two LIGO observatories in the US and the Virgo observatory in Italy. This international experiment yielded the scientists a Nobel Prize in physics in 2017. Gastrophysics, or the astrophysics behind gravitational waves, in considered innovative state-of-the-art science, and is thus a good reason to organize a crazy meetup of some of the top tech and science brains from this blockchain at one of the places this inspiring research takes place. Why pick the one in Italy? Various reasons including, but not limited to, the ease of travel for most participants from around the world. Want to know more about gravitational waves? Our own @lemouth will be happy to answer all your questions in the comments to this post. Help us get there!Moving all these people from their home to Italy takes a lot of funding, with some flights from distant locations costing up to 1000 USD. We would like to help our community afford this and this is where YOU come in. This initiative, in collaboration with fundition, is aimed to help do just that - collect additional funding for the meetup attendees. Every upvote counts and every donation makes a difference. At the time of writing, we have collected 1243 upvotes on our crowdfunding post, as well as four direct donations from @jakipatryk, @mahdiyari, @electronicsworld and @roj. Thanks to everyone, we have collected about 25 SBD in donation, and about 285 SBD in upvotes (which can vary until the post is paid out). We are, however, still far from our goal, and more help is needed to fund flights, accommodations and car rentals. Obviously, this will not go unthanked! As previously announced, you will be able to join our meetup virtually through livestreams, scheduled chats and whatever else we can organize for YOU with the funds we’ll have collected.

Instead of a mid-week distilled, we will discuss varied topics of interest to the community. What better way to start the day than by grabbing a cup of coffee and reading the latest News from SteemSTEM post, so that you can learn about what we are currently working on? Our Distilled Series From now on, the distilled will be posted on Mondays (or sometimes Tuesdays). Our favorite one-woman edition team (@ruth-girl) will still be in charge of finding 6 gems among all our supported posts: 2 from the beginning of the week, 2 from the middle of the week and 2 from the end of the week. The list of authors supported by the @steemstem partnership with @utopian-io and @curie will still be provided, as well as a few statistics. Towards a SteemSTEM User Interface We are currently working hard on the development of our own user interface on Steem. This will allow us to increase the visibility of the high-quality authors we support through filtering the blockchain of the posts that do not pass our quality requirements. Moreover, this UI will come with several additional features allowing us to better emphasize the various STEM categories, a whitelist of users visible no matter whether they get our support our not, promotion tools, login via Steemconnect, etc. That said, it’s important to remember that this is only the first step towards building a full STEM communication platform on Steem. Perhaps you would enjoy a screenshot… for fun: More information will be made available in the following weeks. Our Meetup @ Virgo Labs The preparation of the upcoming joint SteemSTEM / Utopian.io meetup at Virgo Labs, close to Pisa in Italy, is slowly moving on. We have started a @fundition campaign to support the expenses of the participants as much as possible. We have already secured almost 250 STEEM (from post payouts and donations). Please help us to cover the costs of the 29 confirmed participants from both the SteemSTEM and Utopian-io communities by visiting our last campaign update. A SteemSTEM Public Relations Team We are proud to pre-announce the birth of our PR team to be managed by @katerinaramm. The goal will be to ensure the presence of SteemSTEM on other social media like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram and possibly more. One could even dream about a future SteemSTEM wikipedia page! This will open new horizons to promote the SteemSTEM project and its authors outside Steem. Our plans include the introduction of the project to the outside world, a promotion of the most interesting blog posts and discuss with and attract potentially new contributors to Steem.

Famously now, one primary goal is to enjoy the tremendous and exciting privilege of visiting the Virgo Interferometer near Pisa, Italy, but there’s so much more food for the mind and soul in Italy to enjoy. So we decided to go on an intellectual tour of historic Florence! The Natural History Museum of FlorenceThis museum is also known as La Specola - The observatory, in reference to the observatory that was founded there in 1790. As you can imagine, the museum has a pretty rich history of its own, and its foundations lie in the Medici Family. Dynastic beginningsThe House of Medici goes way back to the 12th century, when the Medicis, recently formed, used banking and commerce skills to rise in power, wealth and influence all around Florence. Cosimo The Elder, by Alessandro Pieroni - Public Domain In 1434, when their dynasty was in its prime, Cosimo the Elder ruled Florence as an ‘uncrowned monarch’ his entire life. During this time, Cosimo was devoted to the arts and humanities and as a result, Florence blossomed into a cultural centre of renaissance. Suddenly, the City’s name, translated in English as flourish, had a much deeper meaning. The Medici family continued to support famed artists and thinkers (including three mutant ninja turtles!) like Donatello, Leonardo da Vinci, Michaelangelo and Galileo Galilei (who was not a mutant turtle), even commissioning some of them for various projects. After some ups and downs, the Medicis reached their peak around 1512, continuing to influence Europe with their love of the arts, while spreading their genetic makeup around the continent. By the time the rule of the Medicis came to an end, Italy was left with a beautifully developed region heavily influenced by this dynasty, with a proud history of talent and beauty over three centuries. But Florence isn’t entirely about external beauty. It’s what’s on the inside that counts, you know? La Specola’s HippoThe Medici’s humanities-loving legacy also left us with the observatory, which, among other things, houses an extremely bizarre stuffed hippo. No you didn’t read that wrong. Here’s a sneak preview: Available under Fair Use This is not some random stuffed prize, however. As it turns out, this hippo was the pet of Cosimo III, direct descendent of Cosimo the elder. For exotic reasons, he decided to keep the hippo, letting it roam around the astonishingly beautiful Boboli Gardens, located a stone’s throw away from the natural history museum: Ed Webster, CC 2.0 But the hippo is not alone, thankfully, accompanied by an almost infinite number of (badly) stuffed exotic animals and disturbing anatomical models from wax. I’ve had a look at these and trust me, they are dis-tur-bing. Ever seen a decapitated lower body with twins eternally cuddled together inside? Well, there’s 24 rooms of simiilar stuff, free of charge! Aside from the hippo, another masterpiece comes in the form of Botticelli’s Venus… only with all her guts on display, lungs, blood vessels and all. Botticelli’s Venus. Not quite what we’re going to see there… - Public Domain.jpg) La Specola is a contrasting gem among Florence, a city so beautiful that many visitors suffer from Stendhal Syndrome, a condition that causes dizziness, fainting, confusion and even hallucinations as a result of experiencing such otherworldly majesty. It may be refreshing to take a deep breath of fresh air from Boboli Gardens before diving into a nightmarish museum of skinless heads and wax fetuses for a while. Around and aboutThe Natural History Museum is, of course, not the only interesting thing in the area. In fact, right across the river are 5 other museums that fit a ‘collection’ of museums from the Medici Dynasty, including: Giardino dei Semplici - The third oldest Botanical Garden in Europe Museum of Botany Museum of Geology and Paleontology Museum of Mineralogy &amp; Lithology National Museum of Anthropology &amp; Ethnology So if 3 million zoological specimens spread around rooms named things like ‘The Hall of Skeletons’ makes you thirsty for more, Florence has brain food by the truck load! The city is clearly much more than first meets the eye. Excited? –@mobbs The MeetupFor more information on this meetup and our expected schedule, Check @steemstem’s post and @utopian’s post.

In this post, we have some exclusive sneak-peeks of the location where the Utopian.io team will be staying and holding an exclusive open source hackathon. The Utopian.io team members scheduled to attend this meetup will be staying together at a villa in the town of Lucca in Italy. While the place looks like a perfect spot for a relaxing vacation, we plan to spend much of the time collaborating on innovative new features for Utopian and its community. It’s why we made sure to select accomodation with wireless internet access and laptop-friendly workspaces. Source: Airbnb This lovely villa is due to accommodate all 17 registered Utopian team members attending, and host the guests to join us for the hackathon only. This means at least some of the team members will be sharing beds, so we’re expecting some bring home (to you) some funny stories, crazy livestreams and awesome photos and videos. About LuccaLocated between Pisa and Florence, Lucca is a medieval gem of history, art and culture dating back to 180 BC. Also nicknamed “the town of 100 churches”, Lucca is the home to some architectural masterpieces worthy of a visit including the Cathedral of St. Martin that also serves as an art museum, and St. Michael’s Church. Source: jimmyweee from wikipedia CC BY 2.0 Lucca is one of the only Tuscan cities spared aerial bombings in WWII, so its archeological and historical landmarks remain untouched and well preserved. One of the most famous ones is the medieval city wall surrounding the town, 4 kilometres and 223 metres turned pedestrian promenade and cycling path, offering a scenic route around the historic town. Though our time to tour and sightsee will be limited, Lucca can tempt us away from the keyboard with Orto Botanico Comunale di Lucca (botanical garden dating from 1820) and the narrow scenic streets of this ancient Italian town at the foot of the Apuan Alps. Source: Alessandro Vecchi from wikipedia CC BY 3.0 Another building that represents the city as an unusual one is Torre Guinigi - a tower with a garden on top! It was built when the Guinigi family sought to create a garden above the town as symbol of the town’s rebirth while under their control. This popular tourist attraction might be a long climb (230 steps), but it offers a unique view of the city and its surroundings. Lucca takes great pride in being the birthplace of the famed composer Puccini, so music lovers will be able to attend daily concerts of the local composer’s music in the Church of San Giovanni. His biggest fans might even find the time to visit his old home turned museum. About the HackathonAs we work hard to organize and crowdfund this international operation, we’re also working on a fun, exciting and global mini-hackathon to take place during the Utopian.io gathering in Italy. Anyone can participate from anywhere in the world, and we hope you will too. The Utopian.io mini-hackathon is scheduled to take place on one of the very few free days we will have at the villa in Lucca, when not touring Virgo and the Museum in Florence. If you happen to be in Italy in September and are interested in attending, please contact @techslut or @espoem on our Discord server. The exact dates and times of the hackathon and more details will be revealed in future posts, so stay tuned for more updates! –@techslut Help us get there!Many of our attendees from both @steemstem and @utopian-io are traveling from Asia and Africa to attend and contribute. The goal of this @fundition campaign is mainly to crowdfund the cost of travel from these places, including necessary visa applications and travelers’ insurance.

With two arms 3km in length, it’s one of the biggest machines ever made in the history of the world, behind things like LIGO and the LHC. All for science. But some mysterious figure didn’t just come up with it one day and had it approved for construction the next, the journey atop giants’ shoulders was long and wrought with complicated maths people like me could never hope to understand. Today I thought it would be worthwhile putting some time aside to learn a little more about some of the giants who constructed this monolithic structure with the power of their brains - Einstein aside. Henri Poincaré Public Domain A long, long time ago around 240BC, the Greek poet (also mathematician I guess) Eratosthenes decided to shove a stick in the ground in Alexandria, Egypt, and made another man travel to Southern Egypt to shove another stick in the ground there. By measuring the difference in shadows at the same time of day, he managed to figure out that the earth was round, and how big it was to surprising accuracy of between 1% and 16% (depending on how you measure ‘stadia’), roughly around 44,100 km. Quite an accomplishment given we now know it’s about 40,075.017km. Give or take. Though Eratosthenes managed to prove something he could not possibly see for himself - indeed we could not possibly see until space agencies took us into the Great Void Above - Poincaré decided he could essentially take this one step further do the same thing with the entire Universe. We call this the Poincaré Conjecture, for which he is most famous. You can Learn more about it in this video, but in short it took over a century of people coming up with false proofs for his outlandish idea to inevitably become proven by an eccentric, isolated Russian, Grisha Perelman who went on to turn down a million dollars and the equivalent of a nobel prize, the Fields Medal, before fading back into obscurity. But Poincaré is also responsible for first proposing the existence of gravitational waves, 11 years before Einstein made his predictions, something that both LIGO and VIRGO slipped up on in a publication a few years back, instead attributing to Einstein. By building on the theory of special relativity and the Lorentz Transformations, he concluded that gravitation must emanate outwards, at the speed of light rather than instantaneously, as waves do - in a similar fashion to Electromagnetism. A decade later, Einstein incorporated these ideas into his paper Approximative Integration of the Field Equations of Gravitation. References Sur la dynamique de l’électron | Henri Poincaré Predicted The Existence Of Gravitational Waves As Early As June 5, 1905 Oliver Heaviside Public Domain So Poincaré was the first, except… he wasn’t really. Oliver Heaviside was a rather brilliant Englishman, having self-taught electrical engineering, mathematics, physics and more. He was no mathematical amateur either. After stumbling upon Maxwell’s paper Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism. and describing it as: Great, greater and greatest, with prodigious possibilities in its power He buckled down for the better part of a decade studying Maxwell’s work with passion until finally following his own path. In 1893, a full 23 years before Einstein’s predictions, Heaviside made some pretty bold deductions. In his paper A Gravitational and Electromagnetic analogy, he wanted to align gravitational energy with the likes of electric and magnetic energies a la Maxwell. Upon considering velocity of propagation as finite, he continued his comparisons and concluded, roughly, the existence of gravitational waves. References The Prediction of Gravitational Waves in 1893 | The Secret History of Gravitational Waves Pierre-Simon LaplaceOk, so the idea that gravitation traveled at finite speeds was hardly new, with Laplace discussing this idea as far back as 1770. Numerous others had also touched on this, but the ideas, far from refined, required Poincaré and eventually Einstein to truly hammer home the details. In fact, it was Einstein alone who made the tangible, accurate predictions alongside details of their expected properties, such as how the waves wilil exhibit stretching in one direction and compressing in the other, much like sound waves and light, but way more complicated regarding the manipulation of space-time. But where’s the proof? Introducing: Kip Thorne, Barry Barish &amp; Rainer WeissIn 2017, these three lads won the nobel prize in Physics for the ‘decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves’! In 1984, the three co-founded the LIGO project in the US, and suddenly those elusive gravitational waves were about to lose their hiding spot. All of Einstein/Poincaré/Heaviside/Laplace’s work was falling into place. The workload was not a light one. Kip Thorne, for example, had to develop the mathematics in order to even be able to analyse the results should the experiment work, he had to analyse engineering designs that couldn’t conceptually be tested beforehand, he helped identify wave sources, provide theoretical support, he designed the beam tubes, and invented ‘quantum nondemolition designs’ and ways to reduce thermoelastic noise. All in a day’s work! Kip Thorne Credit: A. T. Service - CC BY-SA 3.0 On top of that, he even managed to squeeze in enough time to be the science advisor for Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’ - a movie that depicts the most scientifically accurate black hole known to date - a full 2 years before signatures of gravitational waves were officially detected. References nobelprize.org | Kip Thorne And here we are now, in 2018 (that is also the beginning of what is coined the gastrophysics era), a world where gravitational waves are a definitely real thing that we can almost touch with our bare hands. Ok, not quite. Detecting one of these waves is the equivalent of noticing the Milky Way stretched out about the length of your keyboard’s delete key. But we can touch the machines capable of doing that at say, oh I don’t know, the SteemSTEM-Utopian.io meetup in Italy in September!

Are you among the ones who love to see plastics burn? In this post you can read and learn about the different types of plastics and their melting points. Read that so that next time you’ll know what temperatures you’re gonna need for those plastic spoons and glasses you wanna see melting. ### Brewing without Hops: Genetically engineering yeast to make hoppy flavor Who doesn’t like beer (other than @abigail-dantes, of course)? And who can imagine beer without hops? Apparently, according to @tking77798’s fantastic post, hops might become unnecessary thanks to some genetic modification magic. Wanna learn more about it? Click on that link now! Saturday - Sunday ### We are relying on ancient rocket engine designs to shoot us into space! Is the Aerospike engine an alternative? @alexdory is famous for his technology posts and this is another one of them! Rocket engine technology is being discussed here: why are we still using remnants of the past and when is an air of innovation going to blow? All that written wonderfully by @alexdory! ### Mind Bending Effect Caused By Toxoplasmosis Might Have Made You Interested To Pursue Business! This week will close with a last gem of the SteemSTEM post pool, @conficker here examines the effects of toxoplasmosis on a person’s behavior.

New Social Media Accounts In short, we created new accounts and fully optimized them accordingly to the newest social media standards. If you are on other social media, see below and follow us! Please share with us any remarks, ideas, suggestions! Facebook PageYou can follow the official Facebook page of Steemstem and get updates about all new trending articles (trending according to our standards) and information on all SteemSTEM activities. Twitter AccountSome of you may be used to follow Steemstem on Twitter. However, due to an issue with Twitter which would not allow us to log in anymore, a new account needed to be created. So, feel free to follow, from now on, the only official SteemSTEM Twitter account. Instagram AccountYou can also find us on our official Instagram page as well. As for the other social media, this will allow one to get fresh information about the SteemSTEM project, extra promotion for the most supported posts and much more! What to expect - What is next? Why write for SteemSTEM?We realized that the importance of SteemSTEM is greater than simply a niche community to be read by a few on the Steem blockchain. Science communication is a vital force worldwide, yet there is barely enough incentive for researchers to communicate their work to the mainstream audiences. As a result, only the most positive, groundbreaking and bizarre stories get heard, often misinterpreted or spun in a way not unbefitting of the current culture of ‘fake news’ by mainstream media. SteemSTEM has a different approach. By offering a space where individual experts and passionate STEM bloggers can freely distribute their knowledge in a social media environment that actively promotes and rewards them, we cut out the middle-men and create a greater balance between quality and readability. Spreading knowledge is Unlimited knowledgeEspecially now, in this age of technological wealth, it is important to tell facts from fiction; it is important to move forward. There is a lot more to come; Stay tuned and Enjoy!

We decided to make a series of posts about prominent people who originated from this city, so that participants will be able to truly appreciate historical significance of Florence. ### Florence Nightingale, the “Lady with the Lamp” __ Florence Nightingale was born in 1820 in Florence, Italy, as a younger child of a wealthy, upper-class British family. She was named by the city of birth, which was pretty much the usual practice during the Pre-Victorian and Victorian era. Her father provided her with a good education in languages (German, French and Italian), mathematics, and history. As a rich landowner’s daughter, she was expected to pursue active social life in upper-class circles and to get married, but she was never interested in such a lifestyle. Strong-willed, introverted and religious, she was convinced that God had some other plans for her. Florence Nightingale, author Henry Hering (CC0 1.0) At the age of 24, Florence told to her parents that she wanted to become a nurse. For the rich ladies of that time, something like that was unthinkable, which was understandable considering unsanitary conditions in hospitals of that time (operations were even performed without the use of anaesthetics!). Moreover, nurses were considered to be the women of questionable morals. Despite her parents’ objections, she visited several hospitals and health institutions. Finally, she managed to obtain her parents’ permission to enrole at a German nursing school for women in Kaiserwerth. In the early 1850s Florence returned to London where she started a job in the hospital for Sick Gentlewomen in Distressed Circumstances. Shortly her outstanding performance draw the attention of her employer and Nightingale was promoted to superintendant, which was a very challenging position, but at the same time it provided her with the opportunity to implement her own ideas in running the institution. The Crimean War Nightingale’s most prominent contribution during her life was certainly in the Crimean war, which broke out in October 1853. The Lady With the Lamp, author Wellcome Collection gallery, CC BY 4.0 The hospitals at the Crimea were in appalling and unsanitary conditions at the time of the war. Having no stationary female nurses made the whole situation worse, resulting in inadequate medical care for the wounded/sick soldiers and horrible sanitary conditions. One year after the war started, in October 1854, Florence gathered 38 women volunteer nurses that she personally trained and sailed with them to the Crimea, to help thousands of soldiers who were fighting for their lives. When Nightingale arrived at Scutari, the British base hospital in Constantinople, the image she saw was horrifying - more soldiers were dying from infectious diseases that were the result of inappropriate sanitation than from actual injures obtained in the battlefield. Besides all the hard work she took on the improving the sanitary conditions of the hospital, she put all her efforts in improving the quality of patients’ stay in the hospital as well. She established a laundry service so that patients could have clean sheets all the time, and she made sure that patients with special dietary requirements would get appropriate food. Moreover, she considered entertainment and intellectual activities equally important for well being of patients, so she introduced classrooms and a library at the hospital. While she was checking up on patients during the night, she used to walk down the long hallways of the hospital carrying the lamp in her hand, and would approach every single patient to make sure everyone is doing well. That’s how she obtained her nickname The Lady With the Lamp. A Polar-Area Diagram invented by Florence Nightingale, author Florence Nightingale (CC0 1.0) Since she obtained an excellent formal education in mathematics, Nightingale calculated the incidence of deaths in the military which could be prevented by improving sanitary conditions. During her work at Scutari hospital, she developed the Polar-Area Diagram to present her results, which later evolved to the pie chart extensively used nowadays. This remarkable approach at the time was actually a pioneer work in the area of measuring particular social phenomena and subjecting it to mathematical analysis. According to the official statistics, during her year and a half long stay at Scutari, the hospital’s death rate was reduced by two-thirds. Later achievements After she returned to England, Nightingale was rewarded by queen Victoria with $250,000 for her amazing contributions and with special engraved brooch which became known as the “Nightingale Jewel”. She used the money to establish St. Thomas’ Hospital, and the Nightingale Training School for Nurses. She was the first woman to be awarded with the Order of Merit in 1907. She died in August 1910, in London, England. Nightingale’s most prominent contributions by which she is remembered are certainly for being a pioneer of nursing and for introducing reforms in hospital sanitation methods. With her outstanding work, the perception of nursing profession has changed, which started to gain more respect and appreciation.

We hence support about 200 of these posts, and present in this distilled our top 8 handpicked choices for the last Thursday-Sunday period. ## Monday - Wednesday ___ ### Peto’s Paradox, or Why Elephants Do Not Get Cancer? An angel of the STEM Heavens has written our first choice for this week, ladies and gentlemen, read a magnificent post by @scienceangel talking about elephants and… cancer. Why do these cute giants with the long trunks rarely get cancer? Is it their diet? Is it their size? Or is it something hidden deeper inside… their bodies? Now that we got you intrigued, you know what link to click on! ### Are We Born Criminals? Part I: The Positive Theory Look who’s back! No, we’re not talking about the German film, we’re talking about @dysfunctional who has given us one of his great posts again. This is the first part on the topic “Are We Born Criminals?” where he tries to present us with the work of Cesare Lombroso and the Positive Theory in Criminology. An interesting read you shouldn’t miss! Wednesday - Friday ### Anxiety without reason and it’s relation to fear and stress We are sticking to psychology and a fantastic post by @ideas-abstractas on anxiety. Do you feel under pressure without some specific reason? Does anxiety take over your life once too often and you don’t know what is at fault? Then, you’d definitely enjoy this post as much as we did. ### L’effet Placebo: How Lies Could Heal Our Bodies And we’re moving on to another great piece by @wordswithhoney on the Placebo Effect. No, it is not some side effect from listening to songs by Placebo (the band). This one is a trick that we play on our brains in order to fool our bodies. Wanna know more details? Then read @wordswithhoney’s post straight away! Saturday - Sunday ### Missile Technology - the weapon of destruction. [1st chapter] For those who love guns and war stories, we have an amazing post by @ied on missile technology. Don’t miss this post if you want to know more about how they work and how many types of missiles there are. ### Spaghetti on the road – Iceland, a song of ice and fire How about a journey to Iceland for our next and last pick for the week? Forces of fire from beneath and ice from above have shaped an island of unique beauty and a combination of features. Follow @spaghettiscience in this beautiful post about Iceland and the stories of its formation. A few words about the nomination process For some time, the editorial team behind this distilled series is made of a one-woman-team, @ruth-girl, and she chooses her favorite posts (potentially discussing with other curators and/or the management). Posts written by the SteemSTEM team are excluded from the nomination process. Please do not be discouraged if you did not make it on this issue. We are picking up in total 14 posts a week out of more than 200. The chances are thus low ;) In the meantime, you may wish to check these guidelines for extra tips on how your writing could be more effective. Authors upvoted by the SteemSTEM team In the spirit of being transparent about our actions that are now supported by @utopian-io, @curie, our delegators, our trailers and our manual curator supporters, we release every week the list of authors who have caught the attention of the @steemstem curation team. From July 22 to July 29, we rewarded 126 different authors who have written a total of 164 different articles (there was a Steem blockchain failure during that week).

This initiative has been growing alongside steemSTEM for some time now and has truly become an independent force on the Steem blockchain. As a sub-community of steemSTEM, STEMng - under the management of @gentleshaid and @greenrun - is focused on assisting the Nigerian community in promoting Steem through well-crafted, fun to read and fact-based STEM content that is devoid of conspiracies, gainsayings, untested hypotheses as well as copyright infringements. Community Building: Both On Steemit and on DiscordSince its inception, the management of the Nigerian sub-community has been working assiduously to consolidate on the support provided by the parent community (steemSTEM) and other stakeholders on the Steem blockchain to further foster community building through various activities that would increase engagement both within their discord server as well as in the comment sections of STEM content on the blockchain. One such activity is the Friday night hangout which usually takes place every Friday night and authors within the sub-community come together to have an open discussion on topical issues while cool music plays in the background. The hangout is occasionally garnished with the presence of influential members of the steemSTEM community; @justtryme90, @lemouth, the lovable @abigail-dantes, and @zest are some of the members that have graced the hangout. STEMng community also has an educational, fun-filled and interactive weekly quiz session which has also been held every Friday during the hangout. As a rule, after the maiden edition of the quiz was hosted by @gentleshaid, the winner of 1st position in any particular week would host the quiz the following week. This coming Friday would be the 4th edition of the weekly quiz and below is the summary of winners of the previous editions; | Edition| Host | 1st position |2nd position |3rd postion | | ——– | ——– | ——– |——–|——– | 1st | @gentleshaid | @samminator |@djoi |@prinsj |2nd|@samminator|@akeelsingh|@djoi|@emperorhassy| |3rd|@akeelsingh|@emperorhassy|@samminator|@kingabesh Hence, the host of the quiz for this coming Friday is @emperorhassy. In order to ensure that the same set of people do not win every week, a new rule coming into effect this week has been put in place such that no member can win more than once in a period of 4 weeks. To further encourage engagement the 1st place position has a price of 5SBD attached to it while 2nd and 3rd positions have 3 and 2SBD attached to them respectively. The STEMng Community Meetup Recently, as the community continues her growth on various fronts, STEMng had a meetup at the Lekki Conservation Center in Lagos, Nigeria and it was a great success. 18 STEMng members graced the meetup, some of them traveled hundreds of miles for the community. Some of the members present include @realjosh, @agbona, @funmiakinpelu, @gentleshaid, @amazonaesh, @eurogee, @synick, @thurllanie, @emperorhassy, @herbayomi, @djoi, @bookie, @temitayo-pelumi, @rharphelle, @samest, @sogless and a host of others. We hope for increased participation in future meetups, as the community continues to grow in size and flourish. Join usOf course, you don’t have to be from Nigeria to join us.

We decided to make a series of posts about prominent people who originated from this city, so that participants will be able to truly appreciate historical significance of Florence. # Life and work of Niccolò Machiavelli Very few names are at the same time so deeply connected to politics and political science while being frowned upon, when their ideas are actually implemented. Niccolò Machiavelli (3 May 1469 – 21 June 1527) was one of these people. His most notable work is called The Prince - which is, simply spoken, a regent’s guide to power and how to maintain it. In the aftermath of that book, the term Machiavellianism was used to refer to people and/or politicians who dared to use strategies recommended by Machiavelli in order to achieve their goals. Source But who was this guy anyway and why write now about him? As most of you may know already, the @steemstem and @utopian-io meetup this year will take place in Florence, Italy. And, since you are all smart guys, you will likely have deducted that Niccolò Machiavelli was born there and later played a significant role in Florence’s society as well. Although he had a successful career in politics for a few years – getting appointed at the office of second chancery, later he became the secretary of the Dieci di Libertà e Pace and finally he was put in charge of the Florentine militia – this success did not last. After the Medici took control over the Florentine city-state, Machiavelli was dismissed from his office and later thrown into prison because it was thought he was conspiring against the Medici. Regardless of the torture he had to endure there, he did not confess to any conspiracy and eventually was released after three weeks. Niccolò Machiavelli is considered as one of the first empirical (political) scientist, since he always drew conclusions based on experiences and facts as well as pointing out, how utterly pointless a mere theorizing without any empirical evidence would be. This can, of course, also be seen in his most famous work. ## The Prince Machiavelli put much emphasis on how important it is to carefully monitor the current situation of the state and then decide how to make the most out of it – meaning, how to take and maintain control. He usually described ideologies like religions as man-made and considered them only as a means to an end. If they were helpful to seize and maintain power, then a regent should use them accordingly, but not succumb to them. Instead of relying on meta-physical concepts like gods and wonders (and justifying their own power with it), he encouraged the rulers to take risks and have ambitions to change the very being of the state and its society in total – if deemed necessary. Innovation was therefore not something a regent should frown upon but welcome with open arms, if it can be used to strengthen his grip around the state. In contrast to most former political writers, Machiavelli had not much love for the classical good and evil dualism. In The Prince he describes extensively the various tasks a regent must fulfil, if he wishes to claim and maintain his power. Sometimes this can lead to somewhat extreme outcomes. According to Machiavelli, it is an acceptable mean to kill political opponents or act out other vicious deeds to establish a new government system. It should be noted though, that he puts a lot of emphasis on how to exactly do that. A wise ruler establishes beforehand how much cruelty he needs – and then acts according to it only once, because people tend to forget one immense cruelty faster than many continuous ones. In Machiavelli’s world it is by far better to be feared than to be loved, since love can be an obstacle, if it is necessary to use violence against opponents, but if the regent is feared anyway, this is just a logical reaction. Although it is important to find the subtle balance between mere fear and hatred – a regent whose citizens despise him, will eventually have to deal with revolutionary actions and betrayal. Fear, on the other hand, can be used as a handy tool to establish control but not pushing the limits of one’s citizens beyond of what they are willing to endure. In conclusion, it can be noted that Machiavellianism can be used as a way to seize and maintain power, using opportunistic and sometimes immoral means. This is also the reason why in modern psychology the term Machiavellianism is considered as one of the dark traits of personality inside the so-called dark triad. People who score high at this trait tend to be more ego-centrical and focused on personal success – even if that means they have to exploit others to achieve that. Even today, the work of Niccolò Machiavelli has still quite some impact on various scientific disciplines and every day life. The city of Florence was the birthplace of some truly great minds – making it only logical to be the very gathering spot for great minds from all over the world.

Active since half a year, this initiative works on promoting STEM content within the important german community of the steem blockchain. banner by @lianaakobian The TeamDe-STEM is managed by @sco, who also serves as a language group curator. Also, several steemSTEM mentors/honor members, like @egotheist or @lesshorrible, are actively supporting german authors to improve the quality of their publications. Account and steemSTEM votesOur sub-community independently runs its own steem account: @de-STEM, which has grown consistantly since its creation and has long passed a voting power of 1000 SP. From there, outstanding posts posted in #de-stem are resteemed and upvoted. If german posts follow the criteria of steemSTEM, they will be forwarded to the steemSTEM curation team and - upon being reviewed - receive our generous upvote. Community BuildingReSTEMEvery one or two weeks, a dedicated post (“ReSTEM”) informs the community about ongoing developments, changes or challenges. Also, it provides statistics on given upvotes and a selection of particularly valuable posts for all people who don’t have the time to follow the #de-stem category on a daily base. Just as with steemSTEM’s “Distilled”, this aims at further motivating authors to publish quality content in regular intervals. DiscordA key to every community is - naturally - communication. De-STEM has its own discord chat, where you can hang out and discuss the latest STEM topics. You don’t even need to bring german language skills - the community is always happy to teach you important german every-day words like Behördenantragsübersetzungsformular or Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz! We can’t think of any reason why you shouldn’t speak german fluently within a week of chatting with us. C’mon!You speak german (or you did the discord class), and you are interested in reading, writing or discussing science, technology, engineering and mathematics? Then join us! Until then: Steem on!

As September looms over the aging, derelict month of August, the reality of the SteemSTEM/Utopian meetup is becoming, well, more real than it was before. We thought it would, therefore, be a cool idea to relate more tangibly with the awesome people who are actually going! So I asked around and found three members (more to come!) to introduce themselves in today’s post - however, they feel like it - and if anybody has any questions about them, drop ‘em in the comments and see what you may discover there! ### First and foremost, our resident Debunker has a tale to tell: # @egotheist Forged in the fires of Mount Doom, there he was born. One to rule them all…oh. Wait. Wrong story. As the tale goes, there once was a boy, foolish enough to venture forth into the mysterious depths of pseudo-science and dangerous beliefs. Misguided by his own kin, many years he was lost without proper orientation. Bought every lie he was told. Eventually, he met a mentor who revealed the most painful of all truths to him: everything he believed so far was no more than a fairy tale. But instead of mourning about his lost purpose he gathered new strength, some would even call it a grim determination: with his mentor’s help, he melted his mind, crushed every last fake belief he once held - and forged everything anew. Sharp like a razor, but at the same time durable like the Hulk’s green skin, the once foolish boy had now grown into a dangerous weapon, focusing only to destroy any kind of ill-belief without mercy. Although the boy was still struggling to determine his true and final purpose in life, he found at least some fulfillment in this new fight. Whatever the future might bring, he was willing to face every obstacle and challenge which may occur - gathering both knowledge and strength along the way. As long as he lived, he would always fight. ### Next up, a poetically haunting prose about: # @scienceangel Born and grew up at the wrong place, at the wrong time. Dedicated the first part of her life to correct the error the statistical randomness of the universe made. The rest of her life will be therefore filled with pure hedonism and indulgence. Allies are welcome. No time to waste. Ambitious and aspiring towards many areas of life, including science. PhD degree was only collateral. Served the purpose of a one-way ticket though. Enjoys spending time outdoors, cannot live without regular physical activity and deep conversations with very few people she cares for in her life. Has a profound passion for traveling and discovering wonders of nature and architecture, which should always be complemented by indulgence in high quality, carefully prepared food. Because life is one and life is now, nothing comes after, just eternal darkness. Her message to the world can be summed up in a quote of one extraordinary scientist: By all means let’s be open-minded, but not so open-minded that our brains drop out. Richard Dawkins Throughout history, we were able to witness devastating consequences of extreme close-mindedness for mankind, over and over again. Caution should be taken before we lose ourselves in the other extreme end of the spectrum, if it’s not too late already. ### Finally, all about the all-out altruist and voluntary taxpayer: # @alexdory Born in a family of STEM enthusiasts, raised with the concept of altruism and civism. Taught entrepreneurship since the early years, became a passionate computer enthusiast, made first money at 14 in Webdesign. Gave it all to his younger cousin to buy a computer so she can become a designer, which she later did. Likes to know how everything works, from the potato peeler to jet engines to genetics and to government policies and people. With a degree in programming and a passion for aerospace, he started working in a startup, whose mission is to provide affordable aviation services to the developing countries. Started working with 3D engines and shaders and stepped into AutoCAD and 3ds max. Worked as a one-man-team for a few years. Certified as an Air Traffic Controller Trainer by the company, met and made friends around the world, understanding that we are all the same, human beings with needs, emotions, goals and existential problems. Started out to solve some of them, starting with education which is the key for a successful individual development and social/civic awakening. Came to Steem to distribute the abundance we take for granted in some of our countries, while others only dream of the idea of it # So there you have it! The forces of evil have colluded to align the gravitational waves from a supernova somewhere to your left in a way that allows these three deviants to attend the SteemSTEM/Utopian meetup ONE MONTH FROM NOW. Let’s hope they don’t destroy each other like the anti-matter particles of society they are.

SteemSTEM aims to make Steem a better place for STEM, a task which we believe crucial for the long-term development of the blockchain. Our goals consist in invigorating and inspiring the minds of a community of STEM aficionados on Steem, targeting on the long-term the upgrade of SteemSTEM as a real platform for science communication. In the meantime, this goes through the support of quality, interesting and cutting-edge STEM content. For more details, a recent update on the SteemSTEM project is available here. If you want to discuss with us, please do not hesitate to join the steemSTEM discord server. In order to support the best STEM content on Steem, our team scours the blockchain and read more than a couple of thousands of STEM-related posts per week. We hence support about 200 of these posts, and present in this distilled our top 8 handpicked choices for the last Thursday-Sunday period. ## Monday - Wednesday ___ ### The wave-particle duality of photons - physics explained This (delayed) week begins with an excellent physics post by @zen-art on the dual nature of light. You will surely learn a lot by her, so don’t skip this post, it might be long, but it is also very interesting! ### POSITIVE SPARK IN TRADITIONAL MEDICINE Let’s leave physics and move on to medicine and @yhubi who explains very well how blood tonic works. Were you among the ones who believed it actually produces more blood in your body? Well, you’d better read this post and you’ll be in for a surprise! Wednesday - Friday ### A world with no males - reality is stranger than fiction. What would a world without males be like? How would reproduction take place without having any boys around? @carlgnash has written a great post discussing just that… parthenogenesis! Don’t miss this one! ### [Math Talk #4] Pigeonhole Principle and Applications [2] Math lovers are you here? ‘Cause we got an amazing math post by @mathsolver just for you! This is the second part of the Pigeon Hole Principle (yeah, it would be great if you could read the previous part too). We can’t wait for more of his great math posts to come! Saturday - Sunday ### Animalistiary #6; Sex? Yes, They Almost Always Said Yes To Sex! @chloroform’s cool post comes next! You will love reading this piece on animals and their sexual behavior! Just don’t feel bad if some of them seem to have sex more often than you. ### Engineering Slut || How Bernoulli’s equations could solve engineering problems The engineering slut, ah sorry, @kafilat is closing our week this time with a wonderful engineering post and applications of Bernoulli’s equations. If you are into such subjects, then you will not regret reading this post! A few words about the nomination process For some time, the editorial team behind this distilled series is made of a one-woman-team, @ruth-girl, and she chooses her favorite posts (potentially discussing with other curators and/or the management). Posts written by the SteemSTEM team are excluded from the nomination process. Please do not be discouraged if you did not make it on this issue. We are picking up in total 14 posts a week out of more than 200. The chances are thus low ;) In the meantime, you may wish to check these guidelines for extra tips on how your writing could be more effective. Authors upvoted by the SteemSTEM team In the spirit of being transparent about our actions that are now supported by @utopian-io, @curie, our delegators, our trailers and our manual curator supporters, we release every week the list of authors who have caught the attention of the @steemstem curation team. Once again there will be no stats this week as everyone is on vacation or otherwise AWOL, including our resident stat mammouth (sp), @lemouth.

[Credits: @hightouch] As you probably all know by now, our stat-guru-mammouth has triumphantly returned! That meas it is time to get some fresh information on how SteemSTEM curation is going. Even though the summer time may be depressing in terms of the post flow, there are still very good authors around, who deserve strong support from our initiative. Please check our latest distilled for more detailed information on them. In this post, we will instead provide numbers on how we are doing. But before moving further, here is a quick reminder about the SteemSTEM curation guidelines. Curation with SteemSTEM Our curation team searches for original and quality content posted on Steem and related to all fields of science, technology, mathematics and engineering (STEM) in six languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian and Serbian). Although the usage of the #steemstem tag is recommended, it is of course not mandatory. It depends whether authors want to make our lives easier, and themselves more visible to us! After having found a post, a curator decides on the voting strength it should receive (small, medium, standard or high). Currently, small posts are voted with 5% strength, medium posts with 20% strength, standard posts with 65% strength and high posts with the full might and fury of our vote and trail votes, the 100% level. Our definitions of the different levels are simple: Small: encouragement, motivation, etc. Medium: informative post on some topic. Standard: good post that goes beyond providing information about a given topic. This could mean an interesting and unusual format, more information than what could be found elsewhere, etc. High: excellent posts, discussing the state-of-the-art of a given field, bringing something to the platform that cannot be found elsewhere. Anything larger than small requires double curation, and we insist on the fact that getting higher support means bringing something to Steem that cannot be found anywhere else. This could for instance be an article about cutting-edge science not discussed anywhere else, or a novel and/or non-standard way of presenting a topic. In other words, science communication is pushed forward! In parallel, we try to be as generous as possible with the small and medium votes and use them as a mean to both promote informative content and make it more visible, as well as to nurture and incentivise the growth of our up and coming blogging talent. Furthermore, a single person cannot get more than 3% of all steemSTEM votes cast during the previous 2 weeks. Note that curators receive guaranteed 70% upvotes for their STEM posts (as they are not entitled for curie votes), however they too must abide by the same 3% rule that all other posters do. Finally, the juicy section you have all been waiting for… Statistics Since the beginning of our partnership with curie on September 13th, 2017, we have upvoted almost 11.000 posts written by about 1550 unique authors. The detailed weekly statistics are given below, in terms of number of supported posts, authors and the fraction of used weekly available voting power. As can be observed, even in this dark times (in terms of post flow), we still do pretty good. Thank you all for bringing your contributions in building this community.

Are you excited? We sure are! With so many awesome and interesting people attending, we decided to give you a short introduction to some of the (less shy) attendees of the Utopian.io mini-hackathon. Remember, you don’t have to attend physically to join the hackathon! Read more about it here. Utopian.io CEO - @elearIt would be odd to start this list with anyone other than our fearless leader and visionary - Diego Pucci, known as @elear on Steem. A young Italian actor turned entrepreneur gathers a team of like-minded open source contributors to revolutionize the open source economy. It almost sounds like the script of a Hollywood film, but that’s the dramatized version of the story. In reality, @elear has come a long way from the world of performing arts to reinventing the economic model that drives open source innovation. Holding various positions from IT Manager to developer in various startups and global enterprises, Diego has built a strong career with 11 years of experience in managing innovative web-based projects. I don’t consider myself a social person, so when I spend time with people, I choose those I can learn from and those with whom I share or challenge a vision. To me, that is what this meetup is about, sharing, learning, building together. Drinks are also appreciated. As the CEO, Diego is involved in everything and anything happening in Utopian.io. From speaking to contributors on Discord to meeting with potential investors and collaborating with open source ventures and projects - @elear has been living and breathing Utopian.io for over nine months now, and aims to continue to do so. Utopian.io COO - @espoemThe Chief Operations Officer on Utopian.io is the one and only @espoem - Martin. Loved by everyone on the team, the shy 24-year-old Czech is the one who makes sure things get done in all the departments and on all the teams. His passion for learning and improving, along with his professionalism, make him the perfect man for his job. I believed for a long time that I could keep a space between myself and anyone else. Fortunately, being with amazing people showed me that it would only hold me back if I tried to avoid them. I am looking forward to meeting everyone in person, without the need to make long distance calls. You may find me in a corner, fading out. But I’ll be there, excited to be with you. Unfortunately, his dedication to his work means we don’t know him quite as well as we’d like. This meetup is surely an opportunity to finally learn more about the man (and the legend). In the meantime, you can read the interview with @espoem on People of Utopian. Utopian.io CMO - @techslutShe fears numbers, loves to write and be silly, and seems to be everywhere all the time (with a cup of coffee in hand). Our Chief Marketing Officer, Ilana Brudo, is known as @techslut on Steem and brings to Utopian.io over a decade of experience in technology journalism, marketing, blogging and advertising. Behind the giggly pink facade is a serious and ambitious businesswoman, dreaming of seeing herself beside @elear and @espoem on the cover of Forbes Magazine. I’ve missed Italy ever since I first visited it when I was only 18. A chance to visit this amazing country again and meet some of the brightest minds and most inspiring people on the Steem blockchain is nothing short of a life-changing opportunity. If I were any more excited, I would be bouncing off the walls. In addition to her role as CMO and co-host of the Utopian.io Open Source Radio Show on MSP-Waves, Ilana is also the Community Manager for the Visibility category, helping project owners promote their projects with the help of a community of contributors with experience with advertising and promotion. A woman of words, she is an invaluable part of the Utopian.io puzzle, helping us reach more people and clearly communicate our vision and goals. You can read more about Ilana in her interview on People of Utopian.

SteemSTEM Community Relations Manager - @suesaShe started out with fiction stories that had just enough science to get her noticed by SteemSTEM, of which she then quickly became a part of the management team. After the first steemSTEM meetup at CERN, @suesa was excited for setting up another one, and started planning the meetup at Virgo Labs with @bendelgreco. The German woman loves to socialize with Steemians and can often be found on steem.chat or lurking in random comment sections. @suesa supervises the steemSTEM honor member crew, which are an integral part of the steemSTEM community, as they are mentoring members, fostering engagement, checking for plagiarism, and helping out with whatever problems new steemSTEM authors might face. She’s also really looking forward to the food in Italy. If you ask her in private, that might be one of the main reasons for having the meetup there. SteemSTEM Co-Founder - @lemouthProfessor of physics at Sorbonne University in Paris, @lemouth is a theoretical particle physicist who is in addition one of the few theory members of the CMS collaboration of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. His research spans varied topics including precision computations in quantum chromodynamics, beyond the Standard Model phenomenology, LHC and future particle collider physics, dark matter and the development of high-energy physics computing tools. He is currently running state-of-the-art particle physics research on Steem, in partnership with utopian.io and programmers from Steem. Shortly after having joined Steem more than two years ago, @lemouth founded SteemSTEM with @justtryme90 in order to increase both the quality as well as the visibility of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) posts on Steem. Today, the direction aimed by SteemSTEM is much broader. As will be officially announced tomorrow (hehe), we are marching towards SteemSTEM’s grand goal of building a scientific communication medium running on Steem. We indeed believe Steem has a significant role to play, through SteemSTEM, for improving and ameliorating science communication worldwide! Buildteam CTO - @reggaemuffinComputer science student and entrepreneur @reggaemuffin joined Steem more than one year ago and immediately saw the potential of the platform. He developed multiple automation services and initiatives, most notably @minnowbooster, and quickly became a witness to support the blockchain. Together with @thecryptodrive and @cryptomancer he founded @buildteam, a blockchain innovation company that is currently spearheading many projects with the goal to make Steem a better place. He is supporting the SteemSTEM project in every way he can and believes that science communication is one of the things that will make Steem flourish and bring positive change to the world. As a witness he is always helping users understand the technical aspects of Steem. Metting everyone in Florence will be the highlight of the trip. Meeting all the utopians like @techslut and @helo and finally putting faces to their online identities is something he is very much looking forward to. That and food!

As such we are especially pleased to update you, our vibrant community, about the status of all on-going SteemSTEM activities and actions during this time. For the past several months, SteemSTEM has been marching towards its grand goal of building a novel science communication medium running on the Steem blockchain. We all recognize that science communication is a vital force worldwide and we believe Steem has a significant role to play in this space, through SteemSTEM. Several decisions have been made to assist this in becoming a reality, and here we will describe each in full. Briefly, we are finalizing the development of a stand alone SteemSTEM app, SteemSTEM has now become fully active on other social media platforms and our curation guidelines have been updated in order to more effectively attract science bloggers and research institute press offices to Steem. Finally, in continuing our trend of holding meetups in crazy (sciency) places, we are looking forward to a successful up-coming meetup at Virgo Labs. The SteemSTEM App In order to increase the visibility of high quality posts in any of the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) topics, nothing will allow us to be more effective than a custom-tailored user interface. The first beta version of our application should be released within about 10-15 days, and on this SteemSTEM platform, only posts supported by SteemSTEM curators along with those of white-listed high quality content creating authors, will be visible. This content selectivity will ensure we are able to present the world with a level of STEM quality in order to effectively attract: - Any potential investor who sees the value in monitization incentives (Steem) as an aid in effective science communicating. - Any top-notch science blogger and field expert who would enjoy the unique support of their work that only Steem can provide. - Any individual interested in learning/reading about fascinating, fact based, cutting edge STEM content. With such an app at hand, we will be able to start touring research institute press offices from all over the world to bring them to Steem, showing them the varied advantages of using Steem as a tool for spreading news about what their research groups are doing. By making state-of-the-art research communications available on Steem, we will set the precedent of the Steem blockchain as a primary source of scientific information. We hence aim to offer a space where both STEM professionals and passionate bloggers can freely distribute their knowledge in a social media environment that actively promotes and rewards them. With one long-term goal being to incentivise the direct communication between experts and interested viewers; helping to reduce the number of inaccuracies in reporting of STEM content, generated by journalists’ interpretations of data that are so prevalent today. SteemSTEM on other social media We have recently created SteemSTEM accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, so that we have a way to provide updates about all new trending articles according to our standards and our actions to the outside world (i.e. anything lying outside the Steem ecosystem). We believe that anything shared on Steem should not stay on Steem. Science communication is vital and information should be spread on a wider level, across the borders of Steem. By expanding SteemSTEM beyond the frontiers of the Steem blockchain, we provide incentives for STEM experts and bloggers to communicate their work to the mainstream audiences both on a platform that rewards them, and through other mainstream media as a bonus. Curation and honor members Our curation team decides on the voting strength a post should receive amongst four levels: small (encouragement and motivation), medium (informative post), standard (post that goes beyond providing information about a given topic), high (discussion of state-of-the-art research, or something that cannot be found elsewhere). Such rules allow us to provide our strongest support to universities, research institutes and STEM professionals on Steem who are the ones providing information that cannot necessarily be found elsewhere. In addition, STEM aficionados also get supported to a good extent when sharing their passion. We have moreover set up a team of motivated and engaged honor members providing help and guidance for writing interesting and well-referenced STEM posts respecting copyrights. They furthermore motivate each member of the community to engage with each other, handle complaints and questions and help to track scammers and plagiarists. Implication on Steem As SteemSTEM runs on Steem, it is important to also work to support the Steem blockchain, without which none of our goals would be achievable. To this aim, we are currently setting up a SteemSTEM witness and planning to deploy an RPC full node. We will provide more information when we will be ready and when the server setup will be finalized, in the upcoming weeks. Meet us in Italy, at Virgo Labs To finish this status update post, let us remind that about 30 people will visit Virgo Labs in 3 weeks time. This research institute is one of the few places in the world tracking and detecting gravitational waves. After having organized our first meetup inside the LHC, we naturally moved to another place important for science: a laboratory connected to the 2017 Nobel Prize in physics. We are looking forward to this meetup, organized with our friends from Utopian.io. News, stories and pictures will be shared with those unfortunately not attending. If you want to help us with the meetup organization, please do not hesitate to support us through our fundition campaign. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6jLMgHm6PM [ Video credits: @gtg ] See you all next Monday for the next SteemSTEM distilled!

Slightly more than one week is left on the calendar and we’ll finally meet each other in the beautiful city of Florence. Before (or actually during) this exciting event we will publish some exclusive interviews with real researchers and engineers working at the Virgo Experiment. ### Even if you did not get the chance to attend the meetup this time, we would love to ask questions on your behalf! ## Who are we going to interview? The two scientists who agreed to be contacted are Giovanni Losurdo and Alessio Rocchi. Giovanni Losurdo was the project leader of the detector upgrade phase which lasted about 5 years (2011-2016). Since 2005 he coordinated all R&amp;D within the Virgo Collaboration, the preparation of the Advanced Virgo Conceptual Design and of the Project Execution Plan and Cost Plan, the activity of the Advanced Virgo subsystem manager and the preparation of the Advanced Virgo Technical Design. Since 2003 he dealt with the commissioning of the full Virgo detector and has been coordinator of the MSC (Mirror Suspension Control) Group. In the 1992‐2000, he gave a major contribution to the design, realization and test of the Superattenuator, the unique vibration isolation system for the Virgo mirrors. Alessio Rocchi is an experimental physicist in the field of gravitational waves since 1997. At the beginning of his career, he worked on cryogenic resonant bar detectors (NAUTILUS at INFN Frascati National Laboratories, EXPLORER at CERN, and MINIGRAIL at Leiden University) at the development of quantum limited superconducting electronics. In 2007, he joined Virgo and became the responsible for the installation of the adaptive optic system (named TCS) for the correction of the aberrations in the interferometer’s mirrors. Lately, in the framework of the Advanced Virgo Project, he has been in charge of the design and construction of the upgraded TCS. In February 2017, he was appointed Commissioning Coordinator, with the mandate to lead the experimental activities on site in view of the joint science runs with LIGO. What can you ask? Everything concerning Virgo, the collaboration with LIGO, gravitational waves, black holes, noise detection, data analysis, etc. Anything you may want to. Physicists are generally very happy to answer every single question! In practice, it is enough to write down in the comment section your questions. We will ask them next week to the people behind one of the most exciting experiments on Earth! To conclude As the meetup is approaching, this may be one of the last chances to support us by contributing to the expenses generated by moving 30 people from all over the world to Italy. Every upvote counts, and we would appreciate yours.

SteemSTEM aims to make Steem a better place for STEM, a task which we believe crucial for the long-term development of the blockchain. Our goals consist in invigorating and inspiring the minds of a community of STEM aficionados on Steem, targeting on the long-term the upgrade of SteemSTEM as a real platform for science communication. In the meantime, this goes through the support of quality, interesting and cutting-edge STEM content. For more details, a recent update on the SteemSTEM project is available here. If you want to discuss with us, please do not hesitate to join the steemSTEM discord server. In order to support the best STEM content on Steem, our team scours the blockchain and read more than a couple of thousands of STEM-related posts per week. We hence support about 200 of these posts, and present in this distilled our top 8 handpicked choices for the last Thursday-Sunday period. ## Monday - Wednesday ___ ### Let’s talk about the scale of measurement for stellar luminosity and different types of variable stars Some astronomy for starters this week? @rifkan has written a cool post on how to measure star luminosity. You will definitely like this one and learn that stars can also be “variables” just not only when you’re dealing with math equations… ### Journey from adaptive immunity in bacteria(CRISPR) to saving Man’s best friend(Dog). An excellent post by @scienceblocks (not that we are used to anything less when we see that name on our feed) discusses the advances in CRISPR and how scientists have recently come to saving the man’s best friend by “fixing” its faulty genes. Wednesday - Friday ### “Cry me a river” - from biology to psychology of tears Don’t worry, we are not going to make you cry after reading @zen-art’s incredible post. You will just learn more about both the “body” and the “soul” science of tears. ### GMO food isn’t going to make your food allergies worse, but could make them better. GMO food and how it could help you battle annoying allergies is the topic in @effofex’s post. Don’t miss reading this amazing piece that will make you think twice about the effectiveness of GMOs. Saturday - Sunday ### Maxwell’s Zombie: Duncan’s Perpetual Machine @anevolvedmonkey and physics are next. Read another great post we picked for you and see what our author has to explain to us about the second law of thermodynamics. ### On the origin of life And our week closes with @tychoxi and an excellent post that discusses how life rose in the planet. You will definitely appreciate this well-written and detailed piece! A few words about the nomination process For some time, the editorial team behind this distilled series is made of a one-woman-team, @ruth-girl, and she chooses her favorite posts (potentially discussing with other curators and/or the management). Posts written by the SteemSTEM team are excluded from the nomination process. Please do not be discouraged if you did not make it on this issue. We are picking up in total 6 posts a week out of more than 150-200. The chances are thus low ;) In the meantime, you may wish to check these guidelines for extra tips on how your writing could be more effective. Authors upvoted by the SteemSTEM team In the spirit of being transparent about our actions that are now supported by @utopian-io, @curie, our delegators, our trailers and our manual curator supporters, we release every week the list of authors who have caught the attention of the @steemstem curation team. From August 26 to September 2, we rewarded 113 different authors who have written a total of 162 different articles.

Between suitcases and travel plans, we’re happy to continue acquainting you with the (less shy) Utopian.io Hackathon Attendees. In our previous post about the Utopian.io hackathon participants, we introduced the Utopian.io core team: @elear, @espoem and @techslut. In this post, we’ve caught up with @amosbastian, @jestemkioskiem and @jedigeiss. Want to participate in the Utopian.io hackathon? You can still join! Read more about it here. Development Category Community Manager - @amosbastianThis 24-year-old man of the world, currently living in Lisbon, is a gifted developer with a passion for football, beer, gaming and code. Merciless in his reviews, Amos oversees one of the most important categories on Utopian.io - development. I don’t really have any specific plans for things to do at the meetup yet. I’m the kind of person who enjoys going with the flow and seeing what happens. I will probably participate in the hackathon or something like that. Most of all, I am looking forward to meeting everyone in person. I think that will be weird at first, but should definitely be a lot of fun! Other than that, I’m also pretty interested in going to VIRGO, even though I have absolutely no knowledge on what they actually do there. I’ve been to Italy once before when I was 16 on a school trip… had my worst hangover of all time (this happens when you don’t know your limit). Ever since, I get sick if I even smell Sambuca. I’m not planning on something similar happening again! Want to get to know our Development CM better? You can read the interview with @amosbastian on People of Utopian. Utopian.io Open Source Radio Show Host - @jedigeissDon’t let his age or job (banking industry) confuse you - Jan is a fun-loving German musician and open source enthusiast that likes to get silly and joke around. You should know this if you’re a listener of the Utopian.io Open Source Radio show. A computer scientist at heart and by profession, he has been managing IT projects in the banking sector for over a decade, always honing his skills in programming languages. I am really looking forward to meeting all the people of SteemStem and Utopian.io. I have always been an outsider in my own profession. I really enjoy getting to know new folks and talking to strangers, I guess this is also why I love hosting the Utopian Open Source Radio Show :) I hope the pool is still open in September because I definitely will jump in there! There are a lot of things I plan to do at the Meetup. For one, we are having our first live radio show where we’re all in one location. In other words, @techslut and myself will be in the same room, whatever the consequences may be :) On the other hand side I would really love to take part in the hackathon as a python coder. Coffee machines, Calculators or Artificial Intelligence, I will give my best in making it work. Bug Hunting Category Community Manager - @jestemkioskiemOur co-CM of the Bug Hunting category, @jestemkioskiem (Victor), is a young programming student from Poland who does a lot more behind the scenes in Utopian than you might think. When he’s not correcting the grammar in translations and contribution posts, he’s learning new things and applying his skills to create new and useful tools for Utopian moderators and users. I haven’t really thought much about what exactly I’ll be doing there. The meetup is a way for me to meet the team members, get to know them more and see for myself how we can operate in a local setting where we don’t need to wait for anyone to respond. I’ve never been to Italy, so obviously seeing it will be a bit of a vacation for me as well. I’ve never boarded a plane, so that’s fun (not really, I am paranoid about messing up)! I am hoping to see how our developers work during the hackathon to get important experience in the field. I hope to land my first job in programming next year. All in all, I am very excited for this trip and I can’t wait to see how it unfolds! If you want to know more about @jestemkioskiem, check out his interview on People of Utopian. Almost there!With the Fundition campaign coming to summation, we’d like to thank every one of the participants, supporters and contributors. This meetup could not have been funded without the support of @fundition and the many users to contribute funds and upvotes. The next update will include a summary of the campaign, and we invite you to keep following @utopian-io and @steemstem for live updates from the meetup and hackathon.

They have been an active part of the larger steemSTEM community for seven months and have shown great growth and development in the promotion of STEM content on the blockchain. The beginningThe reason for the creation of stem-espanol was to promote scientific publications in Spanish. @carloserp-2000 came up with this idea at the end of last year hand in hand with @iamphysical and weeks of planning together with the directive of @steemstem, this project was born on January 12th of this year, acceptance was immediate and many users of the Spanish-speaking community decided to join the main channel in discord and show their support for this wonderful project that, together with their excellent publications, has played a role in the growth of this sub-community. Community BuildingSince its creation, the administrators of #stem-espanol have worked tirelessly in search of the consolidation of this project, which together with the management of #steemstem and the support provided have made this sub-community one of the best known on the STEEM blockchain. It is not just about looking for high quality scientific content written in Spanish, but about creating activities and encouraging community members to feel comfortable being part of #stem-espanol. Because the community grew very quickly and we planned to do different activities, we met at the beginning of April to create the main server of the STEM-Espanol discord. Its purpose is for users to feel comfortable interacting, and also contains several chat channels from different areas of Science, where everyone can discuss their common interests; in addition there are specific channels for suggestions and questions about the STEM community. It also has an intelligent Bot that not only greets new users, but also performs important tasks within the server, such as “answering” some questions related to the project; above all the bot serves as a great help and guidance for those new users who are dabbling in the community. One of the most important community activities that exists is the one that takes place every Thursday of each week called “Virtual Conversation”,where an active user of the community has the opportunity to share a topic related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. This has been a big success! The dynamics is simple, each user must connect to the voice channel and listen to the speaker talk about the topic chosen by him and listeners can make their questions in writing in the conversation channel. STEM-Espanol has a group of people specialized in each scientific area, this group is called “Area Collaborator”, and they are in charge of guiding, informing, attending and clarifying any questions that a user may have concerning the community. They manage each area sub-channel and share ideas with the other users of the server. Their help is paramount for the managers of @stem-espanol. Account @stem-espanolSince mid-June, our sub-community independently manages its own account on Steem with the username @stem-espanol. As of its creation, this account has been used to publish a detailed report on the curation process of each week, showing the statistics of the users supported by #steemstem and the Podium of the 3 best publications of the week, it should be noted that the Podium is chosen by the users of the active community of # stem-espanol where they freely vote through a survey page the publication of their preference. There is also an article with an audiovisual report, created by one of the collaborators of #stem-espanol, where a summary of the Podium of the week is shown. In the same way each relevant publication is resteemed by the account @ stem-espanol. If the publications meet the criteria of #steemSTEM, they will be sent to the steemSTEM curation team. Once reviewed, they will receive our generous vote to support the diffusion of knowledge and dedication to show content of current scientific-technological interest and quality. Trail stem-espanolAs part of the growth and innovation plan of our community, a few days ago the official trail of @stem-espanol was created through steemauto. Any user can join the trail and will be supporting the healing process, since they will vote for those items that @stem-espanol vote, which also has added value, that you will get healing rewards completely automatically. Our future plans.We always try to innovate, since our project tries to copy itself, but they can never match it, so we are in a stage of selecting the logo of each STEM area, we have planned to make a presentation of each user in an article called About @usuario and set a day for the pleasant discussion of various topics, ie; an “Afternoon coffee and something more”. The idea is to encourage the participation of new users who write in Spanish and to contribute their scientific knowledge for the consolidation of our community #stem-espanol. In the same way there is the possibility of a meetup with the active members of the community. This meeting is being planned but we still do not have a date - stay tuned for more information! ¿Qué esperas?, forma parte de nosotros!¿Tienes conocimientos científicos?, ¿hablas español?, te gusta leer, escribir e interactuar, entonces no esperes más y únete a nuestro canal en discord y de seguro nuestros amigos te atenderán cordialmente. ¡Hasta pronto!

It is with great pleasure that I finally announce the arrival of the SteemSTEM badges! You will probably see some of these on pictures during the on-going meetup :) These luminous badges bearing the SteemSTEM logo were created by myself, @robotics101, following direction from @zest, so that you can proudly display your love for SteemSTEM at your next events! I hope you will like them :) # Context: At the beginning of June and I had set myself the objective of learning how to create printed circuit board (PCB) before the end of the summer, so that I could use this skill in my next projects. After creating some PCBs by following various tutorials on the Web, I started looking for a first project that would allow me to test what I just learned. I was looking for a project that was not too complex but useful (since I have to order many units when I have the printed circuits manufactured). So I decided to create a hardware badge based on the SteemSTEM logo, inspired by the hardware badges used by various conferences and events (DEFCON, MakerFaire, etc.). After receiving the prototypes of the first version we were able to make some adjustments to improve the badge as the iterations progressed. The one shown on the photo at the beginning of the article is part of the second batch of badges. We will talk, in a follow-up article on my blog about the details behind the design and manufacturing part of the badge. For now, we will instead focus on the different models and how you can get them! # How to get yours? For this first series, I have a limited number of badges, so there will be only a few on sale that you can buy with SBD or STEEM. Here is the available stock: - 6 badges in multi-color (see this video); - 6 single-color badges in green, blue, white, red or yellow (see below). Once we are out of stock, you will be notified in the comments of this article and I will send you a message when they will be available again. To order yours, simply complete this form and send the correct number of STEEM or SBD to my account, @robotics101, according to these rules: - 8.5 STEEM / 7 SBD per badge (6 STEEM / 5 SBD if you want to solder it yourself); - 2.5 STEEM / 2 SBD per order for delivery. For example, if you want to order 2 of them, this gives: 2x7+2 = 16 SBD. # Do you want a personalized ones? If you would like to have similar badges for your community, feel free to contact me on discord ( @Tristan#195) or by mail ( contact (at) 101robotics (dot) com) !

SteemSTEM aims to make Steem a better place for STEM, a task which we believe crucial for the long-term development of the blockchain. Our goals consist in invigorating and inspiring the minds of a community of STEM aficionados on Steem, targeting on the long-term the upgrade of SteemSTEM as a real platform for science communication. In the meantime, this goes through the support of quality, interesting and cutting-edge STEM content. For more details, a recent update on the SteemSTEM project is available here. If you want to discuss with us, please do not hesitate to join the steemSTEM discord server. In order to support the best STEM content on Steem, our team scours the blockchain and read more than a couple of thousands of STEM-related posts per week. We hence support about 200 of these posts, and present in this distilled our top 8 handpicked choices for the last Thursday-Sunday period. ## Monday - Wednesday ___ ### Exploring Hallucination #2; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning And Seeing Ghosts Paranormal or perfectly normal? Begin your week by reading this great post by @conficker and find out how ghost sightings can be explained through the very logical scope of science. ### Wendigo; The History Of A Vicious Man-Eating Spirit @chloroform continues his journey in the world of cannibalism and gives us an excellent read. The key-word here is “Wendigo”. A spirit? A psychosis? What is this dark force that makes certain people put human meat on their menu? Wednesday - Friday ### Artificial intelligence for Dummies: It’s All In The Game (Part 4) And let’s move on to something totally different. @nikolanikola and his very interesting series on artificial intelligence are here to explain all about games and what a robot does while playing. Read this one, you’re gonna love it! ### Oncology Xenograft Models: Using mice to test cancer treatments A great author, who doesn’t post very often, is here again with a fantastic piece. @tking77798 tells us what an oncology xenograft model is and how it works in cancer treatment research. Why do we sacrifice lab mice in our quest for a successful cancer treatment? You’ll need to read on to learn more. Saturday - Sunday ### Vacations &amp; Your Mental Health And let’s see what the weekend brought us, @insight-out and a great psychology post on vacations and their importance on our mental health and well-being. Don’t miss this one! ### INTUITION - What happens beyond the discursive use of the mind? Are you ready to leave? Not just yet as @erh.germany and her detailed and well-written post on intuition has some amazing facts to share. You’re certainly intrigued by the title already, so don’t delay, click on that link and start reading! A few words about the nomination process For some time, the editorial team behind this distilled series is made of a one-woman-team, @ruth-girl, and she chooses her favorite posts (potentially discussing with other curators and/or the management). Posts written by the SteemSTEM team are excluded from the nomination process. Please do not be discouraged if you did not make it on this issue. We are picking up in total 6 posts a week out of more than 150-200. The chances are thus low ;) In the meantime, you may wish to check these guidelines for extra tips on how your writing could be more effective.

We are also running a broadcast node (with the same server specifications as described for stem.witness) to assist others who would like to have access to the blockchain. Please have a look to 159.69.58.17. [OK, maybe in a few hours as we are currently replaying, after the upgrade to 0.20.5 earlier this morning.] ## Why Is SteemSTEM Running A Witness and a Node? We have been and continue to be dedicated to growing a community of STEM posters and supporting the creation of high quality STEM content on the Steem blockchain. Our plans include the upcoming - very soon ;) - release of the official SteemSTEM app enabling us to grow our userbase to new heights. With this app in hand, we hope to reach research institutes from all over the world and bring them on Steem as primary sources of scientific information on the Web. In other words, we aim to utilize the Steem blockchain as a STEM communication medium. The success of the SteemSTEM project is deeply linked with the success of Steem as a whole and as such we wish to do our part in maintaining the security of the blockchain as well as to continue to show our dedication to Steem. With the issues that have been on-going with the HF20 transition, we have also thought about the way in which we could help better. And it is all about testing. Being a community of several hundreds of active Steemians, our best option is incontrovertibly to make use of this size to participate in the testnet efforts, trying to assess how a relatively large number of users could make Steem behave. # How To Vote To vote for the SteemSTEM witness, please go to https://steemit.com/~witnesses and type stem.witness into the box at the very bottom of the page: We thank you for your support and continue to thank each of you for the opportunity you all provide us to grow and develop a STEM community with the potential to change the very nature by which cutting edge information is shared on the Internet.

For a long time, steemSTEM has been on a path of growth. Once a small group of friends curating on the old Steem chat, we are now a thriving community spread all around the world and one of the most trusted teams on the Steem blockchain. With our ambitions set high, we have grown to include our trusted curators and honor members, allowing the management team to take SteemSTEM another step forward. The road has been long, but we are here now to present you with our brand new, dedicated-to-STEM Steem App: steemstem.io. SteemSTEM began under the premise that somebody needed to clear out the science feeds on Steem. However, we started to realise that there was a niche that needed filling around the world: Science communication, without the middlemen. A direct line from dedicated scientists or passionate bloggers, to you - one in which standard blogging sites are unequipped to support. What is steemstem.io for?Though the open nature of the Steem blockchain offers many advantages to society, it can, in and of itself, be a hindrance to the nature of STEM subjects when one individual can have equal or more authority than any other based on their personal stake. This automatically allows misinformation to spread unhindered alongside legitimate reports, and it becomes impossible to distinguish which is which. But the scientific method is one of the greatest tools humans have at their disposal, and its that innately skeptical nature and the rigorous self-righting mechanisms that we apply to information available on Steem; in our App, only posts approved by our team of curators will be featured. However, as we still value censorship resistance built into the Steem blockchain, there is an option to show all posts under the related tags allowing all STEM, supported by us or not, to be visible: Quality ControlSteemstem.io also comes with a significant feature that has long been built into the SteemSTEM ecosystem. We, as a curation initiative, operate with three layers of review and scrutiny: 1) An experienced curator reads and verifies if a post is legitimate, searches for plagiarism and decides on the value of the post according to set parameters. 2) A second curator then double checks before the vote can go through. 3) Our fantastic team of honor members, as well as the public at large, can view our voting history, and act as a final barrier of legitimacy. Should they find something we missed, they can submit for vote removal and the user to be blacklisted, with evidence provided. All these functions exist alongside the App to ensure that the most original and validated content is promoted, without the risk of any biased third party cutting in line. The result is a reliable, high-quality space for academics and enthusiasts alike to communicate all the discoveries of the Universe on Steem and to be rewarded for their efforts. Be Promoted on steemstem.ioAs you may have noticed, there is a header bar with 7 slots for posts on steemstem.io. This consists in 7 place holders for posts to be promoted. The way to get there is easy: Write an excellent post following SteemSTEM guidelines. After getting a @steemstem upvote, send a 3 STEEM/day promotion fee to @steemstem-io, with the link as a memo. This will book one of these place holders for the relevant amount of days. Note that the fee can vary (please verify on the @steemstem-io profile). Reimbursements are possible only (and only) if there is no place holder left. We hope this could get you some extra exposure, especially when steemstem.io will become one of the most visited places on the Internet. Main features of steemstem.ioSteemstem.io comes with other features. On the front page, you’ll find a permanent space for whitelisted users; well-known, trusted and high quality authors recognized for their hard work. We could not have grown to what we are today without the growth of an international community. To date, we have self-sufficient communities working in 5 languages, all of which are available filters on our App: English, French, German, Italian and Spanish, with more to come! This allows each of our foreign language communities to have their own unique, hand picked trending sections, subdivided by topic, allowing for better recruitment of STEM experts and enthusiasts who don’t feel as enthusiastic about English to share their knowledge and improve science literacy around the world. Steemstem.io can do everything you expect a front-end on STEEM should do. Users can login via SteemConnect, vote, comment, follow, resteem &amp; share to other social media. Users can also manage their wallet contents as well as send and receive STEEM, power up/power down etc… You can see suggested posts and recent activity of users as well as their wallet history and more. The Future?We will continue developing our App, having in mind the following main items: - A SteemSTEM Store. The store will hold all manner of related merchandise, including Hand-made LED badges, hoodies &amp; t-shirts, books and compilations from popular authors and more. - The introduction of a SteemSTEM reputation mechanism - Delegator/Investor rewards (our supporters should get a ROI.) - Guest comments without the need of an account on Steem. For now, feel free to explore the app, join us on discord and become a part of a growing Steem community - There’s so much more to come!

It was a very busy week, following the return of an interesting/exciting/long-awaited meetup in Italy and the news is a-plenty! In an effort to bring the community closer together and with our goal to keep you updated, we are commencing a weekly news blog for everything that was announced or launched the previous days, so let’s not waste any more time! ### SteemSTEM &amp; Utopian.io Meetup Yes, this happened more than 2 weeks ago, but it is worth a special mention! For those who might not know, SteemSTEM and Utopian.io went to Italy recently, where they got the amazing opportunity to visit Virgo Labs and to meet world-renowned scientists! (Virgo Labs is a laboratory where gravitational wave research is conducted) In addition to the meetup, a hackathon was organized by @utopian-io! As a bonus to the trip, everyone got to visit famous landmarks in Italy (and abused delicious Italian cuisine of course!) A more hands-on approach to Virgo Labs and EGO (European Gravitational Observatory) can be found here with even more supporting explanations in another post, written prior to the visit. If you wish to see the most ‘tasty’ side of the trip, make sure to read @suesa’s recap. Here is another community aspect detailed by @alexdory, and please make sure to check out the posts by @techslut (here), @fredrikaa (there), @sco (here) and @egotheist who sees weird people (right there). —– ### Upcoming Reputation System Amidst the ‘reputation hype’ of the last few weeks comes a different approach for an alternative reputation system: A reputation system that will include two main components contributing equally in the results. One concerns authorship and the other one engagement. @lemouth describes everything in detail in this article that could be the seed of a future SteemSTEM reputation. You will also have the chance to see a list of the top 30 most reputed SteemSTEM authors of all time (out of 2662 authors), and top 30 most engaged community members (out of 23134 people). ##### Are you in? — ### Badges are out Some of you have created steemstem t-shirts, while some of you have created steemstem cups to have your coffee in. As the steemstem shop is in the process of being finalized, @robotics101 took the time (following direction from @zest) to create printed circuit boards and thus got the idea to create hardware SteemSTEM badges! Check them out here and make sure to get yours (coming in multiple colors)! —- ### Steem Witness and Seed Node SteemSTEM has been quietly running a witness node (@stem.witness) for the past few weeks, and made their official announcement a few days ago! The steemSTEM witness runs on a Hetzner server and you can check out the specifications on the announcement link. If you ask yourselves why, the response is simple. SteemSTEM is dedicated to grow the STEM community on Steem and to continue supporting quality contents on the Steem blockchain. So, it comes as no surprise that contribution as a witness and a seed node will do their parts in maintaining the blockchain. Feel free to read more here and of course you can support this initiative by voting @stem.witness as your witness! To vote for the SteemSTEM witness, please go here and type stem.witness into the box at the very bottom of the page: —- ### SteemSTEM App is launched in Beta — Last, but certainly not the least, comes the long-awaited release of the steemSTEM App steemstem.io! (Beta) The steemstem.io App is designed with one goal in mind: Science communication, without the middlemen You can read here for the official announcement and feel free to visit the app and share your comments with us on discord or as comments to this post. You have already been very helpful in providing constructive feedback and we appreciate it! Bonus TipDid you know that you get a voting slider through steemstem.io even if your SP (Steem Power) is less than 500? This concludes our weekly news update, we hope you enjoyed it and learnt something new!

However, we did not stop there, as many steps remain until our grand goal of building a unique science communication ecosystem on the Steem blockchain is achieved. The next step in our expansion is to bring research institutes, researchers and well-known science bloggers to communicate research results and information directly on Steem, without the need to utlize any intermediate platform. In order to position Steem for playing such a significant role for science communication (through the SteemSTEM project), it is crucial that SteemSTEM becomes economically sustainable, allowing us to fund our next steps and continue expansion. ### A CALL FOR SUPPORTERS We are therefore making a call for supporters who would like to get into the SteemSTEM project by delegating a fraction of their shares, and who could hence contribute to render Steem a better home for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. As an incentive, SteemSTEM has begun sharing 65% (on average, when integrated over time) of its weekly curation rewards with all its benefactors, split proportionally to their invested/delegated STEEM. An extra 20% of the curation rewards is also split between the SteemSTEM managers, curators, PR team members and honor members for their work with the remaining 15% staying with @steemstem. The reward distribution and accounting will be transparently displayed and can be followed on @steemstem.pay. We plan to further expand these benefactor rewards in the future as additional revenue streams become available (through planned expansion/developments via steemstem.io). Make sure to follow us and watch out for even more updates to come!

You do your research and start writing, full of joy and creativity. After a while, your post is ready, awaiting publication. You do a thorough cross-check at the end, and make sure you use the tag #steemstem (as this will make it easier for the SteemSTEM team to track it). Then you probably wait for the first comments to come. How was your article perceived? Will what you wrote be of interest to your readers? Will it make a good impression to the curator(s) that will take a look and evaluate it according to the SteemSTEM standards? ## The Curators of SteemSTEM What do they do? Well, their tasks include searching for new STEM authors, evaluating and reviewing STEM articles, conducting thorough searches for plagiarism and they are the people who will suggest whether or not a STEM article has to be upvoted and supported by @steemstem. ### Let’s get to know the Curators better, shall we? A community gets bigger and stronger as its members work together, get to know each other, learn from each other. Evolve. Flourish. Who are the curators of SteemSTEM? How long are they going through the STEM posts? What makes a post unique according to them? Is their job easy? We are planning to interview the SteemSTEM curators with the goal and hope to inspire you and to shed more light about how the curation process works. In this post @ruth-girl is interviewed by @katerinaramm! You may know her from the editorial team of the SteemSTEM distilled. You most probably have wondered, laughed and learned something new, traveled, feared with her multi dimensional, educational, ficticious, creative posts! You surely have lots of questions for her and we have carefully picked a few to shed some more light into who @ruth-girl is! If you have any extra questions or thoughts, feel free to let someone from the PR team know! ## Let the curtain open! Q - Hi @ruth-girl, thank you for agreeing to be interviewed! Let us know a few things about yourself: What do you do, where are you from, how long have you been on Steem and what are your hobbies? A - Hello! It’s an honor and pleasure being here! Let’s start with the basics: I am from Greece! I have a degree in primary school education and I have been teaching English for a decade now. I joined the platform in June 2017 and I like to spend my free time on writing, taking photos or at the gym. I also like cooking. —- Q - How long have you been a curator for SteemSTEM? A - Almost a year now, I joined the curation team last Autumn. — Q - How and when did it all start? A - I think it was my Bizarre Phenomenon series that caught SteemSTEM’s attention and the guys saw some potential in me. I was contacted and asked whether I would like to participate in the curation team. I didn’t give too much thought on it, I said “YES” immediately and I was so excited to have been picked! Don’t forget, I was still a n00b around here, trying to figure how things work and a growing community wanted me to participate in it and help around. It meant a lot! — Q - How often do you curate? A - Whenever I have enough time. When I wasn’t as busy as I am today, I used to curate every day for an hour or so. But later, as work and life in general became more time consuming, I had to adjust my curating routine. Now, I try to go through new posts every day, but I can’t always make it. Q - What do you enjoy the most about this task? A - The joy that people feel “rewarded” for their good work and that their time and effort did not go unnoticed. I remember how excited I got when I saw upvotes and comments in posts that I had worked hard to make, and being able to provide this feeling to others who try hard here is amazing. We are trying to build a community for the science lovers, authors some people out there would consider “geeks”. Well, we love those “geeks”, we are those “geeks” and we will always enjoy learning and discussing what we’ve learnt. — Q - Do you ever get asked for favors? How do you react? A - I rarely get people asking me for favors. When I do, I try to be kind and see if their request is reasonable enough. Q - Do you have a favorite scientific topic that you have fun reading and reviewing, over others? A - I like animal and nature posts mostly. When they are accompanied with original photos and videos I like them even more. You see, Steem is a blogging platform, when people add their personal touch and experience into their posts, their writing becomes “unique”. I might enjoy reading a post on “the lightning phenomenon” for example, but if you have your amazing shots from last night’s thunderstorm, then your post becomes even more interesting in my eyes. Q - What would be your advice to both the old and new authors who wish to join SteemSTEM but do not know where to start? A - First of all, don’t try to produce material only for the rewards. I know they are a big incentive, but it is the wrong mindset. Find topics you enjoy reading about and try learning more about them in order to make posts that will satisfy your curiosity and then others’. If you are a scientist or a teacher, tell us about your work! What you deal with every day, interesting news in your field, experiences, explain how you do things and why, what is it you’re trying to achieve? You need to “stand out” using your personal style and making this community “richer” by adding your knowledge and personality to it. Get involved, don’t just produce posts, consume too! Spend one or two hours a week to see what others have written and bother to express your opinion, give your feedback (positive or negative, feedback is always helpful) or help out when the community needs you! Follow our guidelines, please. They are easy to find even for newcomers, they are very well-written and they will help you get an idea of how things work here. Be yourself (unless you’re a cat, then be a cat) and don’t try to reproduce boring theories we can find on wikipedia. Or even if you’re no expert and you need wikipedia, then use it, but do it in a way that no one else would ever do. We appreciate your critical thinking and personality, not the 15th rewording of a wiki article on butterflies. — Q - What is your wish for SteemSTEM? A - I wish to see it grow even more, I know it will! Advancements are taking place month after month. I believe that in 5 years we will have expanded a lot more and I hope we will be running a community where people will join to learn and teach things, fruitful dialogues will be a routine and why not, universities will be here to spread their word and even monetize their research (too much of wishful thinking?). — Q - Where do you see yourself in 5 years? A - Travelling the world to see most of the amazing places I cover on my series of phenomena (if I’ve become a crypto-millionaire) and making more posts about them! Jokes aside, I hope I will still be here, helping out however I can and having fun at the same time. — Q - Where do you see SteemSTEM in 5 years? A - There is so much going on behind the scenes and some people are spending long hours of work. We are not just a curation group anymore. I believe SteemSTEM will thrive in the next years and will manage to bring science closer to everyday people. But it will also draw the attention (hopefully) of institutions, as they can use the blockchain as a medium of communication and monetization. Imagine SteemSTEM getting so big in the future, where it could even raise funds for scholarships, how cool would that be? — I would like to thank @ruth-girl for taking the time and provide us with her insightful information and tips for SteemSTEM authors. And quoting from her latest blog, what are the latest interests of Ruth? &gt; What I’ve been up to: @steemstem has now got a witness running, the @stem.witness! We would really appreciate your vote. And you can always check out our app, steemstem.io! &gt; @aristotle.team is the child of the Greek translation team (working for @davinci.witness and @utopian-io). It starts as a small, organized effort and we soon aspire to see it grow and facilitate our work in the translations category, support translation posts and become a medium of communicating news, stats and helpful tips considering translations.

[Join us on #steemSTEM] The missionThe project and its members seek to achieve this goal through direct promotion of quality content (through upvotes, comments and resteem via the @steemstem account). Additional bonus rewards in Steem/Steem Power/SBD are sometimes given directly to the creators of well written, informative and clearly cited STEM content, with an added focus on promoting the topics that are of the most interest to the community (based on community engagement). The assessment of the quality of the content is achieved by a team of anonymous curators with expertise in various STEM disciplines who donate their time (free of charge) for the betterment of Steemit and the community. Author GuidelinesWhat does it take to be steemSTEM approved? Approval for promotion by the project is open to any imaginable topic so long as it is related to a STEM discipline. Science is best learned when an open conversation can be had, so that no topic, even controversial issues, is off limits for promotion by this project. Additionally any biases by members of the curation team are not to influence the selection. The steemSTEM project is not out to criticise any viewpoint, and will actively promote even those topics that the members disagree with. That said, open disclosure of sources is an absolute must in scientific writing. Authors must provide citations for all images and resources used in the construction of the posted materials. Additionally, all facts must be supported by accessible sources. Preventing the spread of plagiarism is imperative to the future success of Steemit, and the steemSTEM project will take these issues seriously. Authors are free to utilize the #steemSTEM tag in their posts set of tags to indicate they wish to be considered for promotion by @steemstem. Upon approval of a post by the steemSTEM team, the author will be provided with a “steemSTEM approved” image in a comment that they can edit into their post and display, to serve as a badge of quality such that readers and voters know that they are supporting high quality STEM content.

Next in line we have @chloroform and another great post on zombies! What if all these imaginative films and novels were a reality? Everything you need to know about zombies lies hidden in @chloroform’s post! Saturday - Sunday ### How unique are you? The science of individual differences. Anyone in for some biology? Because we have an awesome post by @scienceblocks that is discussing genetic differences. Are we more similar than different on a genetic level? Do we share common patterns with each other? How “identical” can identical twins be? All the answers in @scienceblocks’ post! ### Venus at Inferior Conjunction We started with photography and we are closing with astrophotography and our amazing @terrylovejoy! In this last pick for the week, we see how @terrylovejoy didn’t miss the chance to take photos of Venus’ crescent while the planet was at inferior conjunction with the Earth and the Sun. Keep an eye on his blog, he’s getting some more pics out soon! A few words about the nomination process For some time, the editorial team behind this distilled series is made of a one-woman-team, @ruth-girl, and she chooses her favorite posts (potentially discussing with other curators and/or the management). Posts written by the SteemSTEM team are excluded from the nomination process. Please do not be discouraged if you did not make it on this issue. We are picking up in total 6 posts a week out of more than 150-200. The chances are thus low ;) In the meantime, you may wish to check these guidelines for extra tips on how your writing could be more effective. Authors upvoted by the SteemSTEM team In the spirit of being transparent about our actions that are now supported by @utopian-io, @curie, our delegators, our trailers and our manual curator supporters, we release every week the list of authors who have caught the attention of the @steemstem curation team. From October 7 to October 14, we rewarded 109 different authors who have written a total of 127 different articles. The 83 authors who received votes from @steemstem, @utopian-io and @curie all together that week are: @abdulmath, @abigail-dantes, @acont, @ajpacheco1610, @alexaivytorres, @alexander.alexis, @alexdory, @amestyj, @anasav, @ancolie, @answerswithjoe, @antigenx, @ari16, @aurackle, @biffybirdcam, @btoye, @carlagonz, @chappertron, @charlesx, @chloroform, @conficker, @cryptogee, @cryptoitaly, @dark69, @discovery-it, @drifter1, @drifter2, @dysfunctional, @edgarlopez, @egotheist, @eliaschess333, @elvigia, @erickyoussif, @fran.frey, @gaescla, @germanmontero, @henrychidiebere, @hidden84, @highonthehog, @hillaryisidore, @isisfemale, @ivymalifred, @jasonbu, @josedelacruz, @kenadis, @luiscd8a, @lupafilotaxia, @magicmonk, @maryed, @masterwriter, @maverickinvictus, @mela, @menoski, @miroslavrc, @moncia90, @n4zrizulkafli, @nature.alchemist, @nikolanikola, @nonzerosum, @okunlolayk, @phage93, @pharmacy-jinni, @rbalzan79, @reinaseq, @rharphelle, @rifkan, @rosemery, @ruth-girl, @samminator, @scienceangel, @serialfiller, @sorin.lite, @stayoutoftherz, @steemit-italia, @steempsych, @svemirac, @talmid, @terrylovejoy, @thurllanie, @tychoxi, @viannis, @victory622, @ycam, @ydavgonzalez, @zen-art [Credits: @hightouch] All curation rewards earned will be used to fund @steemstem project functioning and activities.

Let’s read some information about what the Curators do and let us interrogate, uhm sorry, I mean interview @aboutcoolscience! ## The Curators of SteemSTEM What do they do? Well, their tasks include searching for new STEM authors, evaluating and reviewing STEM articles, conducting thorough searches for plagiarism and they are the people who will suggest whether or not a STEM article has to be upvoted and supported by @steemstem. ### Let’s get to know the Curators better, shall we? A community gets bigger and stronger as its members work together, get to know each other, learn from each other. Evolve. Flourish. Who are the curators of SteemSTEM? How long are they going through the STEM posts? What makes a post unique according to them? Is their job easy? We are planning to interview the SteemSTEM curators with the goal and hope to inspire you and to shed more light about how the curation process works. In our first interview, @ruth-girl revealed many curation secrets .. What could be next? In this post @aboutcoolscience is interviewed by @katerinaramm! If you have any extra questions or thoughts, feel free to let someone from the PR team know! ## Let the curtain open! If you are interested in biology, you surely have read posts of @aboutcoolscience. Some of his most interesting blogs include T-Cells, some interesting ways to defy death and I am sure you would want to know more about prolonged youth! Curating both English and Italian STEM blogs, @aboutcoolscience has been asked to let us know what positive or negative impressions he gets about posts and gives us some useful tips. Plus there is a bonus question, so make sure to read the whole interview! – Q - Hi @aboutcoolscience, thank you for taking the time to reply to our questions! Let us know a few things about yourself: What is your real (first) name? What do you do, where are you from, how long have you been on Steem and what are your hobbies? A - Ciao! My name is Gianluca, I’m from Italy but I moved to the US for my postdoc few years ago and now I’m a scientist. I used to have many hobbies like cycling, hiking and going for long walks with friends. However, a year ago I joined Steem and my activities on the platform increased so much in the last few months that I had to give up many of my previous hobbies. However, now I am involved in several communities on this platform and I am interacting with so many great people, so it’s definitely worth it. —- Q - How long have you been a curator for SteemSTEM? A - I’ve been a curator since early 2018. — Q - How and when did it all start? A - I did not become a curator right away. When I joined Steem there was much more activity (Steem price was higher) and there were bigger issues with spam also with the SteemSTEM tag, so it was difficult to get noticed and to receive support. I remember asking SteemSTEM if they could support other language communities because several science posts were not supported in other languages (like in the Italian community). So initially, I became the curator for the Italian sub-community and I founded @itastem. I am happy to see that today we can also support several other languages. — Q - How often do you curate? A - I try to curate every day. It’s not always easy to find the time because I have a hectic schedule but I do what I can. —- — Q - What is the first thing that you take into consideration when curating? A - Am I going to remember anything about this post in 2 days? Posts should be informative and give value to the reader, surprise them and make them curious about the topic. — Q - Tell us something that really gives you a great first impression when you see a SteemSTEM post. (It could have to do with the chosen topic, images, structure etc) A - Choosing the right topic is important but it’s also important to do some research on the topic. It’s challenging to convey several new concepts in a short text but it’s something I take into consideration when I evaluate a post. So I value posts with high density of information conveyed in a easy to read format. I know it’s not easy to do that but that’s what I consider a quality post. — — Q - Do you have a favorite scientific topic that you have fun reading and reviewing over any others? A - I like to read about things I did not know before, usually I prefer biology posts because it’s my field but if something is well written I don’t mind reading it. Users should consider that if something is on Wikipedia it means it’s probably common knowledge and nothing new. —- Q - Tell us something that really makes you disappointed when you see a SteemSTEM post. (It could have to do with the chosen topic, images, structure etc) A - I hate when I find that a post is plagiarized. It’s disrepectful towards the original author but also towards the curator that has to read something that has been copy/pasted. I can do better things with my time… — Q - What would be your advice to both the old and new authors who wish to join SteemSTEM but do not know where to start? A - Be patient and have some humility. The first thing most users get frustrated about is why their “wonderful” post did not receive the same support as other posts. But if you look thoroughly you start seeing that maybe their post did not have a clear structure, the topic chosen was not interesting or they simply put down a few concepts randomly so they can tell themselves they did their homework. They should ask themselves: is this something I would want to read? It’s sad but I think some users can’t even stand to read their own posts. In general it takes time to build a reputation and cultivate a following, if your first post did not receive much attention it’s normal, it means you need to get more involved in the community because probably nobody knows you. — Q - If you could interview anyone from SteemSTEM, who would it be? A - I have a chance to interact with many of them already but probably new users don’t know well the founders of SteemStem, what about @justtryme90? — Q - If you could have any job in the world, what would you choose? A - I like learning, that’s why I’m a scientist but there are many things I don’t like about academia and how it’s structured. Maybe being an independent writer would allow some freedom and a better work/life balance. — Q - Would you like to tell us what other projects you support besides SteemSTEM? A - I do many things besides SteemSTEM, I am one of the users behind the DaVinci witness, we also recently started a collaboration with @utopian-io for the translation of open source projects so currently we work with more than 100 translators on this mission and I am pleased to see that our community is growing almost daily. — Q - Could you describe in as few words as possible what science means to you? A - Science is curiosity, but the aim should not be just to accumulate knowledge but also its dissemination. To do that you must be a good communicator, I think a drawing I commissioned a while ago to @pab.ink explains it all: Which comes from a quote by Einstein: “It would be possible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no sense; it would be without meaning, as if you described a Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure.” So the communication aspect is very important for the dissemination of knowledge. — Q - And here is a (described as ‘hard’) question I was advised to ask :) Hint: You don’t have to reply… but it will surely be fun to! Which metal has more value to society, Adamantium or Vibranium? (credits for the question to @mobbs) A - I guess Adamantium, everyone likes Wolverine :) — Q - What is your wish for SteemSTEM? A - To continue to grow and to see more participation from the users. — Q - Where do you see yourself in 5 years? A - I may like to go back to Europe someday, I still have too much to see there. — Q - Where do you see SteemSTEM in 5 years? A - I would not be surprised if SteemSTEM starts working more closely with professionals and educational institutions, who knows.. —- I would like to thank Gianluca a lot for the time he took replying to all my questions! — @aboutcoolscience is also the founder of @itastem and if you are an Italian reading this post, you can consider writing STEM in Italiano. ——– Read our last Distilled #79 || Get Incentives for promoting steemSTEM || Vote for steemSTEM Witness || Visit our new home steemstem.io Image Source 1 - Image Source 2 This page is synchronized from the post: Interviewing the SteemSTEM Curators - @aboutcoolscience document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@steemstem/interviewing-the-steemstem-curators-aboutcoolscience/"},{"title":"SteemSTEM Distilled #80","text":"Welcome to the 80th issue of SteemSTEM Distilled, a curation effort by the members of the @steemstem team.

If you have any extra questions or thoughts, feel free to let someone from the PR team know! ## Let the curtain open! Our very first interview was with our curator @ruth-girl, who inspired us greatly, and we continued with interviewing Gianluca (aka @aboutcoolscience) who let us know more about how cool science is and can be. This time we bring before you Aleksandar (@alexs1320)! Aleksandar will be celebrating his fist Steemiversary in November 2018, and he has been a very active member of the community. Let’s see what he shared with us in this interview! – Q - Hi Alex, thank you for taking the time to reply to our questions! Let us know a few things about yourself: What is your real (first) name? What do you do, where are you from, how long have you been on Steem and what are your hobbies? A - As you could rightly assume, my first name is Aleksandar. I’m from Serbia, a small country in South-Eastern Europe. I discovered Steemit by pure chance after a FB debate about BTC right around the time when I made my CV-like blog. It was almost a year ago. I like outdoor activities, cycling, photography, cars and military history. —- Q - What do the numbers after your name mean? A - When I opened my first email, I wanted to be “132” in the name of the very first car I’ve driven (when I was 10 or 11). It was a lovely Fiat 132, dark blue, with unforgetable engine noise. Unfortunately 132 was already taken, so I added 0. — Q - How long have you been a curator for SteemSTEM? A - At first I became a curator for the local language community, YU-STEM, in winter 2018. Since spring 2018 I became “global curator” as well. — Q - How and when did it all start? A - I asked @lemouth if we could create our local community, and he said “yes” :) — Q - How often do you curate? A - Several times a day, when I’m taking a break from other activities. — Q - What is the first thing that you take into consideration when curating? A - Competence. If I see the post from a respected author, it’s easy to curate, because they are real experts in their respected fields. We have never experienced any problems with them. On the other hand, if I spot a new author, I check their background and very often it rings the alarm in my head. — — Q - Tell us something that really gives you a great first impression when you see a SteemSTEM post. (It could have to do with the chosen topic, images, structure etc) A - In my opinion, good post can only be writen if the author is devoted to the certain topic. When you see such post, you can notice the details that you can’t find on Wiki or daily newspapers. This is why I like to see that the author is consistently writing about something from their area of expertise. On the other hand, it’s incredibly easy to notice if someone is rephrasing the text. — Q - Do you have a favorite scientific topic that you have fun reading and reviewing over any others? A - Biology… And the posts written by real enthusiasts. I would like to see more tech, but good tech, from the first hand experience, not “how stuff works”. —- — Q - Tell us something that really makes you disappointed or angry when you see a SteemSTEM post. (It could have to do with the chosen topic, images, structure etc) A - I can’t stand Wiki and Book re-wording. Books are made by real experts and if I want to read a book - I’ll take a book. Wiki is free and there is no reason to upvote something that is a degraded free content. I want to read what YOU are doing. What is YOUR hobby, YOUR interests. Wiki and Books are not adding any value. It’s actually harming us all. Just imagine the potential investor, checking the platform… “Wow, I could buy those coins that are given for plagiarism, so I could earn more coins to foster more low-quality content.” What is the value of that? It’s Zero, 0. We are representing a brand. If we can make something good and put our posts on the very first page in Google Search (and many authors can do it), we are promoting the whole platform and project. This is why I’m advocating for fostering excellence, competence and originality. — Q - What would be your advice to both the old and new authors who wish to join SteemSTEM but do not know where to start? A - Write about the topics you are passionate about. About the topics that you really know. About the things you really do. — Q - If you could interview anyone from SteemSTEM, who would it be and ask him/her one question now? A - @dber, where are you man, we are missing you?! — Q - If you could have any job in the world, what would you choose? A - I think that life is just. After the 30th birthday, most people are positioned where they feel comfortable. When you are choosing a job, you need a balance between earnings, time and interests. I’m very happy with my current situation. — Q - Would you like to tell us what other projects you support besides SteemSTEM? A - I’m involved in DaVinci-Utopian translations and I think that SteemQ will be a great project. And of course, teamserbia and teamslovenia have my attention as well. I’m also daydreaming about my own history related project. — — Q - Could you describe in as few words as possible what science means to you? A - Pushing the boundaries, driven by curiosity and devotion. — Q - We’ve seen you gain a reputation as somebody who takes no sh. If you could give any advice to yourself and to the people who provoke you, what would it be? A - I need to explain this in more detail, so you can understand my atypical behavior for a young, well-educated European. First, I’m not angry at all. I simply know how to speak to specific sorts of people. In Serbia, we don’t have no-go zones, ZUP/ZUS, whatever. We are living together. University professors next to a sportsmen and convicted criminals and the odd creepy guy. We are spending many hours outside the house and consequently we are encountering all those people. You can’t communicate in the same way with a person with 120 IQ points and 70 IQ points. They can’t understand your logic, your arguments, your words… When you are encountering very angry people with low IQ, willing to fight for no reason, you need to know how to defend yourself. You need to be prepared to use the words, very bad words and physical force. You need to show the attitude that you are more powerful, that you are more dominant and that you are not going to obey their silly rules. Those Western generations born after 1990 are so soft I can’t imagine. Someone sent me hate mail. So what, don’t read. I need a safe space to mourn because Trump won. And that is going to change what? Someone is begging me for a vote/ removal from the blacklist. Send them to hell, they don’t deserve any mercy! And the most important lesson: people don’t change. Ever. Don’t even try to fix them. — Q - What is your wish for SteemSTEM? A - To cut all sick branches and start growing again. — Q - Where do you see yourself in 5 years? A - In Alpistan (my expression for SWI, AUT, SLO and northern ITA). — Q - Where do you see SteemSTEM in 5 years? A* - Difficult question… There are way too many factors. It could be just a distant memory, or it could be the logo of our Lambo.* —- Thank you Alex! — Read our last Distilled #80 || Get Incentives for promoting steemSTEM || Vote for steemSTEM Witness || Visit our new home steemstem.io Image Source 1 - Image Source 2 ___ We hope you will consider delegating to @steemstem (ROI: 65% of the curation rewards):50SP | 100SP | 500SP | 1000SP | 5000SP | 10000SP | This page is synchronized from the post: Interviewing the SteemSTEM Curators - @alexs1320 document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@steemstem/interviewing-the-steemstem-curators-alexs1320/"},{"title":"Some fresh news on our app steemstem.io - v0.2 is out","text":"Exactly one month ago, we proudly announced the release of our new (open-source) app in the Steem ecosystem, steemstem.io, dedicated to the SteemSTEM project. We believe that this app will serve as the gateway to reach our long-term goal of building a novel science communication medium on Steem. Ushering in a new era of scientific transparency and informational accessability thanks to blockchain technology. Through steemstem.io, we will hence offer top researchers an incentivised way to share and communicate about their research directly with people across the globe, on the Steem blockchain. To that end efforts are underway to reach out research institutes and scientists and to bring them to Steem. In an effort to keep the community updated, here we provide you the latest news on the development of our app! The steemstem.io App in a Nutshell On steemstem.io, only posts approved by our team of curators are featured, chronologically. Rather than censoring content, we apply quality filters that can be easily removed if needed. As such, all posts carrying the #steemstem tag can be displayed by a simple click of the ‘show all posts’ button. The steemstem.io homepage by default displays posts (carrying the #steemstem tag) written in English, other languages are easily accessible by a simple click on a flag (steemstem.io currently supports six languages) and extra filters on specific subcategories (math, physics, psychology, etc.) can be applied. In addition, whitelisted authors get extra exposure for free, on the right column of the main page. This is illustrated above with a sexy post ;) For any user, extra exposure can be obtained by sending 3 STEEM to @steemstem-io with a link as a memo (the exact price may vary with time). As soon as the post is upvoted by SteemSTEM, it will appear on the top menu of the app, which includes 7 free spots. Posts deemed not suitable for curation will have their promotional 3 STEEM refunded. This feature is for the moment manual but will be automated in the future. Furthermore, our app also allows one to do anything that could be expected from a Steem front-end: logging in, voting, posting, managing the wallet, etc. The development team and the source code The version (v0.1) released on October 1st was developed entirely by @hightouch and @planetenamek from @fundition. However, their time is not unlimited, and it was clear from the start that some new developer will have to take over for them at some point. Whilst this position is still open (please contact us on discord if interested), @lemouth decided that he needed to add javascript mastery to his diverse set of skills and is now performing app development duties, under the guidance of @hightouch. As a result, today SteemSTEM proudly announces version v0.2 of its app. For those interested, the source code is open access and available from our SteemSTEM GitHub repository. Change log for steemstem.io v0.2 Two post display bugs have been corrected. First, a variety of user comments were previously appearing in the main page, wrongly tagged by the platform as full posts. Secondly, the filtering mechanism to only show posts upvoted by steemstem was not properly functioning, resulting in loss of posts that should have been displayed. There were also issues with the creation of new posts. Posts can now be constructed and published with the steemstem.io app without any problem. The layout of the ‘create post‘ page has moreover been improved and the management of draft posts has been fixed and ameliorated. It is now possible to save multiple post drafts for later publishing. Finally, on the more minor side, a few (in principle invisible) backend bugs have been fixed, making the code cleaner in terms of the number of error messages printed on a console, and the problem with the sign-in button being half outside the page has been fixed. To-do list towards steemstem.io v0.3 In the next release, we aim to add a few extra features. - Post editing will be enabled (yes, this important feature is still missing). - It will be made possible to include post beneficiaries when posting from steemstem.io. - Draft preview will be added. - Additional minor bug fixes and implementation of community feedback. Moreover, please do not hesitate to report any bug in the comments to this post, as well as to suggest any feature you would like us to develop.

A beautiful post by @erh.germany is here to open the curtain of this week’s issue. “Hyperinflation” of mental disease, is it a trend? Are we as crazy as we think? Are we just over-reacting? Erika does a very good research on the subject and you know through which link to read it! ### Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN): A technology for the masses. With technology we move ahead and @henrychidiebere writes about WLAN networks and explains everything you need to know about them. Wednesday - Friday ### The Most Dangerous Ant in the World @agmoore has made a fantastic post about ants “invading” hospitals. Read on to learn more about the “most dangerous ant in the world” as she calls it and its destructive effects. ### Childhood stressors and the beginning of pathogenesis chain reaction (Part 2 - We carry the baggage of our childhood) More psychology for you and @scienceblocks discusses stressors during childhood. When does the damage start and how? A very interesting piece you should not miss! Saturday - Sunday ### The neuroscience of music - your brain function and behavior are impacted Another gem posted by @zen-art will show you what exactly music does to your brain. Wonderfully written and very detailed, it will surely teach you a lot! ### A: What are the advantages and disadvantages of nuclear fusion compared to renewable sources? And the curtain closes with an amazing comeback, @maticpecovnik (yes, the “fusion guy”) has been swimming around the steemSTEM waters again and this time he speaks of the results of a “crash test” between nuclear fusion and renewable energy sources.

To sum up a long story, the steemSTEM project is a community-supported project aiming to increase the quality and the visibility of STEM (STEM is the acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) articles on Steemit. The 20-days status reportAs a first step towards this aim, the steemSTEM crew has started to promote quality STEM content posted on Steemit with upvotes, comments and resteems via the @steemstem account. Moreover, an extra bonus reward in Steem Power has been sometimes given directly to the creators of well written, informative and correctly referenced STEM articles. Do not therefore hesitate to follow the @steemstem account for being kept up-to-date of good STEM Steemit articles! We try to guarantee at least 5 good posts a week! We show below the list of posts that we have resteemed and granted a 5SP reward to their author during the last 20 days. We have hence redistributed a total of 155 SP to the community (and we recall that all steemSTEM members are working freely for the beauty of the project)! The list also illustrates the diversity of topics that have attracted our attention. It is a real pleasure to encourage following those authors who create great STEM content on Steemit. Finally, as a Christmas present, we have decided to increase the reward to 10 SP from now on.

[Join us on #steemSTEM] One of the goals of the SteemSTEM project is to promote learning. The best way to learn about a topic is often to teach it to others! Steem and Steemit provide us with the unique opportunity to get rewarded for such efforts, and the SteemSTEM initiative affords us the opportunity to further reward the best contributions! What Am I Supposed To Write About?The writing prompt for this round is open, so you can write about any topic you are interested in, as long as it is connected to the STEM fields. The only requirement is that YOU find the topic interesting, and think others could learn something by reading about it! The Potential Prizes 1st Place - 100 Steem Power + 33% of Steem/SBD earned from this post (4.224 STEEM) 2nd Place - 50 Steem Power + 33% of Steem/SBD earned from this post (4.224 STEEM) 3rd Place - 25 Steem Power + 33% of Steem/SBD earned from this post (4.224 STEEM) If you rank in the top three your post will be re-steemed in addition to the bonus monetary prize. Three Simple Rules Be Nice Have Fun Cite ALL your sources EntryEntry is simple, just tag your post with the dedicated #steemstem-competition1 tag. To make sure your entry is noticed you can join the #SteemSTEM chat and let us know that you submitted a post. Judging and RankingThe jury assessing the quality of the posts will be comprised of three members of the SteemSTEM team, @anarchyhasnogods, @lemouth, and @justtryme90. As with all aspects of the SteemSTEM project, the team is prohibited from participating. All the inputs come from the community and all of the rewards go back to the community! We will each assign your post a score based on 4 guidelines. Accuracy - 15 pts Comprehensibility - 15 pts Formatting - 5 pts Appropriate citations and references - 5 pts Accuracy We will check for the scientific accuracy of your post. Remember that spreading inaccurate and/or false information leads to confusion for your readers! Comprehensibility We will rate on how easy it is to read and understand the text. Garbled text or text that is too technical can be hard to understand. Good scientific writing makes even complex topics seem simple. Formatting We will rate the post on how good it looks. People notice the formatting before the text. Large solid blocks of text are difficult to read and concentrate on, no matter the comprehensibility of the text. We are not looking for advanced formatting techniques, just basic, solid formatting. Citations Just citing your sources isn’t always enough. Listing the sources below the block of text you used them in can make it easier to follow what you got from where. The goal of citing information is not just to give credits, it also serves as a way for your readers to learn more if they are interested. Remember science is a discipline focused on learning and discovery, we should all work to help others achieve that when they read what we write. After evaluating each post, we (@steemstem) will leave a comment on it with the score and why we scored it like the way we did. We will post the results, emphasize the three top posts (together with the reasons why we have chosen them) once the contest will be over. Entry starts Monday January 30th and ends Sunday February 5th, exactly one week. The results will be announced within the following week, unless there happens to be a major turnout.

It’s been a jam-packed few weeks! The development team has been working hard to release the new SteemSTEM app version, the curators have been tirelessly reviewing new posts by prominent STEM authors, our new @stem.witness is already included in the top 100 witnesses and interviews with our curators are continuing, receiving great interest by all of you! This bi-weekly blog is shared with you in our efforts to bring the community closer together with the goal of keeping you updated about what is going on behind and in front of the scenes! ### Updated Version of Steemstem.io app! —- Our new open source app, steemstem.io was released one month ago and we have received great support and feedback from everyone who tried it out! SteemSTEM new app aims to become a valuable tool with which STEM lovers and researchers will be able to communicate and share information all around the globe. On steemstem.io, visitors will be able to see only posts that will be approved by our dedicated curators. Quality filters are applied that users can of course remove with a click. The users can also filter the posts depending on language or specific category of their interest (math, physics, etc.) In the most recent update, the users can now create posts directly by logging in (via steemconnect) to steemstem.io ! You can also create more than one draft and publish them at will. A few display bugs have been fixed and we are already working on new features such as post editing, adding draft preview and adding the possibility of including beneficiaries. More information about the v0.2 of the app can be found here and there (for the technical changes). #### Moreover, v0.2.2 has been deployed this morning, and it includes in particular post edition! — ### Public Domain Images — Some of the difficulties encountered by many STEM authors was finding specific scientific images released to the public domain. Images are very important for constructing a more pleasantly readable post and conveying a message in an easier way. For those who may not understand what the issue is all about, please take a few moments to read the guidelines on copyright standards about images. So if you wish, take some time to visit SteemSTEM’s Repository of Public Domain Images here and feel free to reach to us on discord if you wish to contribute or for any queries. —– ### Making a Case to Vote for a Witness of Knowledge, @stem.witness — Many Steem users have little knowledge of what a witness is, what they do, and why it is important to vote for them. @mobbs has crafted an informational post regarding what people may want from their witnesses. Witnesses should be contributing to the community. They should be able to make rational decisions and most of all: ###### Witnesses should be able to make a difference All the above and much more to be announced soon are what makes @stem.witness one of the most promising witnesses deserving of our support. Take some time and visit the latest post by @mobbs, in order to understand more about why @stem.witness is making a difference. — ### More Interviews! — Our Interviews with the Curators have brought those all-mighty Steem users before you. They have revealed their curation secrets and have provided useful advice about what to do and what to avoid in order to become a successful STEM author! Our latest interview provided insight and a few different approaches about what plagiarism is. Feel free to visit the link and learn more about our curator @alexs1320 here and what he had to say to us! You can also check out the interview of @ruth-girl here and click here where you will find the interview of @aboutcoolscience! —- ### A Sneak Peak to the Upcoming News — More updates, upcoming feature at steemstem io v0.3 to be deployed in a few days (with post editing as a kwey novel feature) and a new interview is in the making! Stay Tuned! — ### Bonus News - For more Technical Information …! — If you are interested in the more technical aspect of the steemstem.io development, you can follow the alt-account of @lemouth, @lemouth-dev.

Evolve. Flourish. — ###### Introducing .. @mathowl! — Maybe you have seen his googlyeyes posts, perhaps you have been awarded a scientific owl in the past? Maybe you have even read his colorful math posts and have since then grown a deep desire and lust for math (!) Whatever the case is, his humor has certainly been one the of the first thing one notices, right from the beginning. @MathOwl would you still like him if he was called chin-chill math or MathBunny? has come to Steem to stir the waters! In this post @mathowl is interviewed by @katerinaramm! If you have any extra questions or thoughts, feel free to let someone from the PR team know! ## Let’s shed some light! – Q - Hi Mathowl, thank you for taking the time to reply to our questions! Let us know a few things about yourself: What is your real (first) name? What do you do, where are you from, how long have you been on Steem and what are your hobbies? A - Hi Kat! Thanks for the opportunity. Currently, I am still a Mathematics PhD student but in about two months I can scrap the student part. My ethnicity is mixed; Dutch-Malaysian-Chinese, and my Dutch name is Thomas. I have been on Steem about a year. My hobbies are playing piano, juggling, programming, petting furry animals and dropping puns. Unfortunately, I don’t have a good o-pun-ning pun. — Q - How long have you been a curator for SteemSTEM? A - I guess for about 8 months — Q - How and when did it all start? A - I started with some scientific curation of myself using my owl stickers, then I became an honor member and when there was a job-opening on the curation team I slipped in. — Q - How often do you curate? A - The last month I haven’t been so active since I am busy job hunting but I do check the curation channel everyday. — Q - What is the first thing that you take into consideration when curating? A - Uniqueness and community impact. Sharing unique information which can be absorbed by the community is the pillar of any form of media. Within the framework of STEM this unique information does not necessarily have to be scientific facts but it can also be an explanation style, interpretation etc. — — Q - Tell us something that really gives you a great first impression when you see a SteemSTEM post. (It could have to do with the chosen topic, images, structure etc) A - When I click on a post I immediately check citations and copyright licenses. So if you get those right you get in the green with me. — Q - Do you have a favorite scientific topic that you have fun reading and reviewing over any others? A - I do like to read posts about math on the frontiers. But the last few months there has not been much activity in this field. — Q - Tell us something that really makes you disappointed or angry when you see a SteemSTEM post. (It could have to do with the chosen topic, images, structure etc) A - Plagiarism, copy/paste, tag-abuse; pretty much any type of abuse. For math posts I get unhappy if they apply empirical thinking to mathematics. Other than that there is not much that gets my blood pumping. — Q - What would be your advice to both the old and new authors who wish to join SteemSTEM but do not know where to start? A - If you don’t know what to write about, write about what you like then your audience is bounded from below by one. — — Q - If you could interview anyone from SteemSTEM, who would it be and ask him/her one question now? A - It would probably be you! And I would want to ask you how you find the time to do so much for SteemSTEM. — Q - What does Mathematics mean to you? A - It is a form of art where the requirement is truth and goal is beauty. — — Q - Would you like to share with us more info about your PhD? A - My PhD concerns modelling single celled fungi growth. On first glance this might seem very biological but modelling this type of growth requires more math than biology. I constructed governing equations for specific fungi cell and then validated that these describe physical growth using rigorous numerics. This means that I created a program which performs mathematical proofs. The reason why these tools are necessary is that an ordinary program can make mistakes when solving equations. In my case if the computer even makes a small mistake then this might mean that the solution I get is very wrong. So a proof-based system is necessary to show the validity of the model. — Q - Is there a great Mathematician that you really admire? And Why? A - In the class of living mathematicians it is John Milnor. In the olden days mathematicians obtained great results in different mathematical research areas. John Milnor is the last of this generation. Connecting different branches of mathematics used to be a very important goal in mathematics but somehow nowadays they are driven to work on very specialised topics which do not add much to the big picture. — Q - When you have children, how do you plan to make your kids love math? A - Monty hall problem, but by replacing the car by candy and the goat by doing the dishes :D —- Q - If you could have any job in the world, what would you choose? A - Full-time mathematics researcher. Unfortunately, this job does not really exist since even at the top of academic food chain you are not spending most of your work hours on doing research. So I am really interested in a job where I can use interesting mathematics everyday. — Q - Would you like to tell us what other projects you support besides SteemSTEM? A - I am a member of Steemflagrewards. It is a project which rewards Steemians for flagging abuse. If you want to get rewarded for pasting googly eyes on random objects you should join the Googlyeyes project by the high-googly priest Fraenk. Another great project by Fraenk is Dustbunny which upvotes comments below the dust-threshold to above the dust-threshold. It is great for low SP steemians. In actual fact, big fish at steemSTEM are supporting Dustbunny with generous delegations (JTM, Suesa) — Q - Could you describe in as few words as possible what science means to you? A - Being able to predict — —- Q - What is your wish for SteemSTEM? A - To become a form of media known to the general public. — Q - Where do you see yourself in 5 years? A - Doing cool mathematics :o) — Thank You MathOwl! — Make sure to follow steemstem on steemstem.io, steemit, facebook, twitter, and instagram to always be up-to-date on our latest news and ideas.

A few words about the nomination process For some time, the editorial team behind this distilled series is made of a one-woman-team, @ruth-girl, and she chooses her favorite posts (potentially discussing with other curators and/or the management). Posts written by the SteemSTEM team are excluded from the nomination process. Please do not be discouraged if you did not make it on this issue. We are picking up in total 6 posts a week out of more than 150-200. The chances are thus low ;) In the meantime, you may wish to check these guidelines for extra tips on how your writing could be more effective. Authors upvoted by the SteemSTEM team In the spirit of being transparent about our actions that are now supported by @utopian-io, @curie, our delegators, our trailers and our manual curator supporters, we release every week the list of authors who have caught the attention of the @steemstem curation team.

A community gets bigger and stronger as its members work together, get to know each other, learn from each other. Evolve. Flourish. Introducing .. @Katerinaramm! Time to switch positions and let the interviewer be interviewed. Many people are curious about how exactly she manages to do all the things she does. Being in a scientific environment we unfortunately must discount slowing down time and superposition, but let’s hear it from her. Source Q: What makes you passionate about SteemSTEM? A: First of all thank you for taking the time to prepare all these very interesting questions for me. It does feel a bit strange to be the person of focus here, but I hope I can make it alive ‘til the end of this interview! I have always been a huge fan of ongoing education &amp; knowledge. The world around us evolves every second, in every possible way. We cannot just stay still. We need to learn and to take steps in any direction if we ever intend to become better and leave a safer, more humane world for our children. You may wonder what the above has to do with SteemSTEM? Well, science is all about a continuous quest. A quest to find the truth. This is what makes me passionate about STEM &gt;&gt; SteemSTEM! I saw passion, originality, both in the articles but also in people who were/are devoting time to bring knowledge to the blockchain and thus making it a better place for everyone. Q: How do you find the time to be so active? A: This is flattering, thank you, but I do not think I have been so active the last few weeks. A lot was going on in my personal &amp; business life. Health issues, new projects at work… So all these do not really leave me with much spare time for doing the things I wish to do. However, I try to set priorities and stick to them. I admit that there are times when I have prioritized Steem over my work projects (but I am lucky to have flexible cooperators) so I manage. I hope that winter will be easier, with more spare time for me to do what I have planned. Q: What do you enjoy doing the most on Steem? A: Everything! I like answering questions, I enjoy discovering new content, I like providing new information to people who might need some extra help &amp; wish to contribute, and I really love writing (but for this, little time is left :)) Steem is the only online social media entity that has helped broaden my horizons while making some true friends. I am forever grateful for that… Q: What are you doing in real life? A: I have a family that I take care of, I am working in the broad digital field aiming at bringing sales &amp; happy customers to my clients while trying to introduce blockchain technology to the people (or other way round) and dreaming of continuing my studies soon. I also wish to share that I have been practicing TKD for 2 years and I highly recommend to anyone reading this far to take some time off and find an activity they enjoy … and do it. (Get off the chair / couch / bed…! Your future self will thank you and love you more!) Q: What do you enjoy reading about? What would you read about that’s not on SteemSTEM yet? A: There are some excellent authors that I enjoy reading new and old articles!!! But one thing I really miss is computer science / blockchain / artificial intelligence related topics. I think that the posts should be somehow connected to the real world and make people think “Oh, I would love to know that, I was always wondering about it”! (I have to mention here that @Abigail-dantes is amazing in using her own stories when explaining difficult pshycological concepts) Q: Can you remember the first article that you voted on that made you say “WOW”? A: I enjoy reading so much SteemSTEM content when I have the time and there are so many authors who write the most amazing articles! I can mention a few on the top of my head (please sorry if I forget anyone) - suesa’s stories, alexander.alexis, abigail-dantes, samminator, ruth-girl, lemouth (even though I barely understand what he writes), mobbs, (I of course remember trumpman stories(!)), the debunk series by Egotheist, the amazing articles by scienceangel, mathowl, scienceblocks, and I am sure I am forgetting many others (apologies …) But if I should absolutely remember one, It would be this one: Heat Your House Using Cats; Real Science Inside! Q: Talking about SteemSTEM promotion, what was the most effective way of reaching out to people? What was the funniest fail? A: I think that at the moment the most effective way of reaching out is when we see genuine, original posts combined with the author’s personal touch &amp; point of view. This usually means that the writer is not looking for rewards, but is writing for the joy of it and will surely be happy to find a community with like-minded people from all over the world! (SteemSTEM) Funniest fail … I do not remember any funny ones at the moment, sorry! Q: Do you have any personal projects or any plans regarding Steem? A: I wish to find the time for prioritizing my projects and then work on them :) Currently I am: Assisting in the SteemSTEM public relations team &amp; honor members team, on-boarding new members and helping with questions Helping bringing education closer to the Steem people, via the official account of the Master in Digital Currencies by the University of Nicosia (@mscdigital) Curating for the Greek Community @greek-trail and supporting Greeks A proud member of the @aristotle.team - Greek Translation Team, with great Language Managers, @ruth-girl, @dimitrisp and the most amazing team (@lordneroo &amp; @trumpman ) (powered by @utopian-io &amp; @davinci.witness) Moderating and helping with writing informative content about the new fitness app @actifit Occasionally contributing for @utopian-io at the blog &amp; tutorial category Q: Apart from reading your in-depth tutorials, what would you recommend to the new SteemSTEM bloggers? A: I recommend to anyone joining steem(it) and SteemSTEM… Please do not think you know it all. Be humble, open your mind to new things and listen to what the more experienced users have to suggest. Make sure you have clear expectations. It is ok to be here just for fun, it is even ok to be here for making money. However it is important to be honest, straightforward and modest. If you are here to stay, if you are here to cheat, if you are here to lie -&gt; This will be revealed. (Not sure if some of these articles would be useful to anyone reading this?) Q: What would you do if you got 100k (one hundred thousand) Steem tomorrow? How would it change your activity, what would you support and how? A: Highly hypothetical questions result to extreme hypothetical answers… And since it ain’t happening, I do not wish to put much thought to it. Sorry to disappoint you :) It is best to have a new goal and to create the opportunities / path towards it.

Crypto as a whole and STEEM specifically are certainly not of exception to the phenomenon of change. Prices fluctuate and active user-ship waxes and wanes along with broad market movements. Dealing with change, is a part of growing an organization or a community. The successful will be those who are flexible, nimble, able to adapt to what ever the world throws at them. SteemSTEM looks to be that way, and we feel that we have a community that welcomes changes, while still keeping our eyes pointing forward. We have all witnessed the recent decline in the value of STEEM, and we are sure you all also see the declining number of content creators on the Steem blockchain. Good times will surely return again, but in the meantime we must adapt. Ideas that were effective in the past may not work in the current climate. However the reverse is also true, things that were infeasible before may now become viable paths forward. Today’s weekly update will neither focus on the here and now, nor on recent developments (they are plentiful as for instance the development on steemstem.io continues). We instead look to use this update blog as a call for community input on all project-related issues recently raised on our discord server. We also present, for the first time, some proposed solutions and directions which we came up with. Whilst nothing of this has been implemented yet, the outcome and reactions to this blog are crucial to help us in setting priorities and finalizing what we should do. # Curation The first area of concern involves content curation and transparency of how posts are voted upon. In discussions with a small number of community members, it was made known that it is not the reward size that community members are unhappy with. Instead, it is lack of clarity around what defines the strength of a curated posts vote. While writing such reports takes time and energy, the amount of posts being currently supported is small. As a result curators have more free time, relatively to even 6 months prior. Therefore, we may have a way to correct this, by asking curators to work more… with some fun in return. Here is our proposal: - [1] Curators will get a new task: write a curation report for any post upvoted more than 50%, explaining why this post is a good post and the reasons behind the strong upvote. - [2] An algorithm will be designed by our one-man development team to track automatically those reports and assign them a score (on the basis of the level of details given in the report). - [3] The reports and scores will then be reviewed manually for a confirmation, manual curation being always yielding greater accuracy, by someone to whom this role will be assigned. - [4] The reports will be upvoted, as they are valuable for the SteemSTEM community, once the score will be confirmed. - [5] The best curator of the week will get a nice badge on his/her steemstem.io profile as well as an upvote-bonus for his/her own posts. Additionally, all-time tracking of these awards will also be maintained and made available on steemstem.io Moreover, due to the low volume of posts, we remove the rule enforcing a single author to get less than 3% of all SteemSTEM upvotes of the last two weeks (let’s simply reward the people still with us during these dark times). # Engagement and Honor Members We would also like to discuss engagement, or more specifically the lack of it. But before, let us focus on the SteemSTEM Honor Members a little bit. Honor Members are a class of trusted, motivated, high quality content creators who are symbolic of the very best of SteemSTEM. Out of that group mentors were chosen, whom users (new and old) could ask for help on the construction of content that better fit within the SteemSTEM guidelines. Our Honor Members and Mentors selflessly help others to create better content, and do this not for the rewards but because they see the potential of what we are trying to accomplish. They see where this community can go! In addition, a second subset of Honor Members were dedicated to track engagement and a third subset of them were focusing on dealing with the ‘questions-and-complaints‘ room of our discord server. However, the number of active users is in decline Steem wide, and with that the number of new content creators as well. So… a big part of the way that these respected community members were able to be involved, is just not currently available. Rather than sitting around and waiting for what once was to return, we propose a new direction and offer Honor Members new options to work with. In short: let us reward the good users instead of punishing the ones lacking of engagement. - [1] The Honour Members will be assigned the task of tracking and scoring the exemplary comments that are worthy to be rewarded. The information will be passed to our curation team for a SteemSTEM upvote. - [2] Our one-man development team will design a script tracking all rewarded comments and get some rankings. The top commenters will get an upvote-bonus for some their posts and comments, as well as a nice badge on their steemstem.io profile. There will be ‘levels’ to these badges and continued efforts will allow a user to improve their badge rank (and get more rewards). An all-time tracking will also be put in place. - [3] The Honour Members sub-categories will cease to exist. Every Honour Member will be asked to help how he/she can with the various missions. - [4] Both Honour Members and curators could optionally write reports to posts upvoted below 50%, explaining what could be improved. Those reports will be reviewed and upvoted. This will count for the “best curator” reward contest above-mentioned. This is where we stand for now. Feel free to let us know your thoughts.

Part 4: How can I get to the truth? This week let us begin with a continuation of @chappertron’s delightful ‘How to live healthy?’ series! The focus of this article revolves around statistics (I know, I know… you would’t think this is an interesting topic, but I assure you it is… in this post at least!!), which in our modern world is much more relevant to you than you might think! In this post @chappertron does a wonderful job illustrating some of the difficulties surrounding statistical analysis and interpretation of P-Values, P-hacking, and how perhaps Block Chain technology can play a role in helping! All done through the entertaining example of Steemit Vs. Facebook! Check it out! ### Through the Solar System - Venus Lets bring some Space back into the mix! Here @svemirac continues taking us ‘Through the Solar System’ in his series of the same name. The celestial body of focus is Venus! In this nice and brief post he takes us through some comparisons between Venus and our own Earth and also displays some available information with regards to the physical properties of the planet as determined by probes. Shoot on by and increase your space knowledge! Wednesday - Friday ### Logical Fallacies - Are you being manipulated (or manipulating) with bad arguments? Do you spend time arguing on the internet? If you do, you likely come across logical fallacies on a very regular basis (ad hominem, and post hoc ergo proctor hoc are exceedingly common). Spend some time reading this work by @zen-art to learn more about these manipulative, illogical arguments. Being able to better identify them in the statements of others, or even in yourself will help you become a more effective communicator of logical thought, and perhaps even a destroyer of poor logic on the web! ### Can we model the Neolithic transition with fossil pollen? Now we arrive at @samve and his wonderful post! He discusses some work using pollen in fossils to confirm the transition of humans in europe from a more hunter-gatherer society to a farming based one (neolithic). Never before this post have I found ancient pollen samples more interesting! Saturday - Sunday ### HIV prophylaxis Join @hitsug in learning about HIV and protecting yourself from exposure during sexual activities. As he succintly states to the question “How can I avoid HIV infection?” should not have to be “don’t have sex.” ### Let’s see what is deep inside of our body! What kind of effect calcium, sodium and potassium ions have? Let us end this week’s distilled with a text book quality biochemistry/cellular biology deep dive into the roles of calcium, sodium, and potassium in our bodies. In this post @anasav has put together a detailed depiction of a variety of biochemical pathways, and the respecive ion channels and proteins involved in the shuttling of these essential metal ions into and out of our cells. Check it out! A few words about the nomination process For some time, the editorial team behind this distilled series is made of a one-woman-team, @ruth-girl, and she chooses her favorite posts (potentially discussing with other curators and/or the management). Posts written by the SteemSTEM team are excluded from the nomination process. This week however, our one woman powerhouse needed a quick break. To facilitate this @justtryme90 stepped in and did his best to uphold the quality she puts forth on a weekly basis for you all. Please do not be discouraged if you did not make it on this issue. We are picking up in total 6 posts a week out of more than 150-200. The chances are thus low ;) In the meantime, you may wish to check these guidelines for extra tips on how your writing could be more effective. Authors upvoted by the SteemSTEM team In the spirit of being transparent about our actions that are now supported by @utopian-io, @curie, our delegators, our trailers and our manual curator supporters, we release every week the list of authors who have caught the attention of the @steemstem curation team. From November 26 to December 2, we rewarded X different authors who have written a total of Y different articles. The Z authors who received votes from @steemstem, potentially with either @utopian-io, @curie or both, are: Stats to be filled in upon availability of our stat-wizard.

This week let us begin with a post by @maticpecovnik discussing something that we all use quite frequently in our television, monitors and laptop screens! Liquid crystals! This post was created as an answer to a question on the STEEM based STEM question-and-answer platform stemQ, check it out! ### Ants: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Here we have a nice extensive post on an animal that has a collective mass which exceeds that of all humans on earth; the ant. Crawl on into this lovely work by @agmoore and learn something about one of the earth’s great builders. Wednesday - Friday ### What Movies Have Done Wrong Do you get annoyed at bad science in movies and TV? If you answer yes to that you are clearly of the same mind as our very own @conficker. In this post, @conficker goes into the details of some common mistakes that movie makers have made in their attempts to entertain us. Perhaps we need to watch them with a different mindset, accepting that the world of the movie is not reality! Nevertheless, take a gander into the work @conficker has provided for us here! ### How to Cope with Stress. (Part 5) Humor and Friends If you are anything like me, you are regularly under loads of stress! Coming up with effective mechanisms to cope isn’t always intuitive. Here @insight-out continues her well-done series on how to do just that. Read here about how something that people on the internet don’t have (friends) can help you cope with your stress. Saturday - Sunday ### Do not stay in the way of love between Magnesium and your body! :) This one is for all the divalent cation (M2+) lovers in the house. @zen-art takes us on a deep dive into the love between our bodies and Magnesium, a metal with a whole host of essential functions from allowing our muscles to move, to enabling the replication of our DNA. Eat your leafy greens and take some time to learn with @zen-art, ensure your body has the nutrients it needs to keep you happy and healthy. ### How to live healthy? Part 5: What should I do? Another week, another fantastic post by @chappertron. Here he finishes his series on how to live healthy, by summing up what we all need to do to keep our telomeres long (without upregulating telomerase and giving ourselves cancer :P). He also provides a nice background section on telomeres themselves! There have been a plethora of opportunities to learn from his series, and this conclusion is no exception, check it out!

Well, their tasks include searching for new STEM authors, evaluating and reviewing STEM articles, conducting thorough searches for plagiarism and they are the people who will suggest whether or not a STEM article has to be upvoted and supported by @steemstem. — A community gets bigger and stronger as its members work together, get to know each other, learn from each other. Evolve. Flourish. — ###### Introducing .. @lamouthe! — In this post @lamouthe is interviewed by @katerinaramm! With a passion about technology, nature, health, nature … @Lamouthe is one of the very respected persons in the steem blockchain and especially among the French Community! I am sure that many of you would like to know more about her so.. without any further due, let us get to know @Lamouthe a little bit better! If you have any extra questions or thoughts, feel free to let someone from the PR team know! ## Let’s shed some light! Q - Hi @LaMouthe, thank you for taking the time to reply to our questions! You are one of the very serious, pleasant and if I may say ‘Calm’ people of StemSTEM! Would you please let us know a few things about yourself: What is your real (first) name? What do you do, where are you from, how long have you been on Steem and what are your hobbies? A - My name is Emmanuelle. I come from a little village in the north of Montreal, in Quebec, and I finished my nursing training in 1999. In 2003, I went to work in Switzerland. There, I traveled a lot and met extraordinary people. At work, I did a special training in emergency care and a research work. I discovered how passionate my field was, how much I enjoy doing researches and also, how much I needed to understand the “how” of things! In the same period, I met @lemouth, a researcher in particule physics. — Q - How long have you been a language curator for SteemSTEM? A - I have been an official curator since this summer (2018), but I have been reading and looking for STEEM French articles for @lemouth for several months. He got tired of me spoiling his skype, so I became a curator. — — Q - Do you curate only French Posts? A - Actually, I do curation only for French-language articles. — Q - How and when did it all start? A - As I said, by spoiling the skype of @lemouth! — Q - What do the French-speaking authors prefer to write about? Are there significant differences in the topics chosen, between other nationalities and articles in English? A - There are actually very few French-speaking authors. One of our regular authors write about medical topics, a few others about technologies. We also have a few authors who are not “specialists” but very curious about almost everything and who write various kind of articles. — Q - What is the first thing that you take into consideration when curating? A - If the text is easy to read and with a “correct” French. Sometimes, “google translate” is NOT the best friend of authors… — Q - Tell us something that really gives you a great first impression when you see a SteemSTEM post. (It could have to do with the chosen topic, images, structure etc) A - The structure of the text is something I find very important. When there is no images, no paragraph splitting and just one big bloc of text, even if the topic is really interesting, I know it will be “hard” and painful to read… — Q - Do you have a favorite scientific topic that you have fun reading and reviewing over any others? Do you get a chance to read often about it? A - Since I am a nurse, the majority of topics related to health, medicine, psychology and biology will be of particular interest to me. Sadly, I don’t always have enought time to read as much as I would like about those topics in English… — Q - Tell us something that really makes you disappointed or angry when you see a SteemSTEM post. (It could have to do with the chosen topic, images, structure etc) A - Plagiarism!!! At first, I did not find this type of articles very quickly. I used to spend a lot of time reading articles that were often very interesting, checking out sources and discovering that it was just a copy-paste of a site or very awkward Wikipedia rewriting… So in the end, I was losing a lot time on authors who did not produce articles on their own. That was very frustrating! — Q - What would be your advice to both the old and new authors who wish to join SteemSTEM but do not know where to start? Do you have a channel for French Speaking STEM authors? A - I would have two advices. The first is to write about a subject that interests the author. It’s always more funny to read an article from an author who enjoyed and was passionate about writing it! The second advice concerns the length of the post: it has to be neither too long, nor too short. Usually between 1000 and 1500 words yields a post that reads well. Shorter posts are sometimes good enough, but often the subject has simply not been covered deeply enough. On the other hand, If it’s too long, either there are too many details, or it would be better to write several articles on the subject … We also have a discord server “francostem“ where people can ask their questions. Also, please do not hesitate to follow the (currently almost sleeping) @francostem blog. — — Q - Do you curate the French articles posted by @lemouth? A - In fact, it is rather him who does the double curation on French-speaking articles … including mine! But of course, when he posts in French, his articles are also supported by SteemSTEM. — — Q - Would you have any remarks to share regarding @lemouth’s scientific posts? Would you like to see different topics, or any changes in the formating of his posts? A - No, because his articles are very different from what is usually found in French. We understand that he is a true scientist who masters his subject. He also manages to popularize very complex subjects and it brings a real benefit to the French community. Many readers want more articles of this type, but there are few authors currently … — — Q - If you could interview anyone from SteemSTEM, who would it be and ask him/her one question now? A - @lemouth: What do you want to eat next week ? — Q - If you had more time to spare, how would you spend it? A - Write more frequently!!! And also, take time to read on topics I like… in English. — — Q - What does Science and SteemSTEM is to you? A - SteemSTEM consists in a way to discover science on the Internet with people capable of critical thinking. Today, we find plenty of informations and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the true from the false. With SteemSTEM, we have the opportunity to discover scientific articles of all levels and topics, but above all, to have the pros, cons and counter-opinions of other scientists … — — Q - Is there a great scientist that you really admire? And Why? A - euh… @lemouth again ? Because he is travelling so much! ;) — Q - Do you do any cool scientific experiments with your children? Have you thought of ways to make them get interested in science? A - I have already posted some articles about small experiences that I realized with our oldest son. He is a very curious child who likes to understand things in depth. We always try to help him satisfying his curiosity by searching with him the answers to his questions, no matter which topics he addresses. We also take every single opportunity to arouse his curiosity. There are also many museums for children, where they can touch everything and experiment the sciences with their senses and are great to awaken children to science … —- Q - If you could have any job in the world, what would you choose? A - Writing my posts on an island with wifi and pina colada!! — Q - Besides SteemSTEM, do you have any other steem related activities you would like to share? A - Actually, it is hard for me to find time to do anything else at the moment… — —- Q - What is your wish for SteemSTEM? A - That the SteemSTEM platform becomes big enough to be known by scientists from all over the world… — Q - Where do you see yourself in 5 years? A - About the same as now… but with more time for myself! — It was an honor to be able to interview @lamouthe and I sincerely would like to thank her from my heart for taking the time to answer my questions.

The project, founded 2.5 years ago, is now firmly marching towards its grand goal: allowing for the use of Steem as a science communication medium. Before summarizing all the team’s 2018 accomplishments, we wish all our contributors, supporters, honor members, benefactors and curators our best for the upcoming year. We will summarize below most of our efforts from 2018. This includes progress in building a STEM community on Steem, the development of our app, what we do in terms of curation and the deployment of our witness and seed nodes. Community building Science communication is a vital force worldwide, and we, at SteemSTEM, believe Steem has a significant role to play in this space through SteemSTEM. To that end we initially focused our attention toward building a community of science and STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) lovers on the Steem blockchain. By community, we consider both actual scientists that could use Steem to directly communicate about their work and state-of-the-art research, as well as passionate STEM enthusiasts that could share their knowledge freely and enthusiastically view and engage with experts and amateur content creators alike. We believe that Steem can offer STEM professionals and enthusiasts a social media environment that actively promotes and supports them, through SteemSTEM, without having to rely on any middlemen (like journalists) who interpret raw information and oftentimes introduce inaccuracies. Steem would hence be a primary source of STEM information for mainstream audiences! In order achieve this goal, SteemSTEM has started to increase our visibility outside Steem and its community. Information needs to be widely spread and we therefore regularly advertise our actions and specific STEM posts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. We moreover regularly organize meetups in top-notch science places like CERN or Virgo Labs. The steemstem.io app Shortly after the summer break, we released our new open source app, steemstem.io, that we believe will become a valuable tool for STEM lovers and researchers to communicate and share information. Our app is a full interface to Steem, and allows one to undertake any standard action that should be done from a Steem interface. This in particular includes the option to set beneficiaries to a post and to directly delegate some SP to another account. It chronologically displays English posts carrying the #steemstem tag and approved by the SteemSTEM curation team. The language requirement can be modified (we support the Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Slavic languages providing each sub-community their own custom trending pages), and extra category filters (math, physics, …) can be enforced. The curation requirement can also be removed by the simple click of a button. Our app finally offers extra exposure to our whitelisted authors and post promotion in the top banner can be purchsed by anyone. There are still many features to implement before moving away from the beta version of the app, but the to-do list has been reduced by a lot thanks to our one-person development wizard. In Q1 2019, we plan to continue working out this list, as well as to introduce gamification within the app. We for instance aim to track the best users in terms of engagement, and reward them with a stronger post support and new tokens of appreciations. More details will follow in the coming weeks. STEM support on Steem and curation Our curation team searches for original and quality content posted on Steem and related to all STEM fields in seven languages (Chinese, English, French, Italian, German, Slavic and Spanish) through our support to several sub-communities (cn-stem, de-stem, francostem, itastem, stemng, stem-espanol and yu-stem). Curators decide on the voting strength applied for each qualifying post, this reccomendation is then re-affirmed by a separte curator. Upvotes could be small (5%: encouragement or motivation), medium (20%: informative post on a given topic), standard (65%: post going beyond what could be found elsewhere) or high (100%: information on state-of-the-art research generally not available anywhere else). Upvotes by the @steemstem account additionally trigger, under certain conditions (usually the best posts), a voting trail consisting of other initiatives like @curie or @utopian-io, as well as generous support from independent curators. Within this scheme, getting higher support corresponds to bringing something to Steem that cannot be found anywhere else (cutting-edge science, novel and/or non-standard way of presenting a topic, etc.). On different lines, SteemSTEM has started to build a repository of open-source images that could be requested by authors and used in STEM posts. This initiative, called stem-art, is supported by the SteemSTEM project. We make sure contributing artists are provided a reward for their work. The picture below summarizes the number of posts and authors that we support since the creation of the project. In these hard times (let’s say the last three months), the SteemSTEM community includes on a more or less stable basis about 75 authors who write a total of about 100 posts each week. Taking the entire 2018 year into account, SteemSTEM supported 1341 unique authors who wrote 9906 posts. Witness and node SteemSTEM is also proud to play a role in maintaining the Steem blockchain through the deployment of a witness (@stem.witness) and a seed node (seed.steemstem.io:2001) during the last quarter of 2018.

Well, their tasks include searching for new STEM authors, evaluating and reviewing STEM articles, conducting thorough searches for plagiarism and suggesting whether or not a STEM article should be upvoted and supported by @steemstem. — A community gets bigger and stronger as its members work together, get to know each other, learn from each other. — ## Introducing @carloserp-2000! — In this post @carloserp-2000 is interviewed by @kingabesh! A man with a passion for STEM in general but with a bit more flair for the physics of semiconductor compounds in particular. Carloserp-2000 is definitely a man we all look forward to knowing. If you have any extra questions or thoughts, feel free to let someone from the PR team know! ## Let’s Go On With That! Q - Hi Carloserp-2000, thank you for taking the time to reply to our questions! You are one of the very serious industrious people of StemSTEM! Would you please let us know a few things about yourself: What is your real (first) name? What do you do, where are you from, how long — Hello kingabesh my name is Carlos Pagnini. I am from a small town in the Venezuelan Andes. I studied at a prestigious University in my country, specifically the University of Zulia. Currently I work as a researcher, although I do not have much work at the moment. I have about 1 year and a half on Steem, I discovered it thanks to some friends of the University. I like to play sports, I am a soccer fan and the rest of the time I try to share as much as possible with my little daughter Sophi. Q - How long have you been a language curator for SteemSTEM? A - I started in January 2018 with the birth of the Spanish-speaking sub-community (@stem-espanol) — — Q - Do you curate only Spanish language posts? A - Yes, I’m only in charge of checking the publications in Spanish. — Q - How and when did it all start? A - At the end of 2017 I sent a DM to @mobbs and asked if there was the possibility of creating a Spanish-speaking sub-community, because there was a large community of users, and he immediately responded that the idea was very good. He got in touch with @justtryme90 and @lemouth to get their opinions on my proposal. After a few weeks, I received a response and we started the conversations for about 3 weeks. They told me I needed a co-worker. After much planning, STEM-Espanol was founded. — Q - What do the Spanish-speaking authors prefer to write about? Are there significant differences in the topics chosen, between other nationalities and articles in English? A - Sincerely, it is a very varied community, most of the posts are medicine, chemistry and engineering. Although we also have some very good authors in math, biology and of course physics. The difference with the publications of other nationalities is significant, the authors of STEM-Espanol use a very technical-scientific language, that’s a positive thing, but I always recommend that they try to write as digestibly as possible, so that readers can understand the content. And this advice has been useful! — Q - What is the first thing that you take into consideration when curating? A - Unique content, easy to read. With the time I have been a curator, I already know many respected users, most of them are scientists with doctorates, they always write about the area in which they work and they are great articles. Necessarily, the post should not be about any experiment or field work, it can be a personal interpretation of any specific topic. That is why any author can be encouraged to write in STEM as long as their content meets the established standards. — Q - Tell us something that really gives you a great first impression when you see a SteemSTEM post. (It could have to do with the chosen topic, images, structure, lay-out etc) A - The title of the post is very important, a good title calls your attention. Immediately after clicking on the publication, I check the images if they have their licenses and the references at the end of the publication. For me, grammar and spelling are very important, if a publication has flaws with accentuation and spelling errors, I lose interest immediately. Spanish is complicated, but there are many corrective text programs that can help users. And as I mentioned in the previous question, it is important to understand a publication, to have fun reading its content. The idea is to convey the message to a wide audience, it is fabulous when a doctor understands a publication about physics. This translates into a great reward for the author. — Q - Do you have a favorite scientific topic that you have fun reading and reviewing over any others? Do you get a chance to read often about it? A - I like publications on pure sciences, physics, chemistry and mathematics. But I love learning new things, lately I’m reading a lot about medicine and I’ve known fabulous subjects. When a publication is well written that does not come from Wikipedia and the content is perfectly transmitted I am HAPPY. — Q - Tell us something that really makes you disappointed or angry when you see a SteemSTEM post. (It could have to do with the chosen topic, images, structure etc) A - I think all the curators are bothered by plagiarism, and I’m no exception! However when a subject is very good and interesting and the author does not work enough to provide good content, that is disappointing! The authors must take advantage of the content and convey their ideas, they must stop being something peresozos and work harder. — Q - What would be your advice to both the old and new authors who wish to join SteemSTEM but do not know where to start? Do you have a channel for Spanish Speaking STEM authors? A - For the ancients, they should continue to publish excellent content, although it is always important to renew so that the readers at some point do not feel bored. For new ones, share content with which you feel familiar, things that you love, that you master perfectly. Also perseverance and humility is important. Many new authors get upset because their articles are not supported and they begin to criticize our work, without first asking what they are failing and how they can improve. We have our official channel in discord https://discord.gg/Fef7p2m where you can go and share your concerns with the curators and collaborators, they can help you improve. They can also talk about any specific topic and have fun interacting healthily. — — Q - What is the meaning of your username and if i may ask, why does it have 2000 attached to it? A - After my name are the initials of my middle name and my two surnames. The 2000 is the name of the favorite video game store, I spent hours playing, my mother very upset, always went to the store to find me because I had to go home to do my homework from school hehehe :P. — — Q - The physics of semiconductor compounds. Can you throw more light on this? Maybe let us know why you find this worth researching and writing on ? A - It is a very broad and interesting field of physics. In particular I enjoy conducting experiments with semiconductors always looking for new results that can be translated into future applications. In my country we have excellent professionals in the area always looking for new compounds that help us solve problems such as electricity. We all know that renewable energies are the future and semiconductors play an essential role in these energies. — — Q - If you could interview anyone from SteemSTEM, who would it be and ask him/her one question now? A - @justtryme90 and @mobbs … when will they show their faces?. :P — — Q - If you had more time to spare, how would you spend it? A - Touring all the countries of europe visinting the soccer stadiums. :D — — Q - What does Science and SteemSTEM mean to you? A - Curiosity, predict, decipher and check. In that order for me is the meaning of science. Without science in my life everything would be boring, everything would be wrong. Is my motivation is a fundamental pillar with my daughter. — — Q - Is there a great scientist that you really admire? Why? A - There are many but especially Stephen Hawking that despite his illness, had the desire to continue contributing to science - it was his great motivation to live. — —- Q - If you could have any job in the world, what would you choose? A - Being a footballer is my frustrated dream because I was very good at playing, but a serious injury interrupted my career and a new love was born, “La Fisica”. — — Q - Besides SteemSTEM, do you have any other Steem-related activities you would like to share? A - Not really, I’m totally committed to SteemSTEM. — —- Q - What is your greatest wish for SteemSTEM? A - We all want, that the project continues to grow and that more users can share their knowledge on this platform. — Q - Where do you see SteemSTEM in 5 years? A - As a consolidated project, famous in all the Universities of the world, where each professional and student from different areas of science contribute their knowledge. — It was an honor interviewing @carloserp-2000 and I would like to sincerely thank him for finding time to answer my questions.

Here he breaks down correlation maps, which are commonly observed in molecular dynamics publications. It’s pretty mathy, a bit intense, but a very well done depiction of a complex topic! Check it out and expand your mind. ### GENETIC DISORDER THAT TRANSFORMS AN INDIVIDUAL INTO A DISNEY PRINCESS Have you ever dreamed of having the big beautiful eyes of a disney princess? Well we have just the article for you that will ruin that desire! :D Check out this nice piece by @yhubi where he discusses Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, a genetic disorder which can give you all the disney princess characteristics you could/should (n)ever want! Wednesday - Friday ### The biology and physics of wound healing Let’s move on to another wonderful piece by @scienceblocks. Last week we highlighted a post where scienceblocks discussed wound healing, which can leave a scar. This week we visit a work talking about a scarring disease, fibrosis. Dive on in to this detailed and well constructed article, we can assure you that your fibroblasts will enjoy your increased understanding. ### Sex and the Sexes: Talking Past Each Other Next we have a post by @alexander.alexis which discusses a bit of scientific romance (or lack there of) if you will. The post dives into the ways that people communicate about sex, and how that communcation differs between men and women. Give a read through, you might find out something you didnt know about how your partner communicates, or maybe even your self. Saturday - Sunday ### Geometric Sequences: The Geometric Mean You know what we never have enough of in our distilled posts? Math. You know what we have this week? A nice live DTube math lesson on Geometric Mean by @masterwu. A concept that you might remember from your undergraduate calculus course, (or if you are like me, a concept that it would appear you have forgotten from said class! shame on me.) Math is like fruits and vegetables for your brain, it helps you grow big and ~~strong~~ smart! ### Why did humans evolve to lose most of their hair? Finally we will be closing this edition with a post created for the stemQ.io platform with a little double @scienceblocks feature action. Here we learn about why humans evolved to lose most of our body hair! I can with 100% honesty say that going into this post my hair knowledge was really not very good. However now having read it, my life has forever been changed! I am now much more versed in the ways of the hair. Have your own ~~hair~~ life changing moment, give this work a read!

This week we begin with the next installment of @roguescientist84 ‘s series about bringing an old trasmission electron microscope back to life. The post is peppered with tidbits of knowledge about setting up and running a lab grade electron microscope including but not limited to: preventing condensation on the lense, what the internal workings of a vaccum gauge look like, and much more. This isn’t something you get to see every day so take a moment and check it out! ### Mad Cow Disease: What Causes It? When you hear the name Mad Cow disease… what image comes to mind? Is it a really pissed off cow? If it is then you should really read this great post put together by @agmoore. Here we get taken on a trip through the various reasons that actually cause a brain to begin to resemble swiss cheese (lots of holes!) Prion’s are no joke and neither is how good this post is. Check it out! Thursday - Sunday ### 2018 in science: from gene-edited babies to cube shaped poo (+ predictions for 2019) Next we have @zen-art and her 2018 recap! What can we say about this post other than wow! A jam packed information bonanza about some of the years most interesting stories! From an icy lake on mars to editing the genes of human babies 2018 was a fast paced year full of many scientific developments (some good, some bad depending on your personal perspective!) Check out this post, who knows what you might have missed!! ### Nuclear Power in Hong Kong Lets now take a trip to Hong Kong and dive into a nice discussion about Guangdong Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station. Complete with some of the basics of the production of how nuclear energy is produced @kenchung goes into both the benefits and drawbacks of this sort of energy complete with some thoughts and opinions on the subject. This may be just the inspiration you need to think about this powersource in your own area. ### A crucial time for the Ebola response effort in The Congo Next we stop by a post by @nonzerosum where he discusses the response effort in the Congo in dealing with the hemmorhagic fever ‘Ebola.’ This post dives into the numbers keeping us informed on the toll that this disease is playing there (356 confirmed deaths to date in the most recent outbreak!) He goes on to discuss the difficulties faced by the meager healthcare system there, and the effects of distrust of the countries government on how this disease is able to spread.

Follow the next steps and see him get closer to Reviving a Vintage Transmission Electron Microscope! ### Are you really using only 10% of your brain? One of the most famous scientific myths is brought under the microscope by @zen-art. Are we taking advantage only of the 1/10 of our full brain capacity? Can we get a “memory upgrade”? Well, @zen-art has written a great post to let us know us more about it! ### The Horsehead Nebula | Walk For Science An interesting “photoshooting” comes in the next post.

You are quite a character on StemSTEM! An interesting one if I must say. Would you please let us know a few things about yourself: What is your real (first) name? What do you do, where are you from ? A - First, let me express my gratitude to the entire PR team for presenting me with this opportunity to talk about myself. My name is Shaid, I currently work as an Assistant Lecturer in one of the private Universities in Nigeria – Department of Biological Sciences to be precise. I hailed from Ile-Ife, an ancient town in South-western Nigeria that is generally believed by some Historians to be the source of human civilization. I studied Botany both at undergraduate and postgraduate level with specialization in plant ecology. I have an undiluted passion towards scientific research, especially when it relates to the environment and the ecosystem at large. I play scrabble and chess leisurely and also am social media savvy. I am used to people referring to me as a special character and I am quite sure it is due to my simple, happy-go-lucky nature and the strong stance I always take on fairness and justice. — — Q - How long have you been a language curator for SteemSTEM? A - I started curating for steemstem in December 2017. Not a fan of Mathematics but that should be about a year plus. — — Q - Do you curate only posts from Nigerian authors? A - Yes. That is what the mandate I was given says. I am a Nationality curator and I stick to my niche. — Q - How and when did it all start? A - It all started when I joined Steemit (of course it has to be, right?) on the 14th of November, 2017. Just like almost every n00b would do, I spent the first few days posting random stuff and spamming tags. However, due to my penchant for reading and accumulating knowledge, I stumbled on the SteemSTEM tag and from one of the articles, I got the link to join the community on steemit.chat. I had very little trouble in getting my first SteemSTEM curation due to my inherent science inclination and the knowledge accrued from reading and chatting in the community. Needless to say, about 90% of the random stuff I was posting was science-related even before discovering the SteemSTEM tag. My posts were not just getting voted by SteemSTEM but also attracting attention in the comment section. Around December 2017 when steemit.chat was acting up and the community was gradually moving to discord, @justtryme90 approached, briefed me about the blueprint of SteemSTEM and asked if I would like to help out albeit on a voluntary basis. I needed no second invitation. Here I am today  — Q - What do the Nigerian authors prefer to write about? Are there significant differences in the topics chosen, between articles by authors from other nationalities and articles by Nigerians? A - This is rather an ambiguous question but I think I have an idea of what you mean. To address the first part, I cannot categorically say that this is what Nigerians like writing about. They will write just about anything and do a good job at it just as you will see them excel in numerous places around the world. I also do not think Nigerian STEM writers are different from any other stem writer on the STEEM blockchain irrespective of the country. The only thing that makes us different is perhaps the population and the frequency of posting which we seem to have more of than any other sub-group in the community. Nigerians work hard, there is no doubt. — Q - What is the first thing that you take into consideration when curating? A - Facts, originality and relatability (permit me to use that word). Science articles should be about tested facts and not some pseudoscience mumbo jumbo. In the same vein, this is a blogging platform and an average educated reader should be able to relate to any blog article to a particular extent. A factual but relatable article would attract engagement, rank in high in search and attract more people to the platform than some hardcore science with zero engagement. —– Q - Tell us something that really gives you a great first impression when you see a SteemSTEM post. (It could have to do with the chosen topic, images, structure, lay-out etc) — A - The writing style. I love it when a writer can use good communication skill and entertaining language to discuss scientific topics. Blogging is a combination of education and entertainment. If I feel like consuming hardcore science articles, I will visit research-gate or other similar platforms. — Q - Do you have a favorite scientific topic that you have fun reading and reviewing over any others? Do you get a chance to read often about it? A - I love anything about the environment and climate change. Unfortunately, not many of those are on here. — Q - Tell us something that really makes you disappointed or angry when you see a SteemSTEM post. (It could have to do with the chosen topic, images, structure etc) A - Blatant plagiarism. I use the word ‘blatant’ because some supposed plagiarisms are debatable and it seems plagiarism means different things to different people depending on their training. — Q - What would be your advice to both the old and new authors who wish to join SteemSTEM but do not know where to start? Do you have a channel for nigerian STEM authors? A - My advice would be for them to join the SteemSTEM community on discord, learn about what it takes to craft acceptable SteemSTEM article, request for mentorship as the honour members are always ready to help and above all, do not be in a hurry to turn out STEM posts and avoid plagiarism at all cost. There is a STEMng discord server for Nigerian STEM authors and the door is opened to anyone that wishes to relate with us. — — Q - What is the meaning of your username and are you as gentle as your name implies ? A - It is a combination of ‘gentleness’ and my first name. Gentility might be relative but most people I have been across generally agree that I am gentle. — — Q - You have shown, countlessly, your love towards the environment and our ecosystem at large. Can you let us know why you feel this way towards our environment and possibly suggest simple ways we can, perhaps, save our environment? Highlight ways we may be ignorantly destroying our environmnet too, if that so pleases you? :) A - Humans are a microcosm of the environment and a lot of our activities are destroying what we are part of. Hence, it’s like we are destroying ourselves. All hands must be on deck to save the environment in order to save the future generation and preserve the planet. A lot of our activities directly or indirectly lead to the emission of greenhouse gases, destruction of the forest cover, plastic and other forms of pollution. Everyone should have the consciousness of the environment in their minds and live an eco-friendly lifestyle. Barring the uneducated folks, almost everyone know the anthropogenic activities that are injurious to the environment. For every paper you use, know that a tree was removed in the forest for it. Such a tree could have fixed tons of carbon dioxide annually and help in the mitigation of climate change. If you are keen about saving the environment, you can start by using as little paper as possible. It’s the least of all the things you can do. — — Q - If you could interview anyone from SteemSTEM, who would it be and ask him/her one question now? A - That would be @zest. Where within the galaxy are you? — — Q - If you had more time to spare, how would you spend it? A - Doing real-life research, spending time on the STEEM blockchain and with my family. — — Q - What does Science and SteemSTEM mean to you? A -Science means the world and everything it contains. SteemSTEM is a platform that leverages on the incentives opportunity on the steem blockchain to promote scientific facts (in an easily digestible way) as opposed to junks of pseudoscience that seem to fill a large space on the internet. — — Q - Is there a great scientist that you really admire? Why? A - I’ve never really thought of this but now that you are asking, I think I like Darwin. His keen sense of observation is enviable as shown by the report of his expedition. — —- Q - If you could have any job in the world, what would you choose? A - A researcher with an unlimited resources. — — Q - Besides SteemSTEM, do you have any other Steem-related activities you would like to share? A - I am deeply involved with @promo-mentor where I mentor newbies that are interested in producing STEM contents on the steem blockchain. I am one of the Nigerian ambassadors to @fundition, a peer-to-peer crowdfunding platform on STEEM. In the last few months, my interest in technological and innovative products has been piqued, thanks to @steemhunt. — —- Q - What is your greatest wish for SteemSTEM? A - To be at the forefront of promoting STEEM to the world among all the STEEM dapps. — Q - Where do you see SteemSTEM in 5 years? A - As one of the topmost tokenized platforms to disseminate/consume factually informative, interesting as well as entertaining scientific contents — It was an honor interviewing @gentleshaid and I would like to sincerely thank him for finding time to answer my questions.

We hence support about 100 of these posts, and present in this distilled our top 6 handpicked choices for the last week. Monday - Wednesday Trekking Tech - Basic Hydration @gra and his valuable lessons of “survival” will open this week. Read a great post on how to get your valuable water, when the supplies you carry have run out. You never know how useful this will be to you some day! A compilation of information on alternative medicine: how anticancer drugs can be produced in yeast, a new tea plant with low caffeine naturally, potential antidote for botulism. Another interesting and well-written post is here by @diamondmind. Alternative medicine and ways to treat serious conditions without the use of synthetic drugs are described in this post. Won’t you give it a read? Thursday - Sunday EVERY CHILD HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A GENIUS Every kid may evolve into a great mind and @yhubi discusses the topic very well in this post. This piece revolves around dyslexia and helps us understand a few basics and see that people coping with it are not of lower intelligence nor do they deserve our disapproval. Observing the Earth’s Curvature Someone has come back with a wonderful post on the curvature of our planet. This someone is our astrophotographer, @terrylovejoy! Don’t miss the chance to find more arguments to stand a fight with a flat-earther :P Turning up the Electron Beam on an Electron Microscope @roguescientist84 will close this issue with a dtube video. Have you been following the series “Reviving a Vintage Transmission Electron Microscope”? Then watch what happens when the electron beam is turned on! A few words about the nomination process This week’s distilled highlights were selected by @ruth-girl. She is back yet again to save us from picks by @justtryme90 (Eww… Gross Right?). Again she provides us her sharp, coherent, and kindhearted picks and description! Thank you Ruth! Please do not be discouraged if you did not make it on this issue.

Whether you are an amateur STEM blogger or STEM professional, you are likely very aware of the value that a good image brings when assembling a publication. The STEM-Art project looks to provide you with a way to have unique images generated according to your specific requirements - be that for your personal blog or for a scholarly publication/text book/lecture materials/etc, at no cost to you! By connecting STEM enthusiasts directly with artists, we can turn a request into a visual reality. However, there is one requirement for the art commissioning and generation process: Use of this service requires that the image generated be released to the public under a Creative Commons BY 4.0 license. This license ensures that everyone who would like to use the image in the future can do so - at no cost to them. This initiative is a win for the requesting user; they get a high quality, unique image for their upcoming work at no cost to themselves. It’s a win for the artist; they get to continue to build their body of work and receive a STEEM reward. It’s a win for users of the future; they now have access to one more high quality image that may benefit their works as well. You’re going to get tired of all the winning! # How do I Commission a Work and What are the Rules? Works can be commissioned through direct communication with available artists in the #stem-art room in the SteemSTEM Discord Channel. Individuals who would like to commission an image should make a request for an artist to contact them via DM and give instructions on their expected time frame, image details and more. The artist then gets to work creating the commissioned image, which must include the steemstem.io watermark: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/453677607704068116/509004789271625739/sponsored_by_steemstem.png The SteemSTEM.io watermark must be added to all requested images in order to receive support from this initiative. The watermark at minumum should be set to 50% transparency and included in the image (as illustrated in most of the images here). The included SteemSTEM watermark must have at minimum the following dimensions (Dimensions). In addition to the inclusion of the watermark, participants in this initiative accept that their image will be released to the public under a Creative Commons BY 4.0 license and included in @steemstem’s compendium of open source images, which can be accessed here. Upon completion of the work and publication of a STEEM post (requirements described below), the artist places a link to the post in the discord chat for curation by the SteemSTEM team, and notifies the requester that their image is ready. That’s all there is to it! How does the Work get Paid For?Requests commissioned by users of the STEM-Art project will be published by the artist on the STEEM blockchain in a post displaying the work, indicating its release under the Creative Commons BY 4.0 license, and will include the #stem-art tag. The steemSTEM team highly reccomends that the artist set a 5% beneficiary status to @steemstem as well as an additional 5% beneficiary status to the requesting users steem account (beneficiaries can easily be added to any post published with https://www.steemstem.io). The artist’s post will then be supported by @steemstem for their work generating the open-access STEM based image. Additional gratitude can be shown by the requester in the form of a STEEM/SBD tip to the artist as well if they so wish. What Are The Long Term Goals of STEM-Art?Long term, STEM-Art seeks to bring additional attention to STEEM through building an open-access database of public domain images, similar to what we have with sites such as https://www.pixabay.com, but with an emphasis on images with a STEM subject matter. We feel that the unique properties of the STEEM blockchain enable us to ensure generation of a large volume of high-quality images, which can be released freely for public consumption/use while simultaneously providing a reward to the artists who showcase their talents in the works, as well as serve as long term advertising for the blockchain. Any interested Artists who would like to join the STEM-art project please feel free to reach out to the management team on the steemSTEM discord chat.

Monday - Wednesday Animal Series #18: A Natural Born Superhero @chloroform wrote us a nice post on ~~human-eaters~~ great white sharks and their wonderful genetic material (that make them perfect target for pseudoscience). Sharks are also very good in using electric impulses to detect food, and the female ones can even mate without a male. Don’t hesitate to read the post to additionally know how to behave as bad human food and be ignored by sharks! Thursday - Sunday The Rosette Nebula | Walk for Science @astrophoto.kevin presents us amazing shoots of the Rosette Nebula that is located some 5000 light years away from us. His amazing telscope+camera apparatus did well (a picture of it has also been shared), and he is sharing with us a few pictures. Our Food Is Radioactive!! Did you know we are facing radioactivity everytime we eat banana? This is true, but radioactivity is much more than just one of the phenomenon occuring when bananas are eaten. @medro-martin offers us here a very nice and comprehensive review.

Monday - Thursday (first half) Developing a Developmental Biology Lab – Roundabout Sex Determination SteemSTEM proudly supports @tking77798 and his project of designing lab classes in developmental biology (and publishinh them on SteemSTEM). Today, he is not discussing placenta eating at all (yes, this is a thing… apparently…), but how to make use of DNA and a placenta to determine the sex of a child. Practical Astronomy - Measuring the distance to the moon If you are not a big fan of playing with blood, maybe is astronomy a better topic four you. @terrylovejoy started to design a series of practical astronomy lessons. Once again, SteemSTEM is proud to fully support this initiative. In the lecture of last week, you will learn how to measure easily (more or less :p) the distance to the moon (without getting there)! Thursday (second half) - Sunday Could the Formosan clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa brachyura) still be extant in the dense jungles of Taiwan? Is the Formosan clouded leopard really extinct. I would say yes, but this is not what everybody thinks. What is your opinion on this topic? if you do not have any, feel free to read this post from @valth in which you will get more information first on the animal itself, and second on the origins of there rumours. Being Diagnosed With Lung Cancer; Wait A Minute, I’m Not A Smoker?! One of the most frequent cancer yielding death is definitely lung cancer. This holds for smokers of course, but not only. Everyone in the same basket here. And this is the intriguing fact @n4zrizulkafli is after, trying to find some correlations in the numbers. Statistics Statistics are still busy.

Consequently (good luck finding the correlation), today is the perfect day to share with you some updates about the SteemSTEM project. We have been pretty quiet these days but things are always moving on behind the scenes. This posts consists of a short update (a longer update will come later this season). Let’s go straight to the points we will discuss: Use our app to interact with the SteemSTEM community (and get rewarded) The distilled is back, and stats will reappear hopefully in a week (and we won’t discuss this further) SteemSTEM is happy to open up several curator positions About steemstem.io We are happy to announce that besides very busy agendas, the steemstem.io development team has managed to build additional new features to our app steemstem.io. In particular, the currently deployed version 0.7 (and almost finalized) allows for a much better user experience: articles/comments can be posted and edited easily and straightforwardly, markdown is fully supported and post/comment editing works out of the box. With this in hand, we hope steemstem.io will become the best vector for enhancing interactions among all STEM users of the Steem blockchain. To motivate the usage of our app (and also to somehow call for additional beta-testers), SteemSTEM is already supporting any author using the app to post an article more strongly (with an automatic 5% stronger upvote). Starting today, the best comments posted from the app will also be rewarded. While spam comments will be automatically ignored, any other comment contributing to debates and interactions among SteemSTEM members will be upvoted with a strength varying between 2% and 5%. Whilst an algorithm pre-selecting the comments is already in place, the final voting will of course be manual. A special note to our honour members: as you are among the most engaged SteemSTEM members, you will get a slightly stronger upvote every time one of your steemstem.io posted comments is selected, as a bonus and a thank you for all that you bring to our community. Join the best curation team in the world SteemSTEM curation is a hard job. Not only does the SteemSTEM tag have to be scoured, but also all STEM-related tags like physics, chemistry, virus, biology and engineering. Curators read those posts, assess whether and how they should be voted, confirm the voting proposals of other curators and finally cast confirmed votes. In addition, our curation team is in charge of our distilled series and to support our various sub-communities. If you are interested in such a job, feel free to apply by commenting this post and letting us know, in 4-5 lines, why this job should be given to you. It should be made clear that this is a mostly voluntary position. Although we can provide a small ‘less-than-a-coffee‘ tip each week and permit more voting flexibility for one’s own posts (though, no self-voting), the main drive is not financial but inspirational; we at SteemSTEM are all part of a unique project supporting science and the Steem blockchain!

A man who writes just about anything. From his witty titles to his interesting pieces of writing to his awesome feedback on posts on the Steem ecosystem, @greenrun is an author we all look forward to reading. In that same sense, an interview with greenrun should be something to look forward to. If you have any extra questions or thoughts, feel free to let someone from the PR team know! Let’s Get On With It! Q - Hi greenrun, thank you for taking time to reply to our questions! You are quite an enigma on the blockchain so that subtly makes you a charater we all look forward to knowing. Thus, we begin this session by asking; What is your real (first) name? What do you do, where are you from ? A - Well, I go by the name of Green Run, and I think it is as real as it gets. I am from Nigeria, a country that is made up of 190 million people and things, with loads of good people. It has its quirks and all, and one of which is the identity politics (which fortunately I am not going to delve further in on it) which makes me retain Green Run as my name as I am 100% detribalised Nigerian. Q - How long have you been a language curator for SteemSTEM? A - I got a private message in steem chat on December 21, 2017, from @justtryme90 asking if I’d like to be a language curator for STEM for the Nigeria community. Let us just say I jumped at the offer and it has been a rollercoaster ride of fun and learning experience. Q - Do you curate only posts from Nigerian authors? A - Yes and no. I curate majorly on the STEM contents from Nigeria. In the off chance, there is none I can also curate other worthwhile posts from non-Nigerian writers. Q - How and when did it all start? A - Just like I mentioned above, I got a Steem chat message from one of the founders of SteemSTEM - @justtryme90 - to join the team as curator for the Stemng, a Nigeria sub-community. He said he was impressed by both my content and other Nigerian contributors. I joined. Q - What do the Nigerian authors prefer to write about? Are there significant differences in the topics chosen, between articles by authors from other nationalities and articles by Nigerians? A - The Nigerian communities are very diverse in the content they put out. I guess we have a mixed bunch of talented STEM community which makes it hard for me to put my hand on any particular topic of preference which they output. Q - What is the first thing that you take into consideration when curating? A - I check on first if the content is original and then whether it is worth supporting- is it a genuine claim or just some hogwash. If you write original content on why the earth is flat, no matter how authentic the writing is since we already know the earth is not flat, such an article is guaranteed not going to be curated. Q - Tell us something that really gives you a great first impression when you see a SteemSTEM post. (It could have to do with the chosen topic, images, structure, lay-out etc) A - The writing style, yes it is STEM content, but no one really loves a boring post no matter how valid the subject of discussion is. Q - Do you have a favorite scientific topic that you have fun reading and reviewing over any others? Do you get a chance to read about it often ? A - I think I may be more fascinated by topics that have to do with renewable energy or any breakthrough in technology that finds a more efficient way to do things. Yeah, I read a lot about renewable energy that you can call me a RE fanatic Q - Tell us something that really makes you disappointed or angry when you see a SteemSTEM post. (It could have to do with the chosen topic, images, structure etc) A - Blatant copy and paste spoils the mood of every curator as it is the same as theft of intellectual property which some unscrupulous writers do not see as something not worth doing. Q - What would be your advice to both the old and new authors who wish to join SteemSTEM but do not know where to start? Do you have a channel for Nigerian STEM authors? A - I recommend that both new and old members should not give up. Even if there is little or no engagement on their article published to keep pushing until they are noticed. People will always notice genuine hard work any day, even though it may take longer than we anticipated. Yes, we do have a discord channel which anyone can join. Here is the link Q - What is the meaning of your username and why did the word “greenrun” appeal to you ? A - The meaning of the name is simple, we associate green to things that are going awesomely well. Even in the crypto space nobody hates a green candle unless of course, you are short :) I am a fan of renewable energy too which is often referred to as green energy. We all quest for a greener future- one with less pollution and less carbon footprint. Also, I am a 100% Nigerian and green is one of the National Symbol, one which you can clearly see in the flag :) Q - **You have a knack for writing on diverse topics and even sometimes, the unconventional ones. What inspires you to piece together these articles ? Have you always had a passion for science blogging or did you just discover that through steemstem ? A - Well, I have wanted to be a writer since I could read. I like writing and because I also have an engineering background writing about science seems to come rather easy. Q - When it comes to theoretical physics, Do you consider anyone greater than Albert Einstein ? If yes, why ? A - His general theory of relativity is a significant scientific contribution. Though some say without the groundworks of scientists like Galileo and Newton that Einstein may be left in a lurch. While not in any way downplaying the roles of these great scientists, Einstein did indeed provide an excellent way of looking at the universe. As Newton humbly acknowledged, “[We] see far because [we] stand on the shoulders of giants.” Q - If you could interview anyone from SteemSTEM, who would it be and ask him/her one question now? A - It will have to @mobbs. I will only ask one question which is, “when do you get to sleep?” :) Q - If you had more time to spare, how would you spend it? A - I spend my free time writing short stories and wondering why the sky is blue. Q - What does Science and SteemSTEM mean to you? A - It is an avenue to share exciting news and stories from the STEM community and making STEM more fun instead of the dreary nerds and uptight people they often portray those in STEM fields as. Q - Who are your top 3 favourite scientists and why are they so ? A - Elon Musk, Elon Musk, and Elon Musk. Yeah, I know I mentioned him three times that is just to show how much of a fan that I am. He represents everything excellent in scientists, he and his group are consistently looking at ways to make mankind and living more wholesome. From his SpaceX space exploration to his Tesla EV cars and renewable systems, he is sure showing a lot of sceptics that things could be done better. Q - If you could have any job in the world, what would you choose? A - To be a chocolate taster who gets paid a humongous amount of money to taste chocolates! Q - Besides SteemSTEM, do you have any other Steem-related activities you would like to share? A - For now, I’m all in on SteemSTEM, it is a ride-or-die relationship :) Q - What is your greatest wish for SteemSTEM? A - To be the next quora where people looking for answers on STEM contents come to check for the real, correct info. Q - Where do you see SteemSTEM in 5 years? A - I see the future to be much awesome, there is this growing awareness of many blockchain-based projects, and with the great team spearheading steem I know the future will be amazing with loads of juicy offers in the offing. It was an honor interviewing @greenrun and I would like to sincerely thank him for finding time to answer my questions.

Monday - Thursday (first half of the week) Let’s play - a mental game of time perception Time. What is time? What would happen if our internal clock would be ticking way slower. Way way slower. And what about faster? the way humans perceive time drives the way we see the world. @erh.germany introduces a very intriging thought experiment to start discussing about time perception and issues that could be connected if human’s life would spend in a day, or even less (or much longer). Feel free to read the post and share your view. The Lion’s Temple of Medinet Madi Lions! They play a special role in the iconography of ancient Egypt, connected to the power of the pharao and related to some of the powerful Egyptian’s gods. @laylahsophia tells us more about them and about one of her recent research works on lion pictures present in Egyptian oases. Science communication as SteemSTEM is proud to support! Thursday - Sunday (second half of the week) How free are we truly, and how much of us is instinct and biology? When do we start making a decision or controling a situation and when are we acting instincitively. @cryptosharon starts a very interesting philosophical debate in her post. Feel free to have a look and participate. Statistics Last week, the SteemSTEM curator teams have supported 133 posts. 18 of them have been posted through the app (and got a 5% stronger upvote).

Anything related with the amount of carbon in the atmosphere may be impacted with climate changes (that are connected with carbon emission by humans). Subsequently, archeology, that often relies on dating artefacts with the concentration of radioactive carbon-14 in them, cannot escape this. @samve brings the topic in his post, together with comprehensively explaining how carbon-14 dating works. The Double Helix, Photo 51 and the Challenge of Priority: Who Gets Credit in Science? A story such as those we do not like to hear. @agmoore tells us everything discovery of the double-helix structure of the DNA. From who took the first picture of it, who got the credits and the Nobel prize for it and how the truth got the be known. A lot of not so great behaviors in this story, unfortunately. Science is not always a dream… The Organic Fraud What we eat is very important and we probably all agree on this. Our friend @midhunkm discusses this topic in his post, and focuses in particular on the current trend about organic food and the fact that not everything originating from nature is actually safe to eat. This brings in the problem that some pseudoscientists may try to sell natural products curing all diseases on Earth, and more. Feel free to read the post and participate to the discussion.

Big changes have taken place, incentives for steemSTEM support have been announced, the developers team is closely working with the management for version 2 of the steemstem.io and one of (apparently) your favorite section has been realized! Interviewing the Team! This biweekly blog is shared with you in our efforts to bring the community closer together and with our goal to keep you updated about what is going behind and in front of the scenes! ### Incentives for promoting &amp; supporting STEM —- Following our efforts for building a unique science communication on the Steem blockchain, we decided to expand into bringing more research institutes, renowned science bloggers and researchers directly on Steem. For this to be achieved, SteemSTEM needs to be economically sustainable in order for us to plan and fund our new steps. Therefore we are calling all supporters to delegate or to support in any other way they can think of. As an incentive for the extra support and a token of our appreciation, we decided to share 65% of the SteemSTEM weekly curation rewards with all the benefactors. Thank You to everyone who has already been supporting us, we are grateful to see such warm acceptance and trust from the community! For more information about how you can participate, make sure to read here — Convenient delegation links: 50 SP | 100SP | 250SP | 500SP | 1000SP — ### Changes in Management — People evolve, mature, change. So do relationships and so do teams. Ever since SteemSTEM was created by @lemouth &amp; @justtryme90, there have been many people that have helped, joined forces and did their best in growing this community. In the process, some of them have decided to take other paths, with a slightly (or not) different direction. The current Management consists of @justtryme90, @lemouth, @mobbs, while anarchyhasnogods is no longer a member of the SteemSTEM management. Suesa remains in the team as the Head of the Honor Members. —– ### New Voting Bot in Town — You may have already noticed. What, no? Well, we have deployed a brand new voting bot! For you who have only just discovered that there is a voting bot and are wondering about it: For transparency reasons, our discord curation channel is open for everyone to see which articles get promoted and the weight these posts are voted with. If you still do not understand what this means, we invite you over to discord to see for yourselves! — ### First Team Interview with @ruth-girl — This has been planned for some time, but we believe now is the right time to launch it! A community is all about its members, and we decided to bring the SteemSTEM Curators a step closer to the front; to reveal their secrets and to ask for their advice to the new and existing STEM authors! Because after all, quality and knowledge is our main goal! This time, @ruth-girl, our most experienced curator has opened her home and heart to @katerinaramm and has answered some (according to a few, too easy but nevertheless interesting) questions! Read all about it and let us know in the comments section what else you would like to learn from the next interviewee! —- ### Changes coming to steemstem.io! — Since announcing the new steemSTEM app steemstem.io, we have received very important feedback from all the community. We are working closely to improve the usability and user friendliness and we will soon plan to announce the Version 2 of the project. Stay Tuned! — ### Update on the new state-of-the-art python program by @lemouth — If you are only just hearing about this, please read the official announcement. A couple of weeks ago, @lemouth announced an exciting project and has invited developers to join the team! &gt; The aim of this project is very simple: together with a team of developers soon to be formed, we will develop a Python version of FeynRules that anyone could run for free, without having to rely on an unaffordable framework. The project has just commenced and you can read its update here Some of the tasks requested include: - to design a command line interface (CLI). - to define a class and a bunch of functions (details on the above link) and also… a nice logo might (will) be needed! So if you are a developer or happen to know one, make sure to read and forward the above info! — ### What’s next? — Well, for starters, a new interview is being prepared. New updates about steemstem.io will follow and more will be announced in short time! —- ##### Have you voted for steemSTEM Witness? —- This concludes our weekly news update, we hope you enjoyed it and learnt something new! Make sure to follow steemstem on steemit, facebook, twitter, and instagram to always be up-to-date on our latest news and ideas. We are always on the lookout for new scientific articles from all types of authors, so even if you are not a proven researcher, but you like engaging in science yourself, be sure to reach out to us!

The Steemit Chat Channel: #steemSTEM Announcing steemSTEM, a Science - Technology - Engineering - Mathematics Project on SteemitThe OriginsEverything began some time ago when @coinbitgold initiated the academiaspotlight series to promote the work of new Steemians who are engineers and/or scientists in their day jobs. She quickly realized that she was only able to help one person at a time with each review post, and that many other good science posts still went unnoticed and silenced. Moreover, she became frustrated seeing some outright-plagiarized science content rewarded more than the good content! At this point she considered leaving Steemit for good. Yet just as things were looking their worst she met @wingz who suggested starting a science community on Steemit! At the same time, she met real-life scientists and active contributors like @justtryme90 and @lemouth who were also working to grow the Steemit science community day by day. Together, a community of science writers on Steemit was born. A New HopeAnd do you think they lived happily ever after? Of course not. The group still watched as some partially or totally inaccurate science content got trendy and upvoted a lot! Still they did not give up, they pushed forward and kept supporting each other. Soon, an Initiative Started… This group now consisting of scientists, engineers, mathematicians, science and technology writers, @justtryme90 @lemouth @coinbitgold @herpetologyguy @pjheinz @team.leibniz @cristi @valenttina @krishtopa @deviedev @daut44 @logic and others. Everyone shared their views on the future of science on Steemit. The InitiativesAnd we are here today to announce the steemSTEM initiative! http://oi63.tinypic.com/20ky92v.jpg Goals Foster the STEM spirit and a constructive STEM environment for STEM writers on Steemit. Raise the quality of the current STEM content via feedback to authors. Increase the quality of the discussions originating from STEM posts (as comments to the posts). Recruit established STEM bloggers to expand the content already discussed on Steemit. Organize events such as interviews, AMAs and competitions. Promote the work of current and future STEM writers on Steemit. How Can You Help The steemSTEM Initiative? Spread the news about the #steemSTEM channel on the Steemit chat! If you identify a new STEM writer, please do not hesitate to direct them to the #steemSTEM channel. If you are a real-life scientist/engineer/mathematician with expertise in a STEM field and feel that you can fill in some of the gaps currently lacking in background and knowledge, please do not hesitate to join the #steemSTEM channel and discuss with us. From time to time, we will be holding STEM AMAs, competitions and interviews revolving around STEM. Do watch out for them and show your support with comments, votes and participation! Resteem, resteem and resteem! ALL funds raised by posts of the @steemstem account will be used by the steemSTEM initiative to recruit established STEM bloggers, provide rewards and prizes for STEM events and competitions, and provide additional curation and upvotes for STEM posts on Steemit.
