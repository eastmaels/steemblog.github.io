#### The Project @team-cn has been operating for almost half a year, but we haven’t had a chance to officially introduce ourselves to the English community. So now we are going to introduce ourselves, what we do and how the Chinese community is doing lately.
<br/>
@team-cn was created by @honoru, @ericet and @softmetal in April, 2018. As you can guess from the name, @team-cn focuses on the Chinese community on Steemit. Hence, most of the articles @team-cn has published are in Chinese. The aim of this article is to let more people from the English-speaking community get an idea of what @team-cn does.

Since the creation of @team-cn, one of the major focuses of @team-cn is to introduce newbies to the Steemit community by interviewing them with a few questions. Some of the questions include: 

Where do you live? 
What is your occupation?
How do you want us to call you?
Why do you join Steemit?
What topics do you plan to write on Steemit?
etc.

These questions serve as an introduction of the newbies to let the community know the newbies better. In addition, all the Steem/SBD made from the upvotes of the article will be given to the newbies. In most cases, this is the first ‘big income’ for newbies, typically around 2 to 3 Steem/SBD, which makes them really excited from the get-go and be confident to continue writing more articles on Steemit.

Currently, we have introduced 66 newbies to CN community and most of them are still active on steemit. 

In addition, we created a WeChat group named Steemit CN Newbie’s Village. All the @team-cn members have ever been interviewed would then be invited to join the group. In this group, we provide continuing guidances to the newbies. It is a very active group with a lot of discussion on how to make the CN community better and answer any question that members may have on Steemit.

To encourage members to reach higher reputation, we organized a graduation ceremony. For all the @team-cn members who reach certain reputation, @team-cn will write a post to congratulate on their graduations. All the Steem/SBD made from the upvotes of the post will be given to the newbies.

School grading system is set as follows:

Middle School Student: Reputation reaches 50
High School Student: Reputation reaches 60
College Student: Reputation reaches 65
Graduate Student: Reputation reaches 70

Currently, more than 20 members have reached reputation 50 or higher.

# <center>Posts Recommendation by Flying Pigeon(CN Curation Project)</center>

In collaboration with @htliao, we created a CN curation project @cn-curation. We invited three other members, @julian2013, @kidsreturn and @itchyfeetdonica, to form an editing group with us. Each day, a member of the editing group selects two undervalued articles (typically less than $0.4 worth of upvote) from the CN community and writes a summary for each article. @htliao then recommends these two articles from his account. Since @htliao has a high reputation (71) and high SP, the content posted from his account attracts more readers. In this way, the two undervalued articles are exposed to more readers. In addition, @htliao will also upvote these two articles.

Each time an article is selected, @team-cn will sponsor the Steem Basic Income (SBI) membership for the author. Since SBI provides life-time upvotes, it encourages the author to keep posting high quality articles.

At this time, @team-cn's account has ~30 Steem. We decided to use the Steem to fund activities in the CN community. We encourage anyone who wants to organize an activity and/or contest in the CN community to contact us. We can then discuss how we can help fund the activity.

Currently, we are sponsoring two CN activities. We are giving out 6 SBI to @tydebbie for her story contest and 1 SBI daily to @aellly for his curation project.
