I joined Steemit in May and I just had more than 150 followers. It feels great when another milestone was achieved!

During the journey here, I met a lot of great people and gained so much help here. Thank them. I would also like to thank all of my followers, I hope you enjoy reading my posts, let make Steemit better together.

And now I am going to give some useful tips for beginners.
# join a community, if there is not one, Build one

It's hard to work alone, join others and form a community. Helping each other is the beauty

# seek help from senior Steemians
There's time we have little Steem power, try to find help in the chatroom and from the others' posts

For example,
@neoxian has a recent post that lends Steem Power to beginners

# utilitizes your creativity and post things interest you
Choose some topics and post something interests you, for example, it's cryptocurrency, food, silver coins and travel to me.
# enjoy the fun of Steemit and money will follow
Steemit is fun, just enjoy reading and writing in it and money will follow. It's that simple!
