I believe that each one of us does care about the number of views of our posts, especially when you have put so much effort in them. You will definitely want more readers to ACTUALLY read your contents other than just leaving meaningless words like “nice post”, “upvoted” and “follow me and I will follow you” on your posts. So, YES, I do care about the number of views a lot. Therefore, I started to pay attention to the little eye icon at the right bottom corner, checking which ones of my posts have more views, which can let me to look into which topic my readers may enjoy most.


Here below is the number of views of my post:

* [隨筆:淺談投資，為什麽我把手上的比特幣全放了](https://steemit.com/cn/@htliao/x69xa)

222 views, already quite good for a post that is only written in Chinese. Maybe it's because people are interested in the recent Bitcoin trend.


* [My University Life #1](https://steemit.com/life/@htliao/my-university-life-1-1)

378 views, cool! Still there are some people interested in my personal life and want to know more about me.


* [Travel with me to Nagoya, Japan(2) Kamikochi](https://steemit.com/travel/@someone/travel-with-me-to-nagoya-japan-2kamikochi-2-by-htliao)

388 views, so happy that many people read my travel post to Japan

* [Anime Character Drawing Challenge | 50 SBD Prize Pool](https://steemit.com/cn/@htliao/anime-character-drawing-challenge-or-50-sbd-prize-pool-or-50-sbd)

This post has 545 views, thanks for those who participated in this challenge once again

* [Hello Steemit! This is Desmond!](https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@htliao/hi-steemit-this-is-desmond-desmond)

776 views, so happy that many people want to know more about me.

* [Why I think 99% of Steemians get the WRONG ideas about curation rewards](https://steemit.com/steemit/@htliao/why-i-think-99-of-steemians-get-the-wrong-ideas-about-curation-rewards)

889 views, WOW, seems that many people want to know more about the common misconception regarding curation rewards

# [Robot Cash! Is it really paying or it is a scam?](https://steemit.com/chainbb-general/@htliao/robot-cash-is-it-really-paying-or-it-is-a-scam-2017612t213154124z)

To my surprise, this is my post with the largest number of views, 
# with over 5500 views!! 

![robot cash.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUaAgXWhdbdwHFgHJJ8Yjx948koCjzMhnjrRYzPBSfMVc/robot%20cash.png)
I searched “Robot Cash” on Google and it turned out to be the top fourth result, but the effort I spent in this post is significantly less than my average post now. I am pretty sure that most of the people read this post don’t know about Steemit before, so it may let more people outside become interested in this platform. 

# This post may have let 5000 people get to know Steemit

I think you may still not be able to get the ideas of how 5500 views are like. Let me make it simple for you, even one of the most famous and popular authors on this platform, @sweetsssj, got less than 3000 views for her post two days ago. 

# AND I WAS ONLY A MINNOW AT THAT TIME, no difference from you who are reading this post.

After knowing this, I start wondering why so many people are interested in faucets and free bitcoin apps or bots like this but don’t pay attention to Steemit. You can only earn a few bucks or even cents on these stupid faucet sites while there are plenty of opportunities here on this platform, as long as you possess some strength, knowledge or skills. If we can draw the attention of these people, this may lead to a drastic increase in the number of Steemit users.

# What websites/ apps I am still using to get free Bitcoins?

By the way, when I wrote this post I don’t know whether the bot was a scam but I now know the answer. It was renamed to Cash Robots and It’s actually paying and I received my first payment after a couple of months. It was not a large sum of money but I am happy to receive it and unlike other faucet sites, this bot doesn't require you to enter the captcha repeatedly, so I am still using it.

Here is the payment proof:

Another faucet site that I would recommend is FreeBitco, which is the best paying faucet site that has been operating for several years. I feel that I can trust the website and you could even claim your Bitcoin Cash if you had Bitcoin balance on the website during the Bitcoin hard fork in August. It has features like lucky draws, multiplying, rewards points and lottery. Most importantly, it has an annual interest rate of 4.08% compounded daily if you holds Bitcoin there, so I also put some of my Bitcoin there.

You may think that these free Bitcoin stuffs are some useless spam and just a waste of time, but that may be how a lot of people get started with cryptocurrency and the number of views of my post has already proven that. To sum up, I think that we can write about some topics that people will google for it, giving it a catchy title with a good use of keywords. Then we may have more and more people knowing about this incredible platform when your article or blog appears on top of the search lists, combined with the help of SEO(I am not an expert in it), and it may be a good way to promote Steemit too.

大家好，今天我們談的是點擊率。相信我們都注意到帖子右下角的小眼睛圖案吧，旁邊就有個數字顯示了有多少人看過你的帖子了。我想大家都很介意有多少人真的有看我們的帖子吧，特別是看到辛苦寫好的帖子卻無人問津，這感覺應該會很難受吧。點擊率是我很注重的東西，畢竟能決定你文章價值的，就是你的讀者，沒有人看你的帖子的話，責任是在你的，你應該要思考一下有什麽地方可以作出改善，寫什麼樣的內容會比較好，比較多人會感興趣，所以你的讀者數量也會影響到我的點贊權重。像我也一直想辦法寫一些比較多人會關心的題目，想盡辦法利用標題和圖片來吸引讀者的注意，寫一些令人容易感興趣的內容，~~像你不也是被我的標題騙進來嗎?~~

回到正題，點擊率，你可以在上面看到我一些帖子的點擊率，有少許英語但應該很淺白易懂的啦，你能看懂的。對點擊率來說，寫英文或雙語帖子當然是有一定優勢的，始終英文用戶還是主流的。我覺得我還算做得不錯啦，當然和一些熱門的作者比還有一大段距離......


最令我驚訝的是，我最多點擊率的帖子竟然不是那些我傾盡心血寫的帖子，而是一篇關於Robot Cash－一個手機應用telegram上的機械人的帖子，~~那時還只是用來在chainBB上發帖騙贊~~，可以用來獲取免費的比特幣，當然速度很慢就是了。我這帖子用谷歌來搜索Robot Cash這個關鍵字還排在第四位呢!我可能還間接讓五千多人接觸到Steemit呢嘿嘿。

這令我不禁想到，如果能把這些人都拉進Steemit，用戶人數不是會呈爆炸性的增長嗎？連這些拿免費比特幣的機器人和水龍頭網站都能得到這麽多點擊率，辛辛苦苦按驗證碼也只能賺得一些零錢，如果他們知道了Steemit這個平台那還得了？

我自己是不懂那些SEO的東西，但說不定還真有那麼點用，能增加你博客的流量，寫一些人們會搜尋的內容，把標題弄得顯眼一點。像我不久前寫了個關於室內攀石的帖子，原來我的朋友剛去了，當她在谷歌搜尋「Verm City攀石」 找資訊時也發現了我的帖子，在第一頁的最下方，還特地傳簡訊告訴我呢，令我滿驚訝的。

最後，如果你對這些免費拿比特幣的網站有興趣的話，FreeBitco是另一個我有在使用的網站，這兩個都比較不花時間，你把比特幣放上面還能得到4.08%的年息呢，而且是每日結算的，比起我不太信任的P網這是我賺取微薄利息的方法。你夠好運的話還能抽到價值200美元的比特幣呢。

嗯，話說有技術大神在看這帖嗎？能寫個程式或網頁抓出所有帖子的views嗎?經常要按進去才能得知這數據挺麻煩的。 xD
