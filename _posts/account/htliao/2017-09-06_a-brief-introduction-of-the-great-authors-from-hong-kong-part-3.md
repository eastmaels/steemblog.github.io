@wilkinshui 's cute son

@wilkinshui is one of the older member within the Hong Kong community and he also invested some of his money in Steem. He has relocated to Taiwan since two years ago due to family reason and therefore he would share about the living life in Taiwan as well as his son’s growing moment. He is also attracted to the cryptocurrency world as he believe it would give the best risk and return trade off against any investible assets in the world and he is eager to share his learning note with all of you. You can visit some of his posts here:

致中文區的朋友：
又來到這個介紹香港優秀作者的系列了，這次介紹的作者都有各自的長處呢，像 @mellissaying本身不僅是YouTuber，還是一個化妝師呢，愛美麗的女士們記得多留意她的化妝教學短片了。除此之外，她還是一個出過唱片和有自己MV的歌手呢。 @wilkinshui除了有一個可愛的兒子外，還是一個熱衷於投資的好手呢，他現在對加密貨幣很有興趣，如果你也對加密貨幣有興趣的話，你可以留意一下他的學習筆記。  @shirlam除了會寫精彩的食物和旅遊的帖子外，因為她就讀法律系，還會寫一些關於法律的文章呢，現在在中文區應該是只此一家哦。如果你喜歡科學的話，別忘了follow @mcw看他的化學帖子了，寫得都十分仔細和精彩呢，相信你看完後會增長不少科學的知識的。

最後，希望中文區的大家繼續支持來自香港的優秀作者，我們會繼續為大家帶來不同範疇的精彩內容，一起努力壯大中文區，記得follow他們了。

至於上次的帖子奬勵已經分發給各位參與的作者了，和這次一樣，此帖子的SBD收入也會平分給所有在此帖介紹的作者，大家繼續努力寫好文章吧。
