Hi @jesta, I have regretted why I didn't start using chainbb earlier as it's such a great forum to view posts and interact with other Steemians. However, I always find it troublesome signing up for Steemchat or Discord and use a different webpage just to chat with others or asking for upvote. It would be nice if an instant messager, like what is in Facebook, is implemented and we can use that to chat with each other. I know it may be a lot of work to do, so I just want to ask if it is feasible?

Another suggestion is that we may have some friends on Steemit that we like or enjoy reading their articles, and sometimes that's difficult to spot them out when they have new posts. So I suggest that a friends list can be added and we can directly see their posts under a specific tag, maybe called friends or favourite?

Thanks for reading this, keep up with you great work and contribution to Steemit.
