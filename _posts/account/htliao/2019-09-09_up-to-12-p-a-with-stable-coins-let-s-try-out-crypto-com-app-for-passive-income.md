Crypto.com has recently announced the Crypto.com Earn 3.0. Users can use their wallet balance to get a considerable passive income simply by using the Earn function. Every 7 days, the coins will be credited to your wallet balance and the highest interest rate is **12% for stable coins**!(You have to lock up 500 MCO) For now, it only supports TUSD, PAX and USDC. It seems that the support for USDT is under development.

# Even without locking of MCO tokens, it has 10% p.a.



but not every country and region supports the Earn function due to regulatory problems.


The interest rate of Crypto.com's own blockchain CRO tokens even reached up to 18%, SO FREAKING CRAZY!

# One more question, how to ensure the funds are SAFU?

Crypto.com uses 100% cold storage and the users' funds are insured by third party, with a US $100M insurance. Crypto.com has a strategic partnership with Ledger(company manufacturing Ledger Nano S/X) to secure the funds.

You can visit their website if you are not confident enough:

DO your own research!

There are three types: Flexible, one-month and three-month, and the interest rates are different. (Of course)


And what does Crypto.com do? The answer is VISA card payment. You can directly pay in your daily life using their cards, and it even has **cash rebates in terms of MCO**! I saw my friend used the card to pay for his lunch using this card. It works!

# It is undoubtedly the best way to bring CRYPTO to the real LIFE!

The Royal Indigo is the middle tier, you need to lock up 500 MCO for 6 months to get the card. Using the card to pay can have 3% cashback in terms of MCO, and have free access to airport lounges, Netflix and Spotify. No extra fees. It seems WORTH it. With currently BTC dominance over 70%, most altcoin have a really cheap price.

The black one is awesome, but seems difficult to get, you have to lock 50,000 MCO to get it. (So I am not gonna talk about it)


Crypto.com has 130 + employees worldwide, and it is an established company in the cryptocurrency space. I am sure many of you have heard of the name of the company, so you can trust them to put your funds there. 


Its such a pity that it does not support STEEM(but support its sibling EOS) at the moment, otherwise we can directly use STEEM to pay using the card! 


# If you are interested, you can download it via my referral link:https://platinum.crypto.com/r/cb2bjdzqyk 

# and we can both get $50 worth of MCO, in USD! 

but you need to stake 50 MCO to unlock them, since this is a promotional campaign.
