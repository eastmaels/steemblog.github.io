Hi my Steemit friends,

The number of Hong Kong Steemians has been growing at a steady pace and we can see new people moving to Steemit almost every day.

Last time I have introduced some of the great authors in Hong Kong, and you can view [the post here](https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@htliao/a-brief-introduction-of-the-great-authors-from-hong-kong-part-1). Today I am going to introduce more great HK authors and their post series to you. We will try our best to keep producing **diversified, original and high quality** content. Please follow them and check out their posts if you think their contents are interesting.

I think I would just stop here and next time I will introduce more great authors from Hong Kong to you, please stay tuned and support the younger Steemians. We will definitely need your support and encouragement. The SBD rewards from the last post have already been distributed to the authors' wallets.

![Screen Shot 2017-08-15 at 11.13.37 pm.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRWZM7U1qYdfTFTVuj9qqUyAowJW3Qee2HwWvxV6SULTD/Screen%20Shot%202017-08-15%20at%2011.13.37%20pm.png)

# Note: ALL SBD rewards of this post will also be evenly distributed to the authors introduced in this post and thus support the growth of the Steemit community in Hong Kong.

致中文區的朋友：

上次和大家介紹了幾個香港優秀作者，相信這裡應該很少人不認識他們了，有新來中文區的朋友也可以follow一下他們，看看他們十分用心寫的帖子。這次為大家多介紹幾位來自香港的作者，他們的帖子都寫得很詳細，也有著不同的題材，例如@biuiam就主要是寫生物學的雙語科普文章，他們都是十分優秀的作者呢。

這帖子的主要目的是向外國朋友介紹一下香港區的優秀雙語作者，為他們多增加一些追隨者人數，~~特別是美女，應該很容易就能引來一大堆外國來的狂蜂浪蝶了~~。

希望大家繼續支持香港區的優秀作者，一起努力狀大中文區。

至於上次的帖子奬勵已經分發給各位參與的作者了，這次也是一樣，此帖子的SBD收入將會平分給所有在此帖介紹的作者。
