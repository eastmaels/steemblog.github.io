You can find all wallets' review here, for all coins.

For wallets, there are different types of them, cold wallet, hot wallet. It's safer to put your funds in cold wallet as they are not connected to the internet. On the other hand, those connected to the internet is called hot wallets, don't put all your funds there.

There are also different kinds of wallets like paper wallet, desktop wallets and hardware wallet. Just pick one you like after you understand their pros and cons.

Useful Apps to check price: Blockfolio, CoinCap, ZeroBlock
