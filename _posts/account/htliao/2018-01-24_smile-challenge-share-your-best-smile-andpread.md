Hello my Steemit friends,


![smile_Challenge.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmWuPGwfNgVG5PrRAtoPzHJDcPLPSu4gBGHZKS4hwvUHNy/smile_Challenge.png)

Recently, I was nominated by @krischy and @travelgirl to join the #smilechallenge launched by @herlife. 

This photo was shot when I was helping with the Registration Day in university. I missed my university life and that was one of my happiest moments in my life. 


Smiling is infectious. After all, what’s more important than living a happy life, sharing your joy with your family and friends? Therefore, don’t forget to put a smile on your face and spread positive energy to the others. 



Rules for “Smile Challenge”:
* Pick a photo that you show your best smile
* Nominate your friends to pass your smile, you can nominate as many people as you want
* Make a post, put the smile of the one nominated you in the left and put your smile in the right. 
* Use the tag #smilechallenge for your post

At last, I would like to nominate @susanlo , @shirlam, @michelleluilui, @sweetdisaster to join the challenge.
