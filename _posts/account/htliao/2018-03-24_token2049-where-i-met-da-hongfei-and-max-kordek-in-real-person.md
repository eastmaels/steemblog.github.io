TOKEN2049 is the largest cryptocurrency event in Asia and I was excited that I was able to join this event.

Many well-known blockchain projects attended the event, such as NEO, LISK, Wanchain and Quoine. I even had a chance to have a short conversation and take a photo with Da Hongfei, Neoâ€™s Founder and CEO at Onchain.

Also, I also met Max Kordek, President of the Lisk Foundation. I was super excited and he was very nice. I could tell that the Lisk team was definitely committed to the project from our conversation. They had a thorough development plan and many team members came to Hong Kong to join this event too.

I could spot out STEEM on the official brouchure too!

Many influential speakers also shared their vision and projects, and it was nice listening to their sharing. I was impressed by their vision and hard work. I strongly believe that 2018 will definitely be an awesome year for blockchain technology to have its real applications.
