It was a cloud day and my friends invited me to join hiking with them. This time we are hiking in Kowloon Peak. The weather was comfortable and we started hiking. Soon, we found out that the hiking route was not easy and we needed to use both our hands to find some grass or rocks to hold on, it was pretty dangerous actually.

Giving a helping hand and encouraging each other was the key

We did not know whether we were hiking along the right hiking route and we thought that we might have gone lost. So, when we reached the Suicide Cliff, we were already exhausted, and we were so happy to finally reach the peak.

The View on the Suicide Cliff was spectacular. It was pretty scaring actually, but many people was taking photos here.
