Celsius Network is a cryptocurrency lending app that enables users to earn interest from company loans. They have several security measures:
* Using BitGo as their custodian company
* 100M worth of insurance for users' fund
* coins are stored in old storage 

You can earn as high as 8%  for your coins, including Bitcoin and various stable coins.

Advantage: 
* No fees for withdrawal
* flexible term, you can withdraw your funds whenever you like
* interests are distributed in a weekly basis

Disadvantages:
* Needs KYC and 1 CEL balance to use the app
* Simple interest but not compound interest for now

I have used this app for three months are it's working pretty well, the interest rate has a weekly update according to the market conditions. Though Celsius Network is a legit business entity and has clear security measures to ensure the safety of the users' funds , please note that all cryptocurrency companies are still considered as startups and don't put all of your funds in it.
