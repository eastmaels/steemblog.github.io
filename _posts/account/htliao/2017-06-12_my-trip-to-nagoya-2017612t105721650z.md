Japan is really a good place to visit with beautiful scenery and delicious food, and I like sushi and Japanese beef particularly. So I am a frequent visitor of Japan. Last month, I went to Nagoya with my family and found there fascinating.

This is the famous village in Nagoya that everyone would visit.

The village is famous for the traditional Japanese house in it.

The Sakura blossom there is so beautiful, you have to see them if you are going at the right time of the year.
