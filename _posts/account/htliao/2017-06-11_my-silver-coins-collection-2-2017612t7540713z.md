Hello Steemians, here comes the part 2 of my silver coins collection :)


# Australia 2015 Merry Christmas Tree Star Shaped Holiday Ornament $1 Silver Proof

 ![image](https://i.imgur.com/gMP92Ep.jpg)

Year: 2015
Mint: Perth Mint
Mintage: 3000

Perth Mint is one of my favourite mints because   
They always produce some beautiful collectible coins with different themes, and they usually look elegant with a great design

# September Birthstone (Sapphire) - Fine Silver Coin

Year: 2012
Mint: Royal Canadian Mint

It's always nice to have your birthstone Coin, to bring you some luck and power hopefully, but September is not my birthday month, haha.


# 10 Y Panda Silver 24 K Gold Black Empire China 2017

Thanks for reading this, I am a Chinese so I like coins with a Chinese topic like Chinese zodiac and panda.
