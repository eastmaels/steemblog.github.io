Three Tastes Tofu in Fortune Bag at Hoi King Heen, InterContinental Grand Stanford Hotel. Not a big fan of tofu but this award- winning dish will definitely redeem your experience! Spiced up with a delicious mixture of vegetables, ginger, water chestnuts and mushrooms, the tofu bean curd was teamed with strong savoury flavours and soft, silky texture.
