Dear my Steemit friends, 

![22829288_1981338695439431_6417433224726930118_o.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmWk5EyjBCoycUqbSxcYCTTvRbXPsAnVb5gkkTUfSQV67v/22829288_1981338695439431_6417433224726930118_o.jpg)

I am pleased to announce that I held a cryptocurrency seminar successfully in November. (At that time Bitcoin was below $7000!) The seminar was conducted in one of the finest hotels in Hong Kong, Kerry Hotel. It was my honour to work closely with Kafnu, a co-working space for entrepreneurs and creatives, to make this event a success. There was around fifty persons attending the seminar and that was a valuable experience to me sharing my own thoughts of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.

Though Bitcoin started to be mentioned by the mainstream media by that time, many people still don't know much about the principles behind, its implications and where to buy Bitcoin at a reasonable price. Some innocent people even fall into the trap of cloud mining. The event successfully brought the people who are interested in cryptocurrency together and let them share their experience with each other. There was also a talk given by me about how to buy Bitcoin and some background of other cryptocurrency. Light refreshments and craft beer were also served to cater our guests.

# During the seminar, i also shared with them my blogging experience on Steemit and the revolutionary ideas behind STEEM and the other STEEM-based platforms(at that time STEEM was trading only around $1), and I am sure that many of them would be interested and look into it after they got back home.

If you have missed the event, there is another upcoming talk given by me titled "The Top 10 Cryptocurrencies to Watch Out in 2018!" in late January, and of course, with Smart Media Tokens being released soon in 2018, STEEM would be one of them to be mentioned!!
