Recently, I used a pen to draw a character in a mobile game that I used to play. That's really hard to sketch using a pen since you cannot risk to fail, even once.



This is Horus from the famous Japanese mobile game Puzzle and Dragons. Horus was an Egyptian Sun God and was often depicted as an eagle.

And this is what Horus looks like in the game.

This is Horus's evolved form

And this is the final evolved form

Puzzle and Dragons is a mobile game with more than 50 million downloads worldwide, and it always has events with other anime, such as Attack On Titan.
