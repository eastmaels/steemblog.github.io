Hello my Steem friends,
 
 Recently I have joined the Partiko Mentors Round 2 and I would like to share my Partiko journey with you.

 We all know that Partiko is one of the best Dapp build on the Steem Blockchain. It’s an honour to help Partiko grow so I sent my application and was selected by @rosatravels.

 I have tried to comment under the #introduceyourself posts but the response was not very good. Therefore, I switched my focus to onboard some Chinese bloggers who have already written their own blogs on other sites to try out Partiko.



 Fortunately, some of them were willing to try out Partiko and some even become an active users who comment and post a lot. It’s nice to help minnows grow bit by bit. I invited 7 users so far. 

 One of the difficulties encountered was explaining the ecosystem of the Steem Blockchain to them, and they usually don’t get used to the handling of private keys. I spent a lot of time trying to explain everything on Steem to them. But overall, it’s a nice experience.
