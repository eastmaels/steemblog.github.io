This chirashi bowl was the best one I have ever tried. The fishes are very fresh and outstanding, and the price was reasonable. It was incredible and the restaurant is located inside the fish market of Kanazawa, Nagoya. If you are a lover of Japanese food and sashimi, this is a must-try one for you.
