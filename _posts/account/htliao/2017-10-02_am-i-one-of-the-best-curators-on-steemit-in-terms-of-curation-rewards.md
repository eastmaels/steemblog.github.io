After reading @tumutanzi 's article about curation rewards, I realised that I may be one of the successful curators in terms of curation rewards obtained.

Here below is a table showing the curation rewards of the curators under the #cn tag(except @osm0sis)

Steemit id | SP gained from curation rewards of the last seven days | Effective SP | annual rate of return(%)
-|-|-|-
@snowflake |<center> 258.14</center> | 179,421.78 | <center>7.50</center>
@abit |<center>1656.33</center>|1,094,673.38|<center>7.89</center>
@sweetsssj|<center>1,156.38</center>|852,373.30|<center>7.07</center>
@justyy|<center>6.20</center>|4,713.00|<center>6.86</center>
@htliao|<center>1028.81</center>|510,925.00|<center><b> 10.50</b></center>
@osm0sis|<center>1.28</center>|637.88|<center>10.43</center>
@tumutanzi|<center>614.95</center>|515,821.00|<center>6.22</center>

And now I am going to share my curation strategies, which is statistically proven to be one of the most successful ones on this platform!

Firstly, for some famous authors, I tend to vote between 15 and 27 minutes after the post is created.

And for the newbies and less famous Steemians who make a good post I tend to vote after 30 minutes. In a more ideal case, not many people have voted before and some dolphins or even whales vote after me then the curation rewards can be maximised.

Most importantly, the crux lies on diversifying your votes. Split your votes into lower voting percentage and let more Steemians benefit, especially for those posts which are under-valued.

So this is why the design of Steemit's reward system is so smart, it encourages the content curators who are holding a large sum of Steem power to continually discover undervalued contents and diversify their votes by giving them more rewards, benefiting both the active curators and the good authors.

In fact, if you have less SP, it is much easier to get a higher curation efficiency. So if you apply these strategies and give more votes to others you will probably get a higher % of return via curation than I do. If you think you don't have enough SP, just buy it, and support your fellow Steemit friends and good authors. Steem is a very good investment and has a high percentage of return, especially after the introduction of SMTs, I believe Steem will have a bright future.


Besides, you can also give some votes to the persons who leave constructive comments on your posts after thirty minutes. This is a bit tricky because you can get all the curation rewards from the comment, and you can also encourage more people to read your posts and interact with your contents.

So thatâ€™s basically how I curate to maximise my curation rewards based on the mechanism of curation rewards, but I am not going to explain it in detail. If you want to know more about it, you can visit [this post](https://steemit.com/steemit/@calamus056/curation-rewards-explained-in-great-detail) made by @calamus056 instead.

Though these skills are indeed useful, it takes a lot of time to implement, to manually curate the posts. The only reason that I am able to achieve that is because I have a lot of spare time to spend on this platform, and I don't think it would be worth to imitate what I do if you don't have a large sum of Steem Power. Of course, you can buy a large sum of Steem and power up, just simply follow my curation trail and you may get a good profit. xD In fact, I have already noticed some smart guys following my curation trail.

I also wrote [a post explaining one of the common misconceptions about curation rewards]( https://steemit.com/steemit/@htliao/why-i-think-99-of-steemians-get-the-wrong-ideas-about-curation-rewards#@fabiyamada/re-htliao-re-fabiyamada-re-htliao-why-i-think-99-of-steemians-get-the-wrong-ideas-about-curation-rewards-20171002t035707435z) and why most people got it wrong three months ago. If you have not read it, you may be interested in this topic.

Thanks for reading and I hope you will have a better understanding of curation rewards, and how did I rock it!
