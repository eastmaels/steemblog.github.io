Hello my Steemit friends,

![C1351F62-1989-4297-AB2F-055A39986FF2.jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmNYh3EScwA8VujDATYCZypj28jYdwRpzFvwe4DmPSoX8s/C1351F62-1989-4297-AB2F-055A39986FF2.jpeg)

 I am pleased to announce that I held my second cryptocurrency seminar (in the same place just like [last time](https://steemit.com/promo-steem/@htliao/my-first-cryptocurrency-seminar-in-one-of-the-finest-hotels-in-hong-kong-steem-was-also-introduced)) and it made a huge success. More than eighty people joined the seminar, listening to my sharing while enjoy the craft beer in their hands.


The theme of my cryptocurrency seminar is “The Top 10 Cryptocurrencies to Watch Out in 2018”. Though we just had another “crash” in the cryptocurrency market, I think the overall future of the whole cryptocurrency market is still very promising. After all, we should not forget how much the market capitalization of the whole cryptocurrency market has risen for the past few years. Price always goes up and down at a lightning pace in cryptocurrency market, but this trend is unstoppable!

During my sharing, I shared some of my favourite cryptocurrency in 2018. Some examples are VeChain, PowerLedger, ZCash, NEO and ICON. I briefly explained what these awesome blockchain projects are doing by looking into their technology, team and roadmap, and I am sure that our guests learnt a lot of new things such as different applications of distributed ledger technology.



Of course, I wouldn’t forget to share our STEEM in my sharing, undoubtedly, STEEM is full of potential. It has a working product which has been here for 2 years (not many blockchain projects have) , a strong and supportive community and an ambitious plan. STEEM also scored B+, which is the highest grade in Weiss Cryptocurrency Rating. In fact, I am so confident in STEEM’s future that I haven’t powered down even once since I joined Steemit on Day 1. 

I believe that Steemit is a perfect place for people to enter the cryptocurrency world. It has an user-friendly interface and does not require any money to get started here, even students can start blogging on Steemit.

During my sharing, I briefly explained how STEEM and its token system work, introducing some popular STEEM-based platforms, as well as the Smart Media Tokens which give STEEM the potential to become one of the Top 10 cryptocurrency again. I hope my seminar can bring more people who do not know much about STEEM before to join our great community.

Thanks for reading. Cryptocurrency and the blockchain technology is probably one of the greatest innovations throughout he history of mankind, and definitely a golden opportunity that you should not miss out in your lifetime. Let’s learn more and more about cryptocurrency on Steemit and hope that you will be able to make a fortune in the cryptocurrency market too.
