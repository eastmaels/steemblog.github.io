Hello my Steemit friends,

![56DB231E-9DFB-435E-83F0-E6F5F203DD86.jpeg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmchFKTVF5rYfSfh7LNmbss5XeSGcoCE1ogi4uSagjJbdv)


 I am happy to announce that my new project - @cryptoast has started. CrypToast comes from the word “Toast”, implying we want to share our success with our community members and make a toast. It is a project aiming to provide an opportunity for Steemit users to join exclusive bounty programs and airdrop events with handsome rewards(including STEEM tokens). Our team will contact different ICO or established blockchain projects and see if they are interested to sponsor different kinds of contests on Steemit. 

Since now most ICO projects hold their bounty program on Bitcointalk, Telegram or Reddit, if these projects use STEEM as a platform to promote their projects, it will create a higher demand of the STEEM tokens and let more new users who are interested in cryptocurrency want to join the STEEM community, thus boosting the whole STEEM economy, creating a win-win situation for the projects and STEEM. 

You can follow @cryptoast if you want to know more about this project and currently we are holding a bounty program for a project called Tachain. Each of the 30 winners can take away 5 STEEM and 100 USD worth of Tachain tokens. You may check @cryptoast for more details.

We will have more and more contests and bounty programs coming, and the next one will be CyberMiles, a project listed on Binance already.
