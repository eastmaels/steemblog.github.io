Bibox is a relatively new exchange site, and it is an AI Enhanced Encrypted Digital Asset Exchange, formed by previous Okcoin and Huobi core team, early Bitcoin adopters and VCs. It seems that they may be able to provide qualitative computation, peer-to-peer trading and analysis on trading afterwards. Its interface looks like Binance and has a similar token system called BIX. It may eventually become a decentralised exchange. 

It’s always a wise choice to sign up for different exchange accounts to look for opportunity such as arbitrage and promotion events. You may feel free to use my referral link to sign up:

Many new potential ICOs get listed on Bibox first before it goes to the major exchanges, and that’s the perfect place for you to accumulate some new coins with great potential which can easily go 2x, 5x or even 10x in the long run. Some examples are ArcBlock, Fusion and Trinity. 

If you have invested or want to invest in ICOs, you have to open an account here because many ICOs will be listed here first. You can make use of the volatility to sell your tokens on the first day of listing and buy it back cheaper, or simply take profit. For example, I have bought some LiveEdu tokens during ICO and it will be listed on Bibox soon too!

Also, it’s also not a bad idea to buy some BIX tokens, hoping it can grow to a large and popular exchange site. After all, exchange tokens like Binance coins and Kucoin Shares performed extraordinarily well in the past.
