Crypto.com continuously roll out new features, with the cards being rolled out soon in Europe(given green light by the authority). It recently released EUR Withdrawal via SEPA network. It's now so convenient to deposit and withdraw using the app in Europe and may be a good news to bring cryptocurrency to the mass adoption.

The other features are very appealing as well, the smooth trading function, and particular i like the earn function which can receive passive income by holding your cryptocurrency there:

(but you need to stake 50 MCO to unlock them, since this is a promotional campaign)
