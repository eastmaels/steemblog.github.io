With the emergence of the different SCOT platforms, STEEM is now a place with unimaginable possibilities. It's lucky for me to take part in the early stages of different SCOT projects. Marlians is one of them and I bought Marlian tokens once it came out and I came across @surpassinggoogle's post which is named "Simplified Process For Becoming A 'Certified Ulogger'; Now 4 Very-Simple Steps Only!!!" : https://www.marlians.com/marlians/@surpassinggoogle/simplified-process-for-becoming-a-certified-ulogger-now-4-very-simple-steps-only-chinese-and-korean-translation-available

It seems like becoming a certified ulogger can enjoy more exclusive benefits, and it costs only 5 STEEM per month, so why not?

Here below are the steps:

Steps 1: Send '5 STEEM' to '@marlians' with this memo; '1 month certification'.

This is probably the easiest step and 5 STEEM is nothing at all comparing to the benefits enjoyed by a certified ulogger!

Step 2: Do a 'ulog' via 'marlians.com' discussing the process of 'how you became a certified ulogger'. Make sure to use '#ulog'.

This is not hard at all too, and obviously, it refers to this post. LOL Just remember to add a #ulog tag.

Step 3:  Subscribe to '[UloggersTV YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzI3Rjamg7zSe_o0BwSeIQQ)'.

Easy, just click 'Subscribe'.

Step 4: Fill up this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeunowd3HApzVfKIyWCdEVzX9KKjjNGi5PCIuKcQBduLT7nSA/viewform).

Not hard, just fill in the required information. DONE!

Also, don't forget to vote @steemgigs as witness through the link below:

You can check the list of 'certified uloggers' on 'https://ulogs.org/discover'

After you become a 'certified ulogger', there will be a special tag besides your username. Looks pretty cool huh!

Marlians is still at its early stage, it has just started for a week! You can easily gain friendship and a lot of tokens here if you have passion!

And the founder @surpassinggoole seems to have a promising plan for the project. Unlike other SCOT platforms it welcomes all kinds of content, all you have to do is add a tag, so why don't seize the opportunity and join now before it's too late.

Most importantly, the inflation rate of Marlians token is much more reasonable than other projects, meaning it may be easier for the tokens to retain its value. After 7 days of launching with the first batch of author and curator rewards coming out, Marlians tokens still do not drop much in value.

I believe in the future of the project so I stake more Marlians tokens, with more than 950 Marlians tokens now.
