It’s an honour to organise the [Mascot Design Contest for Partiko](https://steemit.com/partiko-contest/@htliao/partiko-mascot-design-contest--30-sbd-prize-pool-see2iedd) as it could really bring The STEEM blockchain to the mass and become one of the killer apps on STEEM. There are some people I would like to give credits to. Without their generous help and sponsorship, this contest would not be able to exist.

To make it more appealing to join the contests, I have asked some of my Steemit friends to support the entry posts. They are all very generous and they have promised to spend some time to take a look at the #partiko-contest tag during the contest period. Hope this contest can help more artists on Steemit to show their talent and creativity!

Finally, I have to thank one of the founders of @team-cn - @ericet to help me with the post promotion. Without his help, there is no way that the contest post could have made it to the trending page. 

If you want to support this contest, you can simply leave a comment below(e.g. “I want to be a supporter of Partiko Mascot Contest”)and sign up for the supporters of this contest and I will put your Steemit id in the above table. (SP does not matter, it’s about your support towards the participants) It’s a voluntary task and what you have to do is just browsing the tag #partiko-contest and support those good entries. Voting % is arbitrary, you can vote with any % you like. Please support us and the great artists on Steemit. :)
