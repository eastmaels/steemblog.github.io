Hello my Steemit friends, 

The Steemit community in Hong Kong is growing bit by bit every day. However, I have noticed that many high-quality blog posts from the newbies are often neglected, and I just realised that there is still a feature on Steemit that I still haven’t fully utilised - “RESTEEM”

Therefore, I have decided to pick some high-quality posts from the Hong Kong community and resteem them every day, starting today. Hope this can help them to reach a larger audience and alleviate the problem. 

Hope you will enjoy their content. Welcome to support and upvote their posts if you genuinely enjoy their content. Let’s make Steemit a better place together. Thank you. :)
