Until recently, I finally realised that I still hv a lot of HUNT tokens, so I have decided to sell it. (Though it's a bit late)

To get your tokens, you have to enter your Ethereum address. If your browser has already have Metamask installed, it will be very convenient, just sign it and it will automatically connect to your wallet.

You can only withdraw 10,000 Hunt tokens every day.

Where to sell? Of course it's Daybit!

and you have to sell it for Bitcoin and withdraw your tokens.

I successfully withdraw to my Crypto.com account, and I intended to use the earn function there to earn some interest！
