Recently, as I am using the telegram app as a way reaching out to other Steemit users, I accidentally found out a telegram bot called Robot cash, and you can play it for free or deposit money in it.

This is what it looks like, and I have 4 v1.00 robots so far. 200 gems in the payout balance but it needs 1000 for minimum withdrawal.

Acquire daily gems and buy some robots and they will produce energy. It's just like cloud mining but it is not really mining, and I searched for "Robot Cash" and found out that there are videos about it with withdrawal proof, but I still keep skeptical about it. Can anyone tell me that is it working?

If anyone would like to try it out, you can use my referral link: t.me/RobotCashBot?start=NTeMIrmS
