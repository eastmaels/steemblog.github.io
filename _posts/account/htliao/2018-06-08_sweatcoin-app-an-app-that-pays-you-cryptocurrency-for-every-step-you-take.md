## Hunter's comment
Sweatcoin is founded by a team based in London. If Bitcoin is mined using your computer's hashing power and Steem is mined through your social networking activities, then Sweatcoin is mined using your outdoor steps. The app uses the accelerometer and GPS in your smartphone to accurately calculate your outdoor steps and avoid cheating. Every 1000 steps can be converted to 0.95 Sweatcoin. Now you can even watch a short video ad to claim your daily bonus. 

So what can the coins used for? Sweatcoin is currently not available for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges, but you can use the coins to buys some products and services from the store, including curved Samsung TV, PayPal Cash, and even iPhone 8! You can also send the coins to your friends. 

Isnâ€™t it another good motivation to spend more times outdoor walking and jogging, and build a fit body? The app also provides a neat interface to let you check your daily progress.
