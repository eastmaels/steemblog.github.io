Crypto.com has expanded its card issue to APAC region such as countries like Japan, Korean and Taiwan.

# I just got my card and it's super sexy! 

metal card, heavy and gives me a sense of security.

You can also earn some MCO cashback and other benefits like airport lounge, Netflix and Spotify 100% rebate with higher tiers cards.

# Never have imagined that using Bitcoin or other crypto in my daily life, but this card makes it possible now!


It's the best wallet I used so far, and I am using it every day.

They even released their latest roadmap and exchange, which shows their ambitious plan!

You will find the country being Singapore when you are filling in the address information, but it's alright, just neglect it and submit your address and the team will handle it for you. You can now register for a free card or get cards with higher tiers with MCO tokens staked.

If you are interested, you can download it via my referral link:https://platinum.crypto.com/r/cb2bjdzqyk
and we can both get $50 worth of MCO, in USD! It will automatically appear on your wallet balance once you pass KYC, but you need to stake 50 MCO to unlock them, since this is a promotional campaign.
