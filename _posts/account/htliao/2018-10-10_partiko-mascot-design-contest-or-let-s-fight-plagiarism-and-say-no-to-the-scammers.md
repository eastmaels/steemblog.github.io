The Partiko Mascot Contest is now officially over and we are so happy to see so many wonderful entries submitted. @partiko will be responsible for selecting the final winners, please be patient. :) However, recently I have encountered some entries which involve plagiarism and I am here to say NO to the scammers, and that’s why I think including drawing procedures in the selecting criteria is SO important.

Some entries seem to be directly copied from the existing pictures found on google. Here are some of the examples that I found:
