Hello my Steemit friends,

![groupp.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZM6p7Wrb7mepUcsnmUn6WErgfQq8q8rpNaHm8Athaq9Y/groupp.jpg)



 This weekend @rivalhw held the first Steemit Guangzhou meetup, attended by 20 people. Our cn community links people from all walks of life together and I was excited that I was able to join the Steemit Guangzhou Meetup, and I am going to share with you guys the exciting moments during the event!

The venue was well decorated and we even have a large red banner at the entrance. Chinese style!

Nice decoration!

During the meetup, we played games, had a lucky draw and we have a sharing session to let people know more about each other. It was fun!

Even @sweetsssj has recorded a video and share her valuable experience as a Steemian to us.

I took many photos with my Steemit friends there. 

I think communities will take one of the crucial roles in STEEM's future development and growth, and through meetups we can really get to know more about each other and build stronger bondings and sense of belonging to the community. If you want to see more meetups coming in the future, please upvote the post and support us.
