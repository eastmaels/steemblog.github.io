Just woke up in the morning and found that Ethereum has touched $280. I really can't believe my eyes that Ethereum is moving so quick. Remember that when I bought some with 1 BTC around a month ago, it was just around $85, and it has already risen for more than 3 times in just a single month. I am so regretted that I did not put more money in Ethereum. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

Which one do you guys think has a brighter future? Ethereum or Bitcoin, or just, Steem?
