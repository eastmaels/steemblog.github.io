Recently there are a number of newbies entering the Steemit community and many of them may not has English as their own language. As a chance, I totally understand sometimes it's not rare for us to experience a lack of vocabulary. For instance, when we talk about Bitcoin price, we can only say Bitcoin increases, increases and increases, or Bitcoin falls, falls, and falls. That does not look nice, isn't it?

So now I am going to introduce some words that we usually use and the words that can replace them.

# Increase
* Rise
* Grow 
* Mount 
* Go up
* Soar
* Ascent
* Rocket
* Heighten 
* Escalate
* Surge

# Fall
* Drop
* Plunge
* Sink 
* Descend
* Decline
* Dwindle 
* Diminish
* Flag

# Words used to describe the degree of change
* Substantial
* Massive
* Dramatic
* Huge 
* Rapid
* Significant 
* Slight
* Modest
* Gradual
