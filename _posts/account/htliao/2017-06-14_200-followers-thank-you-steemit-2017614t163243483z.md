Yup, it's me again. Just after two day when my 150th follower is reached, now I have more than 200 followers. And I would like to thank you all people who have followed me and upvoted my post! Steemit is such a great platform that one can easily earn money and interact with people from all corners of the globe.

I would like to tell you that, you can do exactly the same as what I have done, it's not hard to do so. 

As a Chinese and a programmer, my English is not very good but Steemit also provides an excellent opportunity for me to improve my writing and language. It's really a great platform.

Actually, since there are many new people signed up for Steemit recently, I have some useful tips for them, but I don't want to repeat again so I just put the link here below:

Steemit is really a good platform with awesome people and information. Wish you all succeed in Steemit and earn a lot of Steem, may the STEEM be with you. STEEM ON.

I write blogs about silver coins, travel and food, so please visit my older posts if you are interested.
