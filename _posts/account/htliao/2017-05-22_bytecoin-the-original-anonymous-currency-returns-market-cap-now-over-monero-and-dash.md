While everyone's eye is on Ethereum and Bitcoin, celebrating their breakthrough through $2000 and $150, one crypto which no one paid attention, bytecoin, has surged almost ten times in May alone, and its market cap now rank 6-8 while its market cap is beyond 20 in the beginning of the month.

Bytecoin daily trading volume increased from $340,000 to a staggering $48 million, and its market cap goes beyond Dash(once 4th) and Monero.

Prior to the existence of Monero, Bytecoin was heavily criticized due to its premine scheme and for that reason, the Monero development team refused to collaborate with the Bytecoin development team. In 2015, Monero lead developer Riccardo Spagni, better known as FluffyPony, stated:

“The reality is that 82% of the coins were already mined before its ’public’ release. Even if the premined coins weren’t done so maliciously, it still means 82% of the coins in the hands of persons unknown and invisible. It basically centralises a decentralised currency.”

So, is it a real uptrend or just scam and a classic pump and dump?
