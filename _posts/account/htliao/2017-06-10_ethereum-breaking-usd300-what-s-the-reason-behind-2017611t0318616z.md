It's just half a day after Ethereum reaches $280, and it has now successfully gone through the $300 level. Will it be able to hold at the $300 level?

Will the next version of Ethereum, Metropolis be released in summer? Or is there any good news for Ethereum? Even when it's great potential opponent EOS is about to have its ICO and come into the crypto market?

Just now I have transferred some of my Steem dollars to Bittrex and bought ETH. Anyway, Steemit is really a great platform to earn cryptocurrency! Glad to get started with it.

Please do leave your comments of why you think Ethereum is soaring right now!
