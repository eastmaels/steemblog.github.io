Hello Steemians, today i am going to introduce Hida beef to you. Hida beef is a highly esteemed brand of wagyu in Japan. The place Hida is also the place where the famous Japanese animation film "Your name" took place

I went to a famous restaurant called Maruaki to try the famous Hida beef. First I ordered an assorted A5 Hida beef set.

It is delicious and juicy! And the texture and flavor is just fabulous and it only costs 9800 Japanese Yen for the 400g A5 Hida Beef.

Then I tried the best A5 Hida Beef there, which costs 12000 Japanese Yen for only 200g, but it had too much fat and I didn't like it very much.

FAT FAT FAT FAT FAT AND FAT...

So a higher price doesn't always mean it is the best, remember to try  the beef of medium price when you visit Hida next time, not only will you save your wallet, but also your impression on Hida beef.
