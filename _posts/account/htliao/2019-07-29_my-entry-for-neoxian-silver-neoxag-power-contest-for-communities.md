Hello my Steemit friends, 

![CONTEST.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmR9UuBvsZNm1o8SFY5qrAu6i4dAQ8YGNyxyUKQUwWrCVS/CONTEST.png)

 I feel very excited after reading the [post](https://steemit.com/neoxianpowercontest/@zaku/neoxian-silver-neoxag-power-contest-for-communities-or-or-10k-neoxag-power-or-or) by @zaku because I really feel that our communities @team-cn, @ocd, @cn-buddy, @fundition and @cn-curation deserve this delegation for providing guidance and help to the newbies in the Chinese community. 

Why @team-cn deserves the delegation?

China population is equivalent to around 18.41% of the total world population, and the influence of the cryptocurrency  communities in China cannot be overlooked. It needs China's participation to make STEEM a huge success and @team-cn has been actively helping newbies to get started on the STEEM blockchain, providing useful information and tips for the minnows to grow. It also sponsors the contests run by the community members to let members interact and have fun on STEEM. @team-cn also conducts interview with the newbies and the active members in the Chinese community, it acts as a bridge to build up the bonding and friendship among the members. Delegation can greatly foster the development of @team-cn and provides more resources for this great project.

You can read more about what @team-cn has done here:

It may impress you!

Meanwhile, our community members also share articles about STEEM through other social media, such as Telegram, YouTube, WordPress and Facebook.

Why @cn-curation deserves the delegation?

@cn-curation is a project under @team-cn. Each day, a member of the editing group selects two undervalued articles (typically less than $0.4 worth of upvote) from the CN community and writes a summary for each article, and the authors can receive NBC as a reward. @cn-curation has been running for a year, and it has now reached Volume #334, rewarding over 700 undervalued Chinese articles. Delegating to @cn-curation can greatly improve the payout of the newbies' posts and retain these new Chinese users.

Why @fundition deserves the delegation?
With the delegation, @fundition can provide more support to the people in need and the great projects.

Why @cnbuddy deserves the delegation?
 @cnbuddy has been actively helping the authors in the Chinese community and improves their payout.

Why @ocd deserve the delegation?
@ocd is a project run by @acidyo and @anomadsoul for years, it recommends undervalued posts with various languages and greatly improves their payout. Without @ocd's work, many authors may just feel disappointed and leave STEEM.
