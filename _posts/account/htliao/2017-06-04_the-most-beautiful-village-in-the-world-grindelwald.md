Last Christmas, I went to Switzerland and it was really a great country, though the living standard is too high there and I could barely afford it. The scenery of the village is spectacular, the mountains, snow and the cottages there formed a beautiful picture, which was breathtaking. ![IMG_2734.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQgRJgo9ofgp99YVxUxAL8R6arP2BQNhkcn2F4ah4vPTu/IMG_2734.jpg)![IMG_2745.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmXgBsMbtF85DZWDKCj1QN9KaTU3xXYCemvcD6n6MoEN7b/IMG_2745.jpg)

There were also a lot of things to play nearby, paragliding, skiiing and snowboard, and the food there was very good too. The place nearby, Interlaken, is another place that you must visit.

The little train is so cute and its probably the symbol of Switzerland.

And also, don't forget to visit the Top of Europe, Jungfrau, so freezing cold there.
