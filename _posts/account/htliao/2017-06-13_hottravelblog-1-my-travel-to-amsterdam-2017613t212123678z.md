Last year, I went to Europe and travelled with
my girlfriend. We first went to Belgium and then it was our next stop, Amsterdam.

Amsterdam is a beautiful city. There are many canals, gorgeous architecture here, forming a romantic picture.

Amsterdam is also a city with lots of freedom, you can see prostitutes everywhere in the fed light district and you can smell weeds in the air, and even try you luck in the casino.

In a nutshell, there are a lot of fun in Amsterdam, and you need to explore yourself.

Netherlands is also well-known for its cheese.
