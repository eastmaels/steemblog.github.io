Roasted pork fillet ramen in vegetable soup at Tokyo Tsukiiji. Warm up your bones with this relatively healthy ramen, it is quite unusual to see ramen with green-colour soup. Although the restaurant is called Tokyo Tsukji, it's actually in Hong Kong. xD

Follow me if you want to know more about the delicious food in Hong Kong.
