Hello Steemians today I am going to introduce my favourite mobile game, Shironeko Project. It is a hack-and-slash type ARPG for IOS and android. Shironko means white cat in Japanese, and story started with it.

You just need one finger, or two, to play this game, controlling the user movements, attack and release skills. It requires the player to have quick response.

And this is my favourite character, ネモ

The characters are so beautifully drawn that I like their drawing style very much.

I like the animation of the characters unleashing their skills

It sometimes has some cooperation events with some famous anime in Japan, for example, Hunter X Hunter
