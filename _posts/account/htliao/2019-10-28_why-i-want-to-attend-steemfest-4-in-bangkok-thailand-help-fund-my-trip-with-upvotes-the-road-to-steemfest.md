![Guangzhou.jpeg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQWB5cJFtX3QNMrp4eq1soqnVGCsiHHsq3ATb7F8gknt6/Guangzhou.jpeg)I live in Hong Kong and I joined Steemit in May 2017 and I met many great people and a lot of friends here. Before I joined Steemit, I could never imagine I would write so many words because I am a lazy person. I even met some friends from different countries, including Japan, the Philippines, United States, Czech Republic and many other different countries, which I have never dreamt of before.

I even organised several contests and many people from different countries joined, for example, I made a STEEM manga hero design contest. I was astonished by the talents and creativity of my fellow Steemians. That was a huge sense of accomplishment.

I have also been to several offline meetups to meet my Steemit friends, nice memory.

Cryptocurrency and blockchain has always been my interest since I knew about them. Now it has even become my career and I work as a research analyst in a large crypto firm.

Recently I have built my Instagram account for cryptocurrency sharing and I would probably include some introduction of Steem ecosystem as I love the ideas behind Steem. You may follow if you are interested:

I hope that as a Chinese Steemian who have been using Partiko, wherein and many other Steem dapps, I can help to bring more people to know about Steem. I would also love to hear from other brilliant Steemians in Steem Fes and have fun with them! Discussing how to get STEEM to mass adoption! Hope that I can get funded for the trip and bring more values to the STEEM ecosystem.
