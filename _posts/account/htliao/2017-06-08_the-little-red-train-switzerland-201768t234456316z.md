Switzerland is a beautiful country which has a tranquil and relaxing environment. The snowy mountains there are gorgeous and its capital city Zurich is one of the top cities that most people want to live in.

Bernina Express, which is known as the Little Red Train, is very famous, and it forms a beautiful picture with the snowy mountains nearby

The weather was very good and it was not that cold than I expected.
