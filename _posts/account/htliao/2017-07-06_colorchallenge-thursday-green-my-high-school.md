Hi my Steemit friends, 

![IMG_5192.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVx3AHRneqYrvT6dGuxqNhVVj68fhGRWEj8Td2oMZr7kw/IMG_5192.JPG)

This is my entry for today's ColorChallenge. It's my graduation photo shot in my high school with my schoolmates. Our school is very rich in green colour as there are many trees and even a football field! That's quite rare for a high school in Hong Kong. Even our school tie is green in colour! I really miss the time there and I hope that I could reverse the time and be a student again. Okay, I know I am just daydreaming. One question, can you recognise who is me in the photo?



I wish you liked this one,
