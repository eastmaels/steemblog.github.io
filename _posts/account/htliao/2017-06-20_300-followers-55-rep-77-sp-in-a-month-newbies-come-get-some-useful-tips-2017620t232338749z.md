# This is my first post after HF19. It is just AWESOME. All minnows' vote worth A LOT more 

Hello my Steemit friends, recently I have just reached 300 followers and I decided to write a short article saying how much I love the Steemit community and how I got started here.

![IMG_4954.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPoSKSStyVXc5s4gEJLxeXPGcmH9B3YHJr1PtJk6jydDP/IMG_4954.JPG)

I have just reached 300+ followers and over 100SP today, with a reputation score of 55. I am truly grateful to Steemit as I also cashed out SBD with an equivalent amount of about 0.1 BTC to Bittrex, it's indeed a great platform! I love it!

There is no free lunch in this cruel world. If you just want to earn some easy money and become successful without effort on this great platform, then you are in the wrong place. That's crucial to interact with each other, leave a comment in someone's posts, upvote and resteem the content you like and participate in some great projects that help you grow.

Therefore, today I am going to introduce two projects which I think they are particularly useful for minnows.

The first one is the Minnow Support Project. It's aim is to gather all minnows' power and help us grow. You can follow the steps in the link below to register:

Thanks @diverse-thinker for his informative post


You can chat with other members in the Discord chatroom and make a lot of friends here. @aggroed is the one who is in charge and he is a helpful person who always gives his best support and suggestions to newbies. Also, he has an unique view towards the current system of Steemit and HF19, so basically you can ask him anything and all your questions can be answered here.

# So DON'T HESITATE to join this incredible community, and we are growing rapidly

The second one is chainbb forum developed by the great developer @jesta, which has a user-friendly forum interface.

The number of users keep increasing and it's a good place to interact with other Steemians and make some noise. The platform just released its version 0.2, and the developer is willing to hear YOUR SUGGESTIONS too, so please feel free to make some suggestions using the tag chainbb-suggestions, @jesta himself will upvote your post too if you have some good suggestions.
Another website developed by @jesta, steemstats.com, is also very useful when you need to calculate your curation rewards.

That's all, hope that you all enjoy what I have shared, STEEM ON
