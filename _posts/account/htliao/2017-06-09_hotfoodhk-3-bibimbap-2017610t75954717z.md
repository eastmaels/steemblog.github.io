Bibimbap at Seoulmate Cafe. With a heavenly combination of smoked salmon, lava egg and, sweet potatoes, this Korean staple features a fun mix of flavours! The bulgogi beef burrito is the must-try dish there! Certainly an innovative gourmet!

[Seoulmate Cafe]
Address: 83, Third Street, Sai Ying Pun, Western District
