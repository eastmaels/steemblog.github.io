Dear my Steemit friends,

Well, I know my reputation is way over 65, but the topic this time is really what I want to write about. So I am still going to write a post how I demonstrate my Steem spirit!


# Attending different meetups

Steem is all about social media and of course you need to get to know make friends with other Steemians. And what better way than joining meetups and meet other Steemians in person. In the past year, I have attended a lot of meetups and become friends with many Steemians.

# Helping the authors who do not get noticed

I am a manual curator and I vote a lot of posts, especially those under the #cn tags, sometimes resteem too. I am also part of the Chinese curator team of OCD and we have already helped a lot of undervalued posts to reach more audience and get a better payout. 


# Promoting Steem at my cryptocurrency seminars

Introducing Steem token system

I have organised two cryptocurrency seminars in Kerry Hotel and mentioned STEEM as one of the top 10 potential coins in 2018. Many people are interested in the ideas behind Steem and some of them even registered an account on Steemit!

# Building Steem Hong Kong community through telegram

![85FA1ED9-5245-40B0-9FEE-8C939F4653DD.jpeg](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmatgwKWipsWvKgET14rULvoDLdnw6LYs6WMMsuVnQMkZZ)


I created a telegram group and let all Steemians in Hong Kong join, sharing their ideas and having casual chat in the group. So far there are more than one hundred people in the group. 

# Asking others to join this competition 

It’s an excellent competition and I would like to see more Steemians show how they demonstrate their Steem spirit, so I have resteemed the post and asked the people of my community to join. For example, @prch has just made one - [Smells like Steem Spirit - My entry](https://steemit.com/steemspirit/@prch/smells-like-steem-spirit-my-entry)

# A lot more to come...

I am currently doing a community project with @aaronli, @prch and @honoru and all of them are Steemians with paramount passion. For details, please stay tuned. 

Thanks for reading, let’s make Steem great together. :)
