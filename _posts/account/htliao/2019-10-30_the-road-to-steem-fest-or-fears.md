Steem Fest is just a few days to go, it's already the end of October now! Being in an unfamiliar city with a lot of strangers or Steemians who I have never met before. It may spark fear and concerns in my mind and here below are my top list of fear.

# Fear #1: Poor money management
I am afraid that I will spend too much during Steem Fest and my trip, though the food and price of goods in Thailand is relatively cheap.

# Fear #2: Getting drunk
I am not very good at drinking alcohol and drinking too much would make me feel uncomfortable, there may be some occasions involves drinking for social reason during Steem Fest.
# Fear #3: Communication
Going to Steem Fest means I am certainly going to meet people from different countries and background, we may hear different accents and languages we don't understand. I am wondering if my English proficiency level is enough and whether I can understand the jokes, way of speaking or culture by Steemians from other countries.

# Fear #4: Food poison, mosquito
There are many mosquitoes in Thailand I suppose, and my stomach may not get used to the food there, so that's a concern for me as well.

But let's put the fear aside and go to Bangkok, enjoy the Festival with our Steemit friends! I am going to write a few more posts to catch up! Thanks for @anomadsoul for offering this opportunity for latecomers like me.
