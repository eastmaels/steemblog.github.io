Have you experienced your phone or laptop running out of power when you desperately need them? The product I am going to introduce today can save you from this scenario. It’s a charger called Omni 20 USB-C.

It attracts me because 

* It powers ANYTHING at ANYWHERE. No matter if it is your phone, your laptop, camera or game device, and no matter if you are in your car, at your office or chilling by the beach!

![66FE6683-EB03-46C0-A9F7-BA5A89DB3513.jpeg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYCDH4p1QmNoisKAiXY2EXAEmVKgCZFCTXRRL7UDmh4Cw/66FE6683-EB03-46C0-A9F7-BA5A89DB3513.jpeg)

* It has a portable size, which makes it very convenient and you can even put it in your pockets.
* It is able to charge with a rapid speed and the charger itself can be fully recharged WITHIN JUST 3 hours!! Given its large capacity, it's FAST!!
* It has a OLED Screen displaying data like battery temperature and percentage,  incoming and outgoing wattage. Looks cool!
* It’s SAFE, it even has a patented power protection system to protect the battery of your device, making its battery life longer.

- A common charger has the number of mAH ranging from 2,000 to 10,000, while Omnicharge provides 20,100 which can certainly provide the power to all the devices needed in your daily life.

If you have this charger, you will never have to worry about the battery level of any of your devices again! And you don’t even need two different chargers to charge different devices, it can all be quickly done with one SINGLE charger.
