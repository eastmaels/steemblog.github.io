Hello my Steemit friends, 

![BKK.jpeg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmXLFdeNcTDUpepN9Ar3XySq6gHSdvryYjhZ3UdLZGBNnT/BKK.jpeg)

This looks like an interesting topic. I am not a creative person but anyway I think I can give it a try. lol

Here are my 3 truths and 1 lie:

1) I started an cryptocurrency Instagram page a month ago.

2) I have been to more than 3 Steemit meetups

3)  I had a chance to take a photo with Ned

4) I had a chance to take a photo with Charlie Lee

So, which one do you think it's a lie? When you go to SteemFest then you can find the truth, if you are interested enough to do so.
