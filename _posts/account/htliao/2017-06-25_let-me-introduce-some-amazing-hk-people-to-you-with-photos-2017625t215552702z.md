Hello Steemians, we are a group of Hong Kong people who started this amazing journey on Steemit. You may have already noticed that there are a number of Hong Kong people here. Our team is growing every day and I am going to introduce some Hong Kong Steemians to you. We will keep inviting new people to join Steemit and grow the Chinese community. I believe, eventually, we will reach thousands of people and let more people register an account for Steemit. Let's make it an incredible platform ever, together! 
# Please support and follow us to make Steemit a better platform!

Special thanks to the Chinese community who show great support for minnows like us, without them we cannot have such an explosive growth, especially the Chinese witness @abit and other members of laodr-teahouse

More and more Steemians coming, we are using telegram as a means of communications and there are around 90 people in the group now! We are spreading the Steemit version of gospel to Hong Kong and the Chinese community. STEEM ON
