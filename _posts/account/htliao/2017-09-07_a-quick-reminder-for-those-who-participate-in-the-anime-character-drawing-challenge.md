Wow, the Anime Character Drawing Challenge has started for several days and many people from different countries have already submitted their entries. Frankly, I was totally amazed by the fabulous drawings by all of you. Anime characters from Dragonball, EVA, One Piece, Gundam, Naruto, Doraemon and other animes have come to life and they are depicted so vividly.

However, I have also noticed some problems in some of the entries, and they are:

* Drawings done but did not submit your entry under my comment
* Your Steemit id is missing on your drawing(You can also use another piece of paper to write your id on it and shoot a photo with your drawing together to prove that it’s your original work) 
* Chinese posts by machine translation - The Chinese looks terrible and doesn’t make any sense with A LOT OF grammatical errors(I will not upvote them and I suggest you to make your post in English if you don’t know Chinese at all)

# [DON’T FORGET TO SUBMIT YOUR ENTRY UNDER MY COMMENT HERE OR YOU WILL BE DISQUALIFIED](https://steemit.com/cn/@htliao/anime-character-drawing-challenge-or-50-sbd-prize-pool-or-50-sbd)

At last, I want to remind you that Steemit is not a place where you have finished your post and you can simply go away, expecting your post will have a high payout. If you are truly an anime lover, interact with others and upvote the posts that deserve your upvote. It is a great opportunity where many anime lovers from all corners of the world have finally come together, so don’t forget to interact and make friends with them, support each other, maybe they will even become a dolphin or whale one day, who knows. So visit #animedrawingchallenge now and support the drawings you like.

Hope that you have enjoyed this challenge. :D

動畫人物繪畫比賽進行得如火如荼，不少中文區的各位都有踴躍參與，在這先謝謝參與這次活動的各位，大家的畫功都相當不錯呢。像犬夜叉、新世紀福音戰士、SLAMDUNK、龍珠入面的角色都出現了，還在大家的筆下被描繪得栩栩如生呢。

不過也發現到有些參賽作品，帖子寫好了卻沒有到我的留言下提交，大家記得到[這個帖子](https://steemit.com/cn/@htliao/anime-character-drawing-challenge-or-50-sbd-prize-pool-or-50-sbd)提交作品了, 不然我只好取消你的參賽資格啦。

還有，因為舉辦這次比賽的關係，我的Voting Power就像瀑布一樣急瀉到60多%了，所以這幾天大概會調低一下投票力度讓它回復過來，回到80%以上，但中文區還有其他大神為大家點贊，相信沒問題的。

最後，有喜愛動漫的大家請支持一下 #animedrawingchallenge 標籤下的優秀作品吧，看得出有不少原創作品都是花了不少心血和時間畫的。
