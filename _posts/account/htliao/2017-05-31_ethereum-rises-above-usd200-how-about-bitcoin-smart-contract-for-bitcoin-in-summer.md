Today was a very good day for Ethereum with its price soared above $200 and ETH/BTC climbed over 0.1. The Ethereum project is probably going to release the third version, the Metropolis, in summer, and its market cap is now already 60% of that of Bitcoin.

On the other hand, Bitcoin suffers from long transaction time and high networking fee, falls short when it comes to new innovations. However, a great news for Bitcoin is here now! RSK Labs now aims to bring flexible smart contracts into the bitcoin network and it has received $3.5 in pre-Series A funding.

A production testnet, which is called Ginger, will be opened to the public according to the consensus, and more users can begin building and testing out their smart contracts on the platform, which is clearly a great news for Bitcoin investors.
