As a person who is so interested in cryptocurrency, recently the most eye-catching one for me must be EOS, so I started to do some research from scratch(YES, I knew NOTHING before) and I hope to know more about this new cryptocurrency.


All the code for EOS is written by Block.one, a Hong Kong-based company with a core team of genius software developers who specialise in Blockchain technology. Actually I was quite surprised when I found out that the company is based in Hong Kong because I live in Hong Kong!

Core Team includes: 

Name | Post | Background
-|-|-
Brendan Blumer | CEO | Businnesses involved: okay.com, 1Group
Daniel Larimer(Dan)|  CTO |  founder of Bitshares, architect of the Steem Blockchain, CEO of Cryptonomex
Ian Grigg| Partner | inventor of the Ricardian Contract, co-inventor of Triple-Entry Accounting
Brock Pierce | Partner | Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, co-founder of Blockchain Capital



Positioning: Open source platform for scalable decentralised applications

Aim: Using the new Blockchain technologies to solve the scalability issues and high fees problems which appear on DAPP platforms 

Protocol: Delegated Proof of Stake

Competitors: Ethereum, Waves, Lisk

The architect behind EOS(and STEEM also), Dan, is truly a genius and he put many brand-new ideas into his projects that are worth studying. 
# In fact, I think EOS is the best cryptocurrency that you should invest in right now.
