Bytecoin has risen drastically for 200% in a single day, and its rank also increased from beyond 20 to 10 in terms of market cap. Not along ago, its value and ranking is much below Dogecoin, and it is now also 2 times the value of Dogecoin. Is anyone watching this move and is there any reason behind this?

To get free bytecoin, you can simply use Minergate, a GUI miner to use your idle computer power to get some free bytecoins.
