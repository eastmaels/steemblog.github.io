Partiko Mascot Contest is officially over. We have received so many entries that we need some time for @partiko to select the final winners. The winners will be announced within seven days, please be patient. :)

Today Partiko also released their latest version of Partiko Android. Many new features are available and you may want to [know more about it](https://steemit.com/partiko/@partiko/partiko-android-new-release--you-new-home-awaits-etxhk5l5) and try it out.
