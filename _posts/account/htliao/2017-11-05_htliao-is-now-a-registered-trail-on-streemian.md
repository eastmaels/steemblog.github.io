I have just registered a curation trail on Streemian recently. I aim to support the good authors on Steemit, especially those in the cn and hk communities, and I need your help!

I do the curation manually and I have good curation skills in terms of getting more curation rewards.

Are you making the best use of your Steem Power and votes? If you are so busy that you don't even have time to do the curation yourself and you are willing to support the growth of the Chinese community, why don't just join my curation trail and earn yourself some curation rewards? 

Just go to [streemian.com](streemian.com), register and click "Follow". It's simple! Thanks for reading.
