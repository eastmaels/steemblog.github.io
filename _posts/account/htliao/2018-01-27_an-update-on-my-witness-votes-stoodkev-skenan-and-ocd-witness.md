Hello my Steemit friends,

![7C9AE225-7C5B-4FCF-B632-DC7A34C653ED.jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPEnrSPd9eyBdrPePsyxhQa8UBybDJ51naUvDNXwzqyxZ/7C9AE225-7C5B-4FCF-B632-DC7A34C653ED.jpeg)

 There has been a long time since I voted for a witness last time, and I want to support those witnesses who made tremendous contribution to the community by casting my witness votes. Here below is a brief introduction of the new witnesses that I cast my witness votes on. 
 
@stoodkev - a French young man who lives in Taiwan. He has developed SteemPlus & 1UP. Meanwhile, he is also a developer who involves deeply in the Utopian project 

@skenan - a Chinese witness who developed [CNsteem](https://www.cnsteem.com) - A Chinese version of Steemit.com

@ocd-witness - OCD stands for “Operation Curation Delegation” and it’s an awesome project started by @acidyo. The OCD curators from different countries search tirelessly throughout the multiple languages on Steemit for undervalued gems as provided by relatively new users and I am one of the Chinese curators of the OCD curation team. :)

Here below are some other witnesses that I voted for: 

@abit - a Chinese witness who made tremendous contribution to the Chinese community 

@steemgigs - A freelancing marketplace created by @surpassinggoogle where every Steemian can offer their unique services, expertise, products and knowledge to the whole Steemit community

@furion - an experienced developer who developed SteemData and Viewly

Thanks for your reading. Let’s support their great work and hope that they can keep bringing more values to the Chinese community and the whole Steemit community. Welcome to join me and vote for them if you wish. :)
