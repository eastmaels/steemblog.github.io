Hello Steemians, I decided to draw a card for my friend, and her favorite anime character were Sakura and Syaoran, so I used a pen and started drawing. The process was tedious, unlike pencil, I had to be careful for every line I draw because if I made some mistakes, it could not be erased. 

This was the final product:
