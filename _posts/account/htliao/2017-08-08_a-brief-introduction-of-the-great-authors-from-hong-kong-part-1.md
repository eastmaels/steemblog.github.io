A few days ago I have made a post about [our FIRST Steemit Team HK gathering](https://steemit.com/steemit/@htliao/the-first-steemit-team-hk-gathering-check-it-out) and **it has received huge response from the Steemit community**. Thank you for all resteems and upvotes from each one of you, and that was really **a tremendous encouragement** to all of us. Even @ned has resteemed my post and that made me so surprised!!!!
# Effects of our FIRST gathering
Recently, I read @donkeypong 's [Steemit Hubs and Meet Ups: An Accelerating Trend](https://steemit.com/steemit/@donkeypong/steemit-hubs-and-meet-ups-an-accelerating-trend). He is a well-known author and curator on Steemit who has initated a lot of Steemit community projects and campaigns. He expressed his views towards in-person meetings and the advantages of meeting people face-to-face. That's so true and we, the Steemit Team HK, have stronger bonds in our relationship and better understanding of each other now after the gathering. It is also nice to see so many Steemit meetups happening across the globe these days, for example, India Steemit Accelerator and Steem Cryptocurrency Meetup 2017 by @firepower, the Steemit Accelerator Hub by @donkeypong in Nigeria and Steemit University Campaign by @jassennessaj in the Philippines. This phenomenon is just awesome, spreading Steemit like a wildfire!!
# Our Aim, Vision and Values
We, the authors in Hong Kong, will try our best to **keep producing diversified, original and high quality content** and live up to your expectations. Most of us are young people who are so energetic to share our own thoughts and life, and our team has a more balanced gender ratio than the average ones, so we can bring more girly topics to the community. Our aim is to inject more energy, enthusiasm and creative ideas into the whole Steemit community. :)
# Introduction of the great authors
Now I am going to introduce some HK Steemians and their post series to you. Please feel free to follow the authors whose contents make you feel interested.

I think I would just stop here and next time I will introduce more great authors from Hong Kong to you, please stay tuned and support the younger Steemians. We certainly need your support and encouragement.

致中文區的朋友：
前幾天我的香港聚會帖子引發了不少迴響，收到了不少外國朋友的支持和回覆，甚至還被 @ned resteem了，真是令我受寵若驚。在此謝謝每一位中文區好友的支持和鼓勵，感激不盡。
舉辦這次聚會後，對大家彼此的認識和了解都多了一點，也有機會一睹各位的盧山真面目，這大概就是真人聚會的好處吧。(一哥 @myfirst 和 @elfkitchen你們早了一點點來香港，不然大概就能來參加聚會了。 LOL) @jubi @oflyhigh下次等你們來,我們再舉辦一次聚會？

最近也留意到世界各地也開始有不少Steemians有在舉辦線下活動和推廣Steemit了, 像 @firepower 在印度的India Steemit Accelerator and Steem Cryptocurrency Meetup 2017， @donkeypong在Nigeria舉辦的Steemit Accelerator Hub和 @jassennessaj在菲律賓推廣的Steemit大學運動，Steemit的前途一片光明呢 ，大家快把錢投進去吧！！ LOL
也趁此千載難逢的機會向外國朋友介紹一下香港區的優秀雙語作者。這次介紹的作者相信大家都認識了~~，特別是妹紙~~，就不再多費唇舌介紹多一遍了，看得懂英語的朋友可以抽空看看，我都花了不少心機寫的，還望各位朋友多多支持，各位也可以趁這個機會多多了解我們的帖子系列。

# 注意：此帖子的SBD收入將會平分給所有在此帖介紹的作者。
