> 每天，我們都會走不少路，足跡踏遍城市的每個角落甚至各個國家，但你可曾想過能用你走過的每一步轉化成有價值的東西或者能幫助有需要的人嗎？cn區裏好像也有些人有跑步的習慣，很健康呢，如果這些步數也能充份利用又怎樣呢？現在就有兩個手機應用能幫你做到這兩點了。以下就是這兩個手機應用的介紹：

Every day, we walk a lot and our steps are everywhere in the cities and even other countries, but have you thought of that you steps worth money? Or they can be used to do something good for the needy? I believe many of us have a jogging habit and your steps can be fully utilised using the two apps below:


# Sweatcoin

> 如果說比特幣是透過電腦運算來「挖礦」，Steemit是透過社交來「挖礦」，這個手機應用就是透過在戶外走的步數來「挖礦」。它利用了手機內的加速度計和GPS來計算用戶的戶外步數，每1000步就能轉化成0.95個Sweatcoin。它是由一隊由倫敦來的團隊開發的。

If Bitcoin is mined using your computer's hashing power and Steem is mined through your social networking activities, then Sweatcoin is mined using your outdoor steps. The app uses the accelerometer and GPS in your smartphone to accurately calculate your outdoor steps and avoid cheating. Every 1000 steps can be converted to 0.95 Sweatcoin. The team is based in London.

> 這是我的帳戶哦，我可產生了970個Sweatcoin呢，還能在這看看每日走路的進度，有跑步的朋友可以紀錄下每日的進程呢！

I have connected the app with my own Facebook account. I have generated 970 SWC so far, and you can also view your stats here. The joggers can also easily check their daily progress here.

> 雖然現在SWC不能兌換成真實的金錢，但你可以透過SWC兌換很多不同的產品如Apple Watch 2、Snapchat Spectacles等超正的產品。

Although the Sweatcoins cannot be converted to real money now, they can be used to buy many different products and services which also include some awesome products like Apple Watch 2 and Snapchat Spectacles. I just can't wait to get one for myself!

> 創辦人Oleg Fomenko還說他打算把Sweatcoin轉化為真正的金錢，成爲虛擬貨幣呢！

The co-founder and CEO, Oleg Fomenko, said that his aim is to let Sweatcoin to be converted to real money one day!

> 中國人常說「日行一善」，相信大家都不會陌生，也不會吝嗇於幫助身邊有需要的人。這款手機應用卻能使你一毛錢都不用花，只是透過走路就能幫助有需要的人。

It's our nature to help the people around us who are in need, and we shouldn't hesitate to do so. However, we may not have sufficient money or we are just too lazy to donate money to charity. This mobile app can help solving this situation, you don't even need to spend a dime to donate money to charity with this awesome app.

> 你每走一里路，這個手機應用都會幫你找一間贊助你的公司捐出0.25美金給你指定的慈善機構，是你所選擇的哦。無論是兒童、露宿者、動物或患某種病的人你都可以選擇幫助他們，有非常多有著不同目標的慈善機構，你一定能找到一間與你理念相符的。

Every mile you walk is sponsored by a company which cooperates with Charity Miles. You just need to walk, and they will do the rest. You can even choose a specific cause to donate the money. There are a lot of charitable organisations to choose which have different aims and targets. You can help people with cancer, the homeless , children and the people with a specific kind of disease.

> 好像我就相信擁有清潔的飲用食水是每個人的基本權利，所以很多時候都會選擇這個機構。


For example, I believe that everyone has the basic human rights to have access to clean drinking water, so I often choose this charity.

> 截至2017年五月，已經有超過二百萬美金捐出給各個慈善機構了。

There is already over two millions of US dollars are raised and donated to charity up to May, 2017.

> 它還能與Facebook接通，查看你每日走了多少路，我總共也走了300多里路，希望多些人下載這個手機應用，以後能幫助更多有需要的人呢！

You can also connect with your own Facebook account and check your records. I have already walked for more than 300 miles and I hope that more people will find this useful and help more people in need.
