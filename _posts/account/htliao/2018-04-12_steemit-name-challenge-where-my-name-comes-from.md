Recently, I found myself nominated by @djynn and @joythewanderer to join the #steemitnamechallenge. It seems fun and I am joining it. 

<hr>

# Rules

Here are the rules of the challenge in case you are 'lucky' enough to be asked:
1. Tell us in a post how you chose the current Steemit username you have. The story behind it.
2. Tell us your real name!
3. If you could change your current username, which name would you choose and why? If you have a possible usernames list, mention it!
4. Use the tag #steemitnamechallenge so that anyone who cares at all can track all the posts and check them out
5. Nominate 5 unfortunate souls for this challenge
<hr>

Although I may not follow all of the rules above, I think I’d share where my username comes from anyway.

If you are familiar with Chinese language, then you will probably know how my username comes from. In short, HT is the initials of my first name and Liao is my surname. 

Obviously, I choose this username because I just treated it as Instagram accounts and didn’t pay attention to the privacy issues. LOL Alright, it’s fine. 

If I could change my current username, I would probably choose @cryptowarrior. Since cryptocurrency market is like a battlefield, and we have to be well equipped to prepare for the fight every day. I am fascinated by cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. That’s the reason I want to share some useful information regarding different cryptocurrency and the market with my readers, but this username has already been taken. LOL

Now I'd like to nominate a few Steemians whose names I'm always curious of. They are:

@sweetdisaster, @moneybaby, @honoru, @softmetal, @perlia

Thanks for reading. Have a good day!
