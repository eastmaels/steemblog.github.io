Yesterday, Steem was only trading at $1.5 and all of a sudden, it has already risen to $2.6 today, extremely bullish with more than 66% in merely a week. It is a very good news for the Steemians like you and me! Every post u make is now worth much more! Steemit starts getting more and more attention and users, don't ever give up on making a post and share your opinion with others.
