Every time when I tried to introduce Steemit to my friends, they asked me one question, “Is there any app?” 

Yes, people nowadays tend to spend a lot of time on their smart phones and they don’t use computers for blogging and social networking anymore.

Therefore, the crux of bringing STEEM to the mass lies on a successful mobile app, a cool and user-friendly one that everyone loves to use, and today we finally have one - Partiko.

In the past, only Android version is available and I am an iPhone user so I can’t try out this amazing app. Now the IOS app has been released and I can’t put to test out different features of this app. Just download it from App Store. Very convenient. 

The interface is neat and clean, cool design!

You can even know who are your biggest supporters. 


Another bonus point is the notification system, I often miss those who mention my name in their posts because Steemit doesn’t have a notification system, and Partiko makes it happen, it has greatly improved the interaction on the STEEM blockchain. Great work! 

Being launched for merely several months, Partiko has already become the #2 mobile app on the STEEM blockchain, even one of the most renowned author here, @stellabelle, use Partiko!
