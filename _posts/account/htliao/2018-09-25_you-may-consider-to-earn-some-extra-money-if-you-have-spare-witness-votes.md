Recently I discovered a project called @steemhq and it’s very easy to join it! You just need to [spend one of your witness votes](https://steemconnect.com/sign/account-witness-vote?witness=steemhq.witness&approve=1) and you can get **FREE** votes. From my experience, it’s quite hard to use all 30 votes, and even me, a Steemian who have been on this platform for more than one year, still have 18 votes left, so why don’t use one of them to earn some STEEM and Steem Power for yourself?

It visited my post quickly after I wrote a post. Though it only accounts for $0.01 of the post payout, it’s not that insignificant if you put the recent STEEM price into your calculation. After all, my full vote can only generate $0.44 now, so an additional $0.01 is not bad. Moreover, You can also cancel your vote anytime if you are not satisfied, so why don’t give it a try?
