This challenge is organised by @anomadsoul and it’s a fun one! Please take a look at his original post if you want to join this challenge too!

As an olde user, I am happy to know that Eric launched the challenge and gives us all an opportunity to let other Steemians to know more about us by selecting 10 posts that we want everyone to read.

The first post I would like to share is [my “Introduce Yourself” post](https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@htliao/hi-steemit-this-is-desmond-desmond). At that time, I had already been on the platform for some days, and finally I decided to show my face and verification photo. Hope this can help newcomers to know more about my personal life.
