As a witness, you must've known that being at a higher position in the witness ranking table gives you more opportunity to produce a block. And... you are rewarded a certain amount of Steem Power for the witnessing work. 

To see how often do you and when are you expected to produce your next block, you could read my previous posts:
1. [AWK Tutorial: When are you expected to produce your next witness block?](https://helloacm.com/awk-tutorial-when-are-you-expected-to-produce-your-next-witness-block-steemit/)
2. [AWK Tutorial: How often do you generate a Witness Block?](https://helloacm.com/awk-tutorial-how-often-do-you-generate-a-witness-block-steemit/)

You probably want to know how many blocks you have produced in the last 24 hours, so you have a rough idea that how much SP you are rewarded per day.

Now, you can, easily, with the following updates.

## Discord SteemIt Bot

## Online Witness Tool
The tool: [Steemit Witnesses List - Unvote Inactive Witnesses](https://helloacm.com/tools/steemit/witness/)

*Please Note that It may really take a while before you see the result... and yes, I admit I have to improve the performance at some point.* 

**Update:** Speed is greatly improved by combining multiple queries into one. ^_^
