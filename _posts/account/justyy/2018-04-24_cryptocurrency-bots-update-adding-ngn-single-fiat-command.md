Recently my [discord](https://helloacm.com/steem-blockchain-information-api-discord-and-wechat/) bot [cryptocurrency](https://helloacm.com/london-cryptocurrency-show-steem-is-the-no-1-blockchain-in-the-world/) has been added to quite a few servers and I've one feedback that the *NGN* currency is not supported.

The NGN stands for Nigerian Naira.

The Fiat data is obtained from coinmarketcap which has only supported a few Fiat symbols.

I've added the source from cryptocompare and restructured the code a little bit, finally it supports more fiats (including NGN) now!

Another update is to support the single fiat command so you can easily see how much it is worth to USD.
