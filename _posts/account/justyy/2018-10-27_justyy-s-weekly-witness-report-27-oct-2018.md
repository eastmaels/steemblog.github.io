# API Severs
3 API servers have been upgraded from 0.16.10 yarkey to 0.18.04 bonic. Two more to go!

# SteemSQL
According to @arcange ,
> My servers generate more than *600000 queries* per day with *3 billion* I/O.

I have partially reduced the number of queries by caching and written a script (using NodeJs or Python) to read the blockchain and save the latest posts (3 days) to files or database locally...

This is for supporting the CN community by providing some free services such as curation, RSS...

## Delegate to @justyy
@justyy runs a automatic delegation service for nearly a year now. Delegate to @justyy for at least 5 SP and start receiving daily payout as interests (from 8% to 10% APR). Also, as a supporter, the delegators will start to receive complimentary/curation upvotes (as a thank you) per day from e.g @justyy and a few other curation trails. For more information, [read this](https://github.com/DoctorLai/steemit-wechat-group). The voting weight algorithm is [open source](https://steemit.com/busy/@justyy/bank-of-china-implements-a-new-voting-algorithm).

- Delegate to @justyy - [at least 5 SP to join (automatically)](https://steemyy.com/sp-delegate-form/?delegatee=justyy)
- [Undelegate to @justyy (Quit) - SP returned by steem blockchain in 5 days](https://steemyy.com/sp-delegate-form/?delegatee=justyy&amount=0)
- [View Current Delegators/Supporters](https://steemyy.com/delegators/?id=justyy)

> Please note that the SP you enter is the final amount to delegate. For example, if you already delegate 10 SP and you want to delegate another 5 SP, you will need to enter 15 SP (instead of 5 SP) in the delegation form.
