# Witness Back and Upgraded to 20.6 - after 35 hrs offline and Backup Server Enabled!
![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmRV9iZ8saGrawAq7YeS2HTFgN2EskQ23SQK9TYzygYyU3)

I started upgrading to 20.6 at Saturday night without a backup server. It took longer than I expected because:
1. witness server is only 50GB RAM.
2. ZRAM enabled (compressedï¼‰
3. Main CPU Frequency is only 2100 MHz

I thought `witness` plugin is the same thing as `witness_api` thus I removed it and when replay was around 90% - I made another mistake by `./run.sh restart` - because I thought it will reload the configuration. **Lessons Learned!**

It took another 10+ hours because the reindexing had to re-start from beginning.

I thought it would be great to have a backup server in the future because during the offline, I lost three votes.. And most importantly, **being a witness means responsibility to produce blocks when needed.** We all need to minimize the downtime.

I spent another *fortune* to rent another VPS - as a backup. Both are now fully synchronized to 20.6 blockchain.
