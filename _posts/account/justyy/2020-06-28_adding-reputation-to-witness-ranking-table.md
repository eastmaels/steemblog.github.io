I thought it would be a good idea to add the column "reputation" to the witness ranking table.

The reputation is just an indicator but nothing more. For instance. the reputation 25 usually means the steemian has just recently newly joined.

The reputation is formatted in such a way that below 25 is marked as red. The reputation data is also integrated in the API under the account_data section.

Finally the PHP function to format the reputation is given [here](https://helloacm.com/steem-reputation-format-function-in-php/).

Every little helps! I hope this helps!
