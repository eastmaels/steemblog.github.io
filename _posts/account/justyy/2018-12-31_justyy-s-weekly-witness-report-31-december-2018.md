# Weekly Witness Update 
As a witness, I feel it is useful to have a weekly report, which will be produced every weekend at the hashtag #witness-report

## Block produced in last 7 days
77 blocks (↑3) produced in last 7 days and rewarded 172783.1441 VESTS in total (approximately 85.6209 Steem Power).

## Witness Summary
Rank 66 ( ↓ 1 place) - Total Votes: 12446 MVs ↑  and 708 Voters→ . Total: Missed 26 Blocks. (0 - Miss this week). Feed published every 2 hours smoothly.

## Delegation
@justyy is the 7-th most delegated ([289 Delegators  ↑](https://steemyy.com/delegators/?id=justyy)) project on steem blockchain (See below).

The steem price is low and hence more delegations to @justyy as his delegation return APR% still stays the same.

## Revenue and Expenses
1. Monthly SteemSQL  cost: 10 SBD
2. Monthly Costs for Two Witness Nodes: around 100 USD
3. Monthly API server costs: around 150 USD 
4. Monthly Domain Costs: 5 USD
And not to mention time and efforts spent on:  developing new tools, monitoring and upgrading the witness servers. It is profitable only (especially under such low STEEM price) if you are at Top 50, so please do support me by [voting me as a witness](https://steemconnect.com/sign/account_witness_vote?approve=1&witness=justyy) or [set as a witness proxy](https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/account-witness-proxy?proxy=justyy&approve=1). Thanks.

I like STEEM and I do believe the STEEM - that is why I have been spending money and efforts on being a witness and promoting STEEM community via developing tools/applications, providing APIs, helping Utopian moderating work etc.

## Delegate to @justyy
@justyy runs a automatic delegation service for a long time. Delegate to @justyy for at least 5 SP and start receiving daily payout as interests (from 8% to 10% APR). Also, as a supporter, the delegators will start to receive complimentary/curation upvotes (as a thank you) per day from e.g @justyy and a few other curation trails. For more information, [read this](https://github.com/DoctorLai/steemit-wechat-group). The voting weight algorithm is [open source](https://steemit.com/busy/@justyy/bank-of-china-implements-a-new-voting-algorithm).

- Delegate to @justyy - [at least 5 SP to join (automatically)](https://steemyy.com/sp-delegate-form/?delegatee=justyy)
- [Undelegate to @justyy (Quit) - SP returned by steem blockchain in 5 days](https://steemyy.com/sp-delegate-form/?delegatee=justyy&amount=0)

*@justyy is the 7-th delegated project on steem blockchain*

> Please note that the SP you enter is the final amount to delegate. For example, if you already delegate 10 SP and you want to delegate another 5 SP, you will need to enter 15 SP (instead of 5 SP) in the delegation form.
