In response to [Soft Fork 22.2](https://steemit.com/steem/@softfork222/soft-fork-222), I have just upgraded my Witness Node to 0.22.2!

And it now shows 0.22.2 as expected.

As a backup witness that is ranked more than 50, my main concern is to be able to produce blocks - i.e. secure the steem blockchain.

I can understand why most Top 20 witnesses are in favor of the proposal and want to protect the steem blockchain for the best interests.

IMHO, this is a compromise and temporary solution - we want to protect the blockchain also we want to be censorship resistant.

Steem On!
