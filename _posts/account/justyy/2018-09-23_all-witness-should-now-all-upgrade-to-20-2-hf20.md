The HF20 is scheduled on 25/September and all witnesses by updating to 20.2 cast their votes of HF20 (hard fork)

From @drakos [online tool](https://steemian.info/witnesses), we can see already 17 out of top 20 witnesses are running on 0.20.2 - which is great and that <del>urges</del> suggests the other witnesses to upgrade to 20.2 or otherwise they won't be able to produce blocks on/after 25/September. However, witnesses can choose not to upgrade to HF20 if they do not agree the changes.

## My witness updates
OK, unfortunately, my [VPS server](https://helloacm.com/vps-tool-api-server-upgraded-to-four-cores/) is scheduled to be offline (exactly on the day of HF20) due to unforeseen maintenance - what is all about 25/Sept/2018 - so many things happening not to mention the dlive's leaving [steem](https://helloacm.com/steem-witness-updated-to-0-19-6-and-server-using-zram/) on that day as well.

So, after a second thought, (to avoid the downtime) at the meantime I have started my backup witness server, which is currently replaying the HF20 (v20.2) and should kick in soon.

## Embrace HF20!
Thanks the hardwork from @steemit and all active witnesses especially the top 20, we have such an amazing community! We should be all proud!
