I have moved the Steem Feed Publishing to a VPS - this is now a totally different server/location than the one that runs the steemit witness.

## Server for publish the feed
4 Cores (2.4 GHz), 8 G RAM, 80 G SSD

## Feed published every 4 hours
As suggested by @timcliff in [Witness Update: Witness Feed Now Published Every Hour!](https://steemit.com/witness-category/@justyy/witness-update-witness-feed-now-published-every-hour), I have now [scheduled it](https://helloacm.com/steem-witness-update-witness-feed-now-published-every-hour/) to be every 4 hours.

## Why another server?
So in case the steem witness down (restart, down to hardware fault), the feed server can still work without any interruption.

To reduce the overload of the witness server - now the witness server just does one thing, which is to produce blocks.

## Other updates
My witness node is still re-indexing and should be back very soon, please be patient and thank you for your understanding... 

Hats off to the Steem Development team @steemitblog for quickly [solving the issues](https://steemit.com/steem/@steemitblog/steem-blockchain-patch-issued). Also, i need to thank a few great witness @drakos @timcliff @therealwolf @emrebeyler etc for providing help in #witness channel of steem.chat
