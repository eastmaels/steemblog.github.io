Currently, no other tools are available showing the `Total Blocks Produced` and `Miss Rate` for a steemit witness. Therefore, I've added these two to the [following tools](https://helloacm.com/witness-tool-update-showing-total-blocks-produced-and-miss-rate/):

## Discord SteemIt Bot
Using the `w` command followed by steemit witness account prints these useful information to your [discord](https://helloacm.com/the-discord-witness-command-and-api/) channel.

Adding `steemit` to your discord channel is easy:

## Wechat Channel Bot
[Wechat](https://helloacm.com/r-tutorial-how-rich-is-steemit-wechat-group/) channel `justyyuk` supports the `w` command as well:
