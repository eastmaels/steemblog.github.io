Added another tool to broadcast witness update:

Tool URL: [https://steemyy.com/witness-update/](https://steemyy.com/witness-update/)
Chinese: [https://steemyy.com/witness-update-tool/](https://steemyy.com/witness-update-tool/)

# What this tool can do for you?
Usually, I send update using the `conductor` directly on my witness server. But sometimes when you are not able to SSH, this tool would be handy.

Click "Get Witness Information" which will retrieve the current Witness Data and populate in the fields.

A friendly advice: Set Signing Key to  `STM1111111111111111111111111111111114T1Anm` to take your witness offline if you are not able to make it! (to avoid missing blocks and be voted out)

Every little helps! I hope this helps!
