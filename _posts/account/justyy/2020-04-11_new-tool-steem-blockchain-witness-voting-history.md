This is a long weekend (Good Friday + Easter Monday). And we can only stay home due to the COVID-19. Perfect time to do some programming!

Using [SteemJS](https://steemyy.com/steemjs/), we'll be able to scan the account history for transacations. We look for the `account_witness_votes` and
`account_witness_proxy` for the witness votes.

There you go: 
https://steemyy.com/witness-votes-history/

Known Issue:
if an account has too many transactions, the page may freeze a little bit.

You'll also see logs for witness-related records (You can configure to narrow down the result in above three select boxes)

And as usual, to support CN community, this tool is also available in Chinese: https://steemyy.com/witness-votes/

I hope this helps!
