According to [here](https://wirexapp.com/blog/post/drop-everything-wxt-is-here-0157), you can now buy WXT if your are registered with [Wirex](https://helloacm.com/out/wirex)

The WXT is distributed on a first-come-first-serve basis at a fixed price of $0.01 per token for the duration of the sale. 

# Lock-up 6 month
The WXT you purchased at pre-sale will be locked-up for 6 months before you can sell them e.g. on OKEx.

# Advantages of holding a WXT
Here are the advantages:
- 500,000 WXT ($5,000) – 100% discount and 1.5% Cryptoback™
- 100,000 WXT ($1,000) – 50% discount and 1% Cryptoback™
- 50,000 WXT ($500) – 25% discount and 0.75% Cryptoback™
If you don't have any WXT, you will have:
- 1 USD/EUR/GBP monthly card fee
- 0.5% Cryptoback
So, for example, if I spend $500, what I can get extra is:
- 0.25 USD and 0.25% cash back.
Assume I use [Wirex](https://helloacm.com/out/wirex) card to spend X\*100 USD per month, then, it will need 500/(0.25+0.25\*0.01\*X\*100) months to earn the $500 back.

Example: If I spend 8\*100 USD per month, roughly it takes 220 months to earn $500 extra back
And if I spend 18\*100 USD per month, roughly it takes 105 months to earn $500 extra back.
As You probably notice that, the $5000 option may seem the most generous, however, less profitable (worse) than the first two options: $500 and $1000.

However, if you believe in 6 months, the WXT will be worth more than $0.01, then go for it!
