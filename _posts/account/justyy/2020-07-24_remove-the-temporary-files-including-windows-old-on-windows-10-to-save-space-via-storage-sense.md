Recently I found out on my C:\ there is a folder `windows.old` probably this is due to the fact that I refreshed my Windows 10 using a Recovery software from Microsoft.

<h3>Can I safely delete Windows.old Folder?</h3>
Yes, The `windows.old` contains the previous Windows installation files, and is scheduled to be deleted after 30 days by OS. Prior to then, those files are protected and can't be deleted unless you use the <a href="https://helloacm.com/how-to-make-more-storage-space-by-moving-appimagesvideos-to-sd-card-on-android-smart-phones/" title="How to Make More Storage Space by Moving App/Images/Videos to SD card on Android Smart Phones?">Storage</a> sense.

Go to Settings and Navigate to Storage

Select the Temporary Files, you will see Previous Windows Installation, Tick it and Click Remove.

By default, the Temporary Files will be kept 30 days before they are automatically removed. You can configure the ![](https://helloacm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/configure-storage-sense-or-run-it-now.jpg)

You can also configure to let it clean the files every day, week or month. This should free up your harddisk space.

Every little helps! I hope this helps!
