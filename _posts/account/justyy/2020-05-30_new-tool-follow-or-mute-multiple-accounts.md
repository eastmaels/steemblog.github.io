I need a tool to follow, mute (block), or unfollow multiple accounts at the same time. Thus I develop this tool.

Tool: Batch Follow or Mute Tool on Steem Blockchain
URL: [https://steemyy.com/follow-or-mute/](https://steemyy.com/follow-or-mute/)
Chinese Version: [https://steemyy.com/batch-follow-or-mute/](https://steemyy.com/batch-follow-or-mute/)

For example, you can use this tool to follow all your fans back (who follow you). Of course, you can also get a list of someone's following or followers, and then decide to follow, mute or unfollow them.

Currently, there are five pre-define list:

You don't need posting key to retrieve the list of followers/following. However, you do need Private Posting Key (which only stays in the browser, in the current page) to broadcast the transactions (five in a block).

I hope this helps!
