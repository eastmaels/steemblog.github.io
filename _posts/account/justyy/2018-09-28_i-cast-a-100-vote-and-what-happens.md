## HF20, what is new?
We had been expecting HF20 for a long time - but now the HF20 is here, we kinda are a little bit panic, so what is all about HF20? The most obvious change that HF20 brings is introducing mana and resources credit (RC). The previous voting power (VP) has been depreciated. 

## One example of 100% vote
I cast a 100% vote when voting mana is 60.66% and it reduces to 59.45% afterwards. Surprising, the RC isn't used - but a slight increase due to automatic restore.

Max mana isn't changed. Current mana is reduced from 64045630712730 to 62776518621168 and the difference is 1269112091562 - which is about the scale of approximate costs for a comment i.e.. 14200000000 - considering the voting mana is different.

We also notice that the cost for voting and transfer/powerups are similar - which are around 1/5 of commenting (posting).
