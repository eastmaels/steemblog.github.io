As you probably know, I also share my programming posts on my blog: https://helloacm.com   
Google Webmaster has released a new UI which allows me to visualise the clicks from Google search engine. 

Here is the graph from last 3 months that shows the number of clicks (e.g. [Traffic source analysis](https://helloacm.com/pageviews-and-search-queries-in-weekends-plus-traffic-sources-analysis/)).

So, at a glance, less [programmers](https://helloacm.com/software-engineering-jobs/) are working over weekend, the peak time are in general from Monday to Thursday and on Friday - it starts to decline when probably most companies have an early finish on Friday.

Today is Friday. Have a nice weekend all!
