My **One Year Old** PR has finally been reviewed and merged into steem-js

https://github.com/steemit/steem-js/pull/381

To be honst, I forgot the PR and I thought the @steemitdev had lost interests in maintaining this library - or the steem-js is already a dead project for a long time.

Last update made by @steemitdev was 5 months ago, so is the steem officials actually doing some work? I don't know any major changes except for  the steemitwallet.com - which does not improve the UX to be honest.

However, let's have some faith for steem and let's hope for the best and make this community bigger together!

PS:  Many thanks to  @netuoso, @roadscape, @wehmoen in no particular order. :)
