Witness Node Replayed and Upgraded to 20.5 beautifully without any problems - practice makes perfect - I have spent lots of energy in the last few days building, replaying and switching between main and backup nodes so basically nothing new except the version from 0.20.2 to 0.20.5.

> A Steem Witness is a person who operates a witness server (which produces blocks), and publishes a price feed of STEEM/USD to the network. Witnesses' computers in the Steem network have a job that is to make 'blocks' and add them to the blockchain and also to store the complete blockchain data.
