Two days ago, I got an email which worries me:

> With this newsletter, we want to inform you about an upcoming maintenance date in our Nuremberg data centre.

> The maintenance will take place on Wednesday, 29th April 2020, at 05:30 am UTC+2

> The maintenance will require a short interruption of the Internet uplink, we expect an offtime of less than 15 minutes. 

> The unavailability will only affect the Internet connection, your server/VPS will keep running throughout the maintenance and will be available immediately after we have completed the maintenance.

> No action is required from you. This e-mail has only been sent to inform you ahead of time.

All my 3 Nodes were in the same physical location, and thus affected. Immediately, to avoid Single-Point-Of-Failure, I rented another server (Dedicated Server!) in North USA.

And it just replaced one of my Servers in Germany as the main Witness Node within 2 Days! It wasn't ready before the maintainance event, but I was lucky to miss only 1 block!


Here is my updated node information: from https://steemyy.com/witness-nodes.php

To avoid single-point-of-failure, it is usually a good advice not to have servers in one single physical location - this is a lesson to learn from this incident (missing one block).


PS: I got the dedicated server from [Dacentec](https://justyy.com/out/da).

I hope this helps!
