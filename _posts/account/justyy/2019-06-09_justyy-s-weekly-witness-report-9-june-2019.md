> I am a software developer based in Cambridge, UK. I develop several tools that help enhance the steem community especially the CN.  I maintain a Steem Witness Node that supports the growth of the steem blockchain.

> I am a [Utopian Moderator](https://steemit.com/@utopian-io). I review submissions in the development category.

> I am currently the [7-th most delegated account - currently 322 delegators!](https://steemyy.com/top-delegations-by-count/) on the STEEM Blockchain.

# Weekly Witness Update 
As a witness, I feel it is useful to have a weekly report, which will be produced every weekend at the hashtag #witness-report

# Last Report
[@justyy's Weekly Witness Report - 14/May/2019](https://steemit.com/witness-category/@justyy/justyy-s-weekly-witness-report-14-may-2019) - Three weeks ago

# Witness Status

## Block produced in last 7 days
35  blocks produced in last 7 days and rewarded 79311.4 VESTS in total (approximately 39 Steem Power).

## Witness Summary

7. [Earn Free Stellar-Lumens by Learning in Two Minutes!](https://steemit.com/busy/@justyy/earn-free-stellar-lumens-by-learning-in-two-minutes)

## Delegation
@justyy is the 7-th most delegated ([322 Delegators](https://steemyy.com/delegators/?id=justyy)) project on steem blockchain (See below).

## Delegation Rewards
In last 7 days, 107 SP were given out to the [322 delegators](https://steemyy.com/delegators/?id=justyy). Thank you!

The steem price is low and hence more delegations to @justyy as his delegation return APR% still stays the same.

## Revenue and Expenses
1. Monthly SteemSQL  cost: **20 SBD** roughly 55 STEEM at current price.
2. Monthly Costs for The Witness Nodes: around 100 USD
3. Monthly API server costs: around 150 USD 
4. Monthly Domain Costs: 12 USD
And not to mention time and efforts spent on:  developing new tools, monitoring and upgrading the witness servers. It is profitable only (especially under such low STEEM price) if you are at Top 50, so please do support me by [voting me as a witness](https://steemconnect.com/sign/account_witness_vote?approve=1&witness=justyy) or [set as a witness proxy](https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/account-witness-proxy?proxy=justyy&approve=1). Thanks.

I like STEEM and I do believe the STEEM - that is why I have been spending money and efforts on being a witness and promoting STEEM community via developing tools/applications, providing APIs, helping Utopian moderating work etc.

I am not giving up .. YET, and I will keep working hard to bring something unique to the community.

**Enjoy and Steem On!**

## Delegate to @justyy
@justyy runs a automatic delegation service for a long time. Delegate to @justyy for at least 5 SP and start receiving daily payout as interests (from 8% to 10% APR). Also, as a supporter, the delegators will start to receive complimentary/curation upvotes (as a thank you) per day from e.g @justyy and a few other curation trails. For more information, [read this](https://github.com/DoctorLai/steemit-wechat-group). The voting weight algorithm is [open source](https://steemit.com/busy/@justyy/bank-of-china-implements-a-new-voting-algorithm).

- Delegate to @justyy - [at least 5 SP to join (automatically)](https://steemyy.com/sp-delegate-form/?delegatee=justyy)

## 322 Delegators! Thank you!
*@justyy is the 7-th delegated project on steem blockchain*

> Please note that the SP you enter is the final amount to delegate. For example, if you already delegate 10 SP and you want to delegate another 5 SP, you will need to enter 15 SP (instead of 5 SP) in the delegation form.
