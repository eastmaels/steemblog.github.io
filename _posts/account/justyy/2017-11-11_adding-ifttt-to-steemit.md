IFTTT (If this then that) is popular service that connects many internet applications. Currently, steemit doesn't have a 'service on IFTTT.

What can the users do if there is a IFTTT channel? The imagination is unlimited. For example, we can:

- Get comments via phone messages
- Synchronize posts via RSS feed to your blog or vice versa.
- Say thanks to somebody via Wallet when you are delegated SP.
- Upvoting or downvoting when a certain condition is met.
- Comment on your friends on their birthday.
- etc, etc.

As the IFTTT has two parts:  This and That. *This* is the trigger part, so Steemit needs to provide a list of APIs that could be easily notified i.e. events that are triggered. *That* is the action, for example, Post/Comment on steem blockchain, upvoting/downvoting, sending SBD via wallet etc.

I believe this is the game changer for Steemit if steemit wants to play a bigger role in the social network, blockchain or whatever. With IFTTT/Steem, there is a great potential and there are so many interesting stuffs we can connect Steemit to the other internet applications.
