**Enjoy and Steem On!**

## Delegate to @justyy
@justyy runs a automatic delegation service for nearly a year now. Delegate to @justyy for at least 5 SP and start receiving daily payout as interests (from 8% to 10% APR). Also, as a supporter, the delegators will start to receive complimentary/curation upvotes (as a thank you) per day from e.g @justyy and a few other curation trails. For more information, [read this](https://github.com/DoctorLai/steemit-wechat-group). The voting weight algorithm is [open source](https://steemit.com/busy/@justyy/bank-of-china-implements-a-new-voting-algorithm).

> Please note that the SP you enter is the final amount to delegate. For example, if you already delegate 10 SP and you want to delegate another 5 SP, you will need to enter 15 SP (instead of 5 SP) in the delegation form.
