I have added another backup witness server and thus having four servers in total now for the steem  blockchain.

All servers are in good health - and closely monitored. It is important that you have **different key pairs** on different servers, so you can easily switch to backup servers in case the main one upgrading e.g. replaying.  Double signing usually happens if you have the same key pairs on two servers, both trying to produce a block.
