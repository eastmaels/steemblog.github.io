I have been moderating the utopian posts  for a few weeks now and I enjoy it. The team members are nice and I did learn a lot, and that is not just the technology part.

 I am 33, currently a wireless engineer working for a Wireless company in Cambridgeshire, UK. I finished my bachelor in Computer Science with First Class degree (Huuuuray!) and right after bachelor degree, I finished my PhD in wireless [propagation modelling](https://propagationtools.com/wireless/) in 3.5 years (so I became a [Doctor](https://helloacm.com/about/) in aged 25). Yeah, so I guess my IQ is OK.

But, to me, the most enjoyable moments are when I created something that is useful or when the first time I got the correct output from programs. I like new technology and am willing to learn them. Being part of Utopian Moderating Team is Great, as I have chances to know the masterpieces created by others.

However, some others got frustrated when I rejected their work earlier.  And I learn a lot on how to deal with these unpleasant situations when my supervisors set a good example in the discord discussion channel. 

I am a passionate technology lover and I won a third National Price in [ACM (Association Computing Machinery)](https://helloacm.com/about) in high school. That is a programming contest basically you are given 3 hours time to solve a few puzzles using Turbo Pascal (at that time).

I speak native Chinese (Mandarin) and know English (fluent). I came to UK in 2004 and now settled with a lovely family. My motivation of being a Utopian moderator is to support open source projects, learn new things, and of course earn a little STEEM. :)

I have known quite a few technology such as C/C++, C#, Delphi/Pascal, Python, Lua, Javascript, [PHP](https://helloacm.com/php-function-to-get-exchange-rate-between-cryptocurrency-btc-ltc-eth-to-fiat-currency/) etc. 

Hey, in case you want to recruit me, here is my [resume in PDF](https://steakovercooked.com/documents/cv.pdf)

[Happy coding](https://helloacm.com/being-part-of-utopian-moderating-team-is-great-intro-post/), happy moderating!
