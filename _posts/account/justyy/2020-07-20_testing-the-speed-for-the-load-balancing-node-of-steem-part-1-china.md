In this post, I am going to test the page speed to the Load Balancer RPC Node for STEEM:  https://steem.justyy.workers.dev  The tool is done via the http://ping.chinaz.com/steem.justyy.workers.dev

A few comments:
1. most of China can't access api.steemit.com
2. the ping of the Load Balancing Node steem.justyy.workers.dev is still quite high in China.  
3. In order to speed up access in China, one needs to apply ICP, which is the short name for "Internet Content Provider". 

> According to Chinese regulation, all website hosted in Mainland China or content served from Chinese data centers (which is true for our China Network service) needs to obtain an ICP "BeiAn备案" or "License 证" number for every domain that serves content to your pages. These number needs to be displayed on footer of your pages.

With ICP, then we can use the CDN to speed up the access in China.

Every little helps! I hope this helps!
