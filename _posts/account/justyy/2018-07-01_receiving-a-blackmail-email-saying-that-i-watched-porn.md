A blackmail [email](https://helloacm.com/receiving-a-blackmail-scam-email-saying-that-i-watched-porn/) pops into my *work* email-address this morning, claiming that they have evidences of me watching porn...

You do not know me and you must be thinking why are you receiving this mail, correct? 
The answer is, I positioned a tracker on a site that displays erotic videos,  you used this web site to have  good time (you must understand what I mean).
While you were enjoying porn, the computer began operating as a RDP  (Remote  Desktop) with a keylogger. Obviously, all cams & screen also began recording together and after that my tracker gathered all your family and work contacts from your system. That is how I know where to contact you.
I created a split-screen video - First part displays the video you were viewing (you have a fine taste ; )), and next part displays the recording of your web cam. 
So, what  should you do? I think, $ 300 is a fair value for for not sharing this video with your contacts. You have to the deposit through Bitcoin. My bitcoin address is wallet id:
1GmCKWonZHukBzis69ZoTWSjQiPqNyqJa8
You have only 24 hours in order to initiate the payment. (I have a special pixel within this message and now I know that you are reading this e mail).
I will, no doubt, upload and send your clips to all including members of your family, colleagues if I don't receive the bitcoins.
However, if you make the payment I won't share it and I'll destroy the videos at earliest. 
If you want to have evidence reply with "Yes!" and I will send out your video recording to your 14 contacts.

I know it is totally a scam email because:
1. I couldn't remember myself watching porn last time (got too busy... and yes, I have a wife)
2. I don't have a cam set up on my desktop (I never watch porn on iPad or laptop)
3. the email does not have a 'pixel' that could indicate you have read the email.
4. I have always updated my anti-virus/firewall software to the latest - the risks of security breach are low.

I believe this type of emails are sent out everyday to quite a number of potential victims. My advices (even you did watch porn lately - but this is totally OK) are:
1. do not respond to the email.
2. do not send any bitcoins.
3. do not be bothered with it.
4. report the email sender for phishing. 
5. move on with your life.
