I use busy.org to publish a post today and I noticed that one picture was cropped.

# How to Reproduce
Drag the photo to the editor.
![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1514327282/qcp4dpouijpjlc3gbajk.png)

after 100% upload process, the photo shown in the editor is cropped,

When I publish [the post](https://justyy.com/archives/5758), the photo is still cropped (so it is not a display issue in the editor).

I have to re-edit the post in steemit.com and re-upload the image using steemit editor, so here is the correct photo URL (by steemit):

```

and here is the version from busy.org
