###  Cryptocurrency Lookup
- What is the project about?
The Cryptocurrency Lookup is a lightweight [Chrome Bookmark](https://helloacm.com/the-chromebookmark-cryptocurrency-lookup-tool-in-javascript/) Tool that you can add to your bookmarket bar. Once launched, the tool will prompt a dialog that allows your to query the following conversion rates between [cryptocurrency/fiat pairs](https://helloacm.com/the-cointools-update-alt-q-inline-cryptocurrency-query/).

1. `BTC SBD` - to get the exchange rate between `BTC` and `SBD`
2. `2 BTC LTC` - to see how many `LTC` can we get out of 2 `BTC`
3. `LTC 6 BTC` - to see how many `LTC` are equal to 6 `BTC`
4. the above pairs can also be fiats e.g. `USD EUR`

The exchange rate is from cryptocompare.com
