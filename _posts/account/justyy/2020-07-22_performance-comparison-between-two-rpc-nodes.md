I have compared the RPC node performance between api.justyy.com (Germany) and api.steemyy.com (Japan) for visitors coming from China

![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNWYoXrCbNn82XjFcczRyYQWybb6UWeoew8skqYAwqoCr/image.png)

As we can see, the German RPC node are quite slow (orange) and the Japanese RPC node is a bit faster (green) for most parts of China, especially the eastern coast.

Compared to api.steemit.com the official node, these two nodes provide a good alternative.

Every little helps! I hope this helps!
