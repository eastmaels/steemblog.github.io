# Coinmarketcap API
Just notice that: 
> WARNING: This API is now deprecated and will be taken offline soon.  Please switch to the new CoinMarketCap API to avoid interruptions in service. (https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/migrate/)

this means that I've to spend some time migrating the API and in the future, the personal free subscription may not be enough :(
