Unfortunately I was informed by the VPS provider that my VPS will be taken offline for a shortwhile at  10th July at 07:30 UTC+2.

> With this e-mail, we would like to inform you that there is an immediate need for a short maintenance for your VPS XL SSD (no setup). Our technicians will do everything in their power to finish all tasks as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, there was no way to announce this maintenance earlier, which is why we apologize for any inconvenience.  

> The maintenance will take place on Wednesday, 10th July at 07:30 UTC+2 in a time window of 60 minutes.

> The offtime of your VPS is expected to last no longer than 15 to 30 minutes.

As the VPS will be rebooted during the maintenance, the actual downtime will be a bit longer considering the replay.

However, I have started **another backup now** and hopefully it will be able to be back online soon.

The estimated replay time will be from 36 to 48 hours.
