This is a chrome extension to help download videos from some video sites.
As Google does not allow Youtube download in the extension, I have to cut down lots of features in the original plugin. So here is the simplified version (mini) that supports some common video sites.

This chrome extension is also bilingual.

This plugin is currently pending review and should appear in Google Webstore soon.

Clone the project, open your Chrome, type in *chrome://extesions* and load unpacked extensions, choose the folder.
