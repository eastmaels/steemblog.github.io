@onepercentbetter contacted me and said he can't get the [Steem Wallet](https://steemyy.com/wallet/) to work and it throws the following error message:

> VM371:53 {code: -32003, message: "Assert Exception:decimals == 3: Incorrect decimal places", data: {â€¦}, digest:

From the error message, it appears that the amount of SBD/STEEM he entered in the textbox is not exactly 3 decimal places and that is why the `steem.broadcast.transfer` complains and fails to transfer as requested.

The Fix is rather straightward, just putting a `.toFixed(3)` to the amount and the tool is good again. You will also notice the `err.Message` is shown in the message box as well as in the console via `console.log`.

> Please note that the SP you enter is the final amount to delegate. For example, if you already delegate 10 SP and you want to delegate another 5 SP, you will need to enter 15 SP (instead of 5 SP) in the delegation form.
