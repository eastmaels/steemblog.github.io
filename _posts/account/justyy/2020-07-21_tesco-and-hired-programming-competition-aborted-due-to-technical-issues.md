Today, at BST 5:00PM, the first programming contest (virtual) is scheduled. This event is sponsored by Tesco and organised by [Hired](https://helloacm.com/out/hired).

There were around 180+ participants on the zoom meeting. But unfortunately, the hired website kinda got DDos when 'so many' concurrent users are trying to log in.

After 10 minutes, the organised annouced that the event unfortunately has to be aborted. Good thing to know is that it is not totally cancelled. It will be changed to offline coding contest: given 2 coding tasks, finish within 24 hours instead of 1 hour online. Code will be graded and the winner will be getting 1000 TESCO gift card!

Good luck and have fun!
