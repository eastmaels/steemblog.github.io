I often need to test a few [steemjs](https://github.com/steemit/steem-js) code quickly, and it usually requires to include the `steem.min.js` library in your environment e.g. HTML. 

In [SteemTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/steem-tools/emjfpeecopppojbhkigjjmcahbfahhbn) there is a tab *Steem-Js* that alllows you to run a  piece of short SteemJs code. However, the code editor is just a simple textarea and users need to install the Chrome extension. Moreover, the editor size is small and the page cannot stay in the background i.e. everytime you click the Chrome Extension, it is a fresh page load.

Why not make it a [web page](https://helloacm.com/the-steemjs-editor-test-your-steemjs-code-snippet-easily/) that you can simply save as locally if you will.

The `log()` can be used to print to the page console. You can also press F12 for your browser console via `console.log()` etc.

That is it, very straightforward testbed for your SteemJs code.
