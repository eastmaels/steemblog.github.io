Hello,
I decide to write a simple steem block explorer. And viewing the transactions in a block is the first step.

# Known Issues
1. Latest blocks are showing 0 transactions, please refresh in a few minutes (I am looking into solving this issue, any help would be appreciated). The Last Irreversible blocks are fine.
2. customizing known operations - I will gradually improve it.
3. showing account's history page
4. search field, filtering

<hr/>

Every little helps! I hope this helps!


**Steem On!~**
