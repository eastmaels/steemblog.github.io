Recently I have observed a slightly increase of CPU usage on one of my API server, which is used to host [Steem Tools/APIs](https://helloacm.com/tools/steemit) and other stuffs e.g. [Blog](https://helloacm.com/), [online video downloader](https://weibomiaopai.com/download-video-parser.php), and other [online tools](https://helloacm.com/tools) etc. I have also identified those increase traffic are kinda legit - yes the page views is getting bigger and bigger.

Therefore, I decided to upgrade the server (located at New Jersey, USA) to four cores (from 2 cores), which will cost 48 USD per month (price also doubles).

After instant upgrade (I use [**Vultr VPS - $10 Free Credit**](https://helloacm.com/out/vultr) and the upgrade process is so easy the entire server is back online with new specs in less than 10 seconds), the load average is dropped.

The disk space doubles to 100G.

This hardware upgrade allows to serve better the [Steem Tools and APIs](https://helloacm.com/tools/steemit)!
