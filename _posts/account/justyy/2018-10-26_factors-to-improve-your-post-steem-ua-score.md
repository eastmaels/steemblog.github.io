At [this post](https://steemit.com/witness-category/@justyy/big-news-pumpkin-has-updated-his-votes), my post is ranked at #1 among 236 contributions in the steem-ua Algorithmic Curation Round.

So I think, this is mainly due to the fact that some steemians with higher steem-ua scores (the big whales) either vote or comment on the  posts.

So what do I get? @steem-ua votes the post with 3.79% weight and it was approximately $0.61 - not bad compared to the historic votes:
1. Rank 192 out of 244, weighting 1.44% approximately $0.21
2. Rank 225 out of 405, weighting 1% approximately $0.15
3. Rank 112 out of 270, weighting 2.02% approximately $0.31
4. Rank 62 out of 299, weighting 2.07% approximately $0.32
5. Rank 72 out of 260, weighting 2.25% approximately $0.35

Well, the voting weight definitely not linear with the post ranking...

BTW: I delegated 250SP to @steem-ua.

**Enjoy and Steem On!**


## Delegate to @justyy
@justyy runs a automatic delegation service for nearly a year now. Delegate to @justyy for at least 5 SP and start receiving daily payout as interests (from 8% to 10% APR). Also, as a supporter, the delegators will start to receive complimentary/curation upvotes (as a thank you) per day from e.g @justyy and a few other curation trails. For more information, [read this](https://github.com/DoctorLai/steemit-wechat-group). The voting weight algorithm is [open source](https://steemit.com/busy/@justyy/bank-of-china-implements-a-new-voting-algorithm).

- Delegate to @justyy - [at least 5 SP to join (automatically)](https://steemyy.com/sp-delegate-form/?delegatee=justyy)
- [Undelegate to @justyy (Quit) - SP returned by steem blockchain in 5 days](https://steemyy.com/sp-delegate-form/?delegatee=justyy&amount=0)
- [View Current Delegators/Supporters](https://steemyy.com/delegators/?id=justyy)

> Please note that the SP you enter is the final amount to delegate. For example, if you already delegate 10 SP and you want to delegate another 5 SP, you will need to enter 15 SP (instead of 5 SP) in the delegation form.
