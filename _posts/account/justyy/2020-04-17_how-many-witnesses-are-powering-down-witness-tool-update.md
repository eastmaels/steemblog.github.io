Are you powering-down as a witness? If yes, what are you planning to do with it?

I have added this information in the witness ranking table.

Please note: the powering down for witnesses are updated hourly and may not reflect the latest powerdown status.

You can **hover on the powering down figures** (which is the total number of STEEMs to power down over 13 weeks). Then it will lead to a detail powering down page with more information.

For example,

If the majority are Powering down, it may be a signal. But we shouldn't criticise witnesses if they are powering-down, afterall, it is their STEEMs and they can do whatever they want.

Possible powerdown reasons:
1. to keep some liquid steems (for investment purposes)
2. to pay for the witnesses servers and other costs.

This tool, as usual, is also available in Chinese: https://steemyy.com/witness-ranking-table/

I hope this helps!

**Steem On!~**
