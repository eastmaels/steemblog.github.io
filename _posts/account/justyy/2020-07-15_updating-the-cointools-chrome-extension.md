CoinTool is a Chrome Extension that I developed long time ago, which can be installed at:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coin-tools/fmglcggbdcbkpkfapngjobfeakehpcgj

However, I have not  updated for ages, and since the coinmarketcap is no longer working (requires paid subscription), I have decided to make some changes to at lease replace the coin price lookup with coingecko

Merging this PR, and the update has been pushed to the Chrome Webstore.
https://github.com/DoctorLai/CoinTools/pull/21/files

However, some features are still not working, for now, I don't have much time - and contributions are welcome!
