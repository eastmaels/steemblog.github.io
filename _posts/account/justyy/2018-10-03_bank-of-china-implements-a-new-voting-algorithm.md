As you probably know, the @justyy runs a delegated service where delegatees got a generous daily interests 8% to 10% no matter what happens. Apart from that, @justyy and its trails have voted the delegatees posts as a way to say thank you (not compulsory but I think it is a nice gesture.). The daily VP 20% is not enough :( and the bank reserves a portion of VP to curate manually.

## New Voting Algorithm
The source code of the voting percentage is [here](https://github.com/DoctorLai/steemit-wechat-group/blob/master/bank_getvp.py)

## Why update?
1. Open Source - Provides transparency
2. Filter out spam posts - e.g. contain 1 picture - length minimal 200 and filter out tags like `test`, `cn-shui` and `nsfw`
3. Encourage activities - e.g. bonus tags `cn-activity`
4. Encourage more delegation (support)
5. Higher reputation users are rewarded better
6. You scratch my backs (@justyy and @dailychina) - I scratch yours (voting-back bonus)
7. Witness support thank you.
8. Being a wechat member [here](https://github.com/DoctorLai/steemit-wechat-group/blob/master/members.txt)

## Existing rules
1. Delegation at least 350 SP to have 2 daily votes maximum.
2. Delegation at least 600 SP to have 3 daily votes maximum.

## It will be implemented within 12 hours.
And the Bank-Of-China reserves the right to ban/punish certain users for publishing spam posts. Report to report@steemyy.com

## Examples
Dynamically adjusted - values will vary slightly.
