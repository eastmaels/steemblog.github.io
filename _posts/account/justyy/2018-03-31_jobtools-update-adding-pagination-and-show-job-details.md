# Job Seeking using JobTools
### What is the project about?
[JobTools](https://helloacm.com/jobtools-update-adding-pagination-and-show-job-details/) is the first Job Seeking Chrome Extension that is based on [ZipRecruiter API](https://helloacm.com/php-job-searching-using-zip-recruiter-api/).  I have previously implemented a PHP Wrapper API for [job searching](https://github.com/DoctorLai/ZipRecruiter) and it is integrated in the [online tool](https://helloacm.com/software-engineering-jobs/) but I think  Chrome Extension is a perfect application entry point that users can easily access.

## Previous Contributions:
- [JobTools v0.0.1](https://helloacm.com/the-first-job-seeking-chrome-extension-based-on-ziprecruiter-api/): The First Job Seeking Chrome Extension based on ZipRecruiter API

## Version 0.0.2
[This Commit](https://github.com/DoctorLai/JobTools/commit/01ad148f712fcb4c5c60308648df7c2855cc6866) has the following changes:
1. Adding Job Search Pagination
2. Fixing table to show Job Details e.g. location, job title

### Technology Stack
Any applications that can be written in [Javascript](https://helloacm.com/the-weird-thing-about-javascript-part-i/) will eventually be re-written in Javascript. Chrome Extension is an ideal place to host your Javascript applications.

### Roadmap
- FilterJobsBySalaryRange
- FilterJobsByIndustry
- Integrated with Google Maps
- Add Jobs to Favorite
