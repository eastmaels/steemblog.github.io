My backup node was replaying from 0.20.3 and guess what, there is a new version 0.20.5 today. Luckily, it doesn't actually require a replay. Wow - First time jumping two versions! from 0.20.3 to 0.20.5!

> 1. To fix these known issues for most accounts, witnesses should upgrade immediately without replaying. 
> 2. Witnesses should replay the blockchain to retroactively fix RC of all affected accounts.

So, I will do a full replay on my main server but at the meantime the backup server is online producing blocks using version 0.20.5!

## What have we learned?
Too many versions bumping out in short time usually means that the QA process needs to be improved!  I seriously don't want 0.20.6 tomorrow.
