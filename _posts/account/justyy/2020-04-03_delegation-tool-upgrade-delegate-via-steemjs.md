Previously, the SP Delegation Tool I developed is only a simple tool that collects data in a simple form and redirects to SteemConnect.

My friends told me that the SteemConnect is blocked in China, some others told me that the SteemConnect is not user-friendly with too many buttons flowing between pages.

Thus, I have provided another way to delegate - via SteemJS.

**Tool: https://steemyy.com/sp-delegate-form/**
**Also available in Chinese: https://steemyy.com/delegate-form/**

Basically, The Core SteemJs code to broadcast a delegation is:

```
steem.broadcast.delegateVestingShares(ActiveKey, delegator, delegatee, amount + " VESTS", function(err, result) {
  if (err) {
      log(err);        
  } else {
      log("Successful!", result);
  }
}); 
```

## How to use?
1. Enter Delegator ID (Who you are)
2. Enter Delegatee ID (Who you want to delegate SP/Vests to?)
3. Amount (0 to undelegate)
4. Unit (SP or VESTS): if entered SP, it will automatically be converted to VESTS
5. Active Key (safe to use it in your browser)
6. Click the Button
7. Wait for the confirmed message.

I hope this helps!
