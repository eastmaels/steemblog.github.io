The Discord Bot `steemit` is my first written discord bot. And recently I have received the message from Discord official.

I am also in the process of verifiying the bot as it is installed more than 100 channels.

Unfortnately, due to terminating the SteemSQL service, some commands are not working, thus I need a bit of time to rewrite it.

Fixed the suggestion command due to coinmarketcap API broken for a while:
