# @justyy's Witness Nodes have been smoothly upgraded to 0.20.8 without any downtime - via the docker command `./run.sh install && ./run.sh restart`

Upagrading from 0.20.7 to 0.20.8 is optional but recommended as this update fixes a memory-leak problem. And most importantly, it does not require a replay (re-indexing takes ages, as every steem witness knows).
