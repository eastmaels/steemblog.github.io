I am doing a coding exercise, as usual.... And to [split a string](https://helloacm.com/leetcode-online-judge-does-not-support-boost-library-for-c-solutions/) in C++, the best/easy way is to use the boost library... However, this is not supported on leetcode online judge...

And, suddenly I am stuck and lost the passion for C++.

Ok, I will solve the problem using a more modern language, maybe C#..
