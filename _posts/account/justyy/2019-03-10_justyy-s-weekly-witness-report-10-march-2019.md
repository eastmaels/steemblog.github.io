# Weekly Witness Update 
As a witness, I feel it is useful to have a weekly report, which will be produced every weekend at the hashtag #witness-report

# Last Report
[@justyy's Weekly Witness Report - 3/March/2019](https://steemit.com/witness-category/@justyy/justyy-s-weekly-witness-report-3-march-2019)

# Witness Status
[My Witness Page](https://steemyy.com/witness-data/justyy)

# Witness Server
- Running 20.9 now (Docker)
- Location: Germany
- 10 cores of Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v4 @ 2.20GHz
- 60 GB RAM
- 1600 GB SSD
- 1300 Mbit/s port, Upstream 130 Gbits
- Ubuntu 18.04 bionic

## Block produced in last 7 days
70 blocks (=) produced in last 7 days and rewarded 156707.9030 VESTS in total (approximately 77.6550 (-1) Steem Power).

## Witness Summary
Rank 74(+1) - Total Votes: 11706Vs (around -200 MVs)  and 769 Voters (+3) . Total: Missed 28 Blocks. (0 - Miss this week). Feed published every 2 hours smoothly.

Backup Server is cancelled to save the cost in the current bear market and considering the current witness ranking position. 

## Delegation
@justyy is the 7-th most delegated ([306 Delegators](https://steemyy.com/delegators/?id=justyy)) project on steem blockchain (See below).

## Delegation Rewards
In last 7 days, 120.7820 SP were given out to the [306 delegators](https://steemyy.com/delegators/?id=justyy). Thank you!

The steem price is low and hence more delegations to @justyy as his delegation return APR% still stays the same.

## Revenue and Expenses
1. Monthly SteemSQL  cost: **20 SBD** roughly 50 STEEM at current price.
2. Monthly Costs for Two Witness Nodes: around 100 USD
3. Monthly API server costs: around 150 USD 
4. Monthly Domain Costs: 5 USD
And not to mention time and efforts spent on:  developing new tools, monitoring and upgrading the witness servers. It is profitable only (especially under such low STEEM price) if you are at Top 50, so please do support me by [voting me as a witness](https://steemconnect.com/sign/account_witness_vote?approve=1&witness=justyy) or [set as a witness proxy](https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/account-witness-proxy?proxy=justyy&approve=1). Thanks.

I like STEEM and I do believe the STEEM - that is why I have been spending money and efforts on being a witness and promoting STEEM community via developing tools/applications, providing APIs, helping Utopian moderating work etc.

I am not giving up .. YET, and I will keep working hard to bring something unique to the community.

**Enjoy and Steem On!**

## Delegate to @justyy
@justyy runs a automatic delegation service for a long time. Delegate to @justyy for at least 5 SP and start receiving daily payout as interests (from 8% to 10% APR). Also, as a supporter, the delegators will start to receive complimentary/curation upvotes (as a thank you) per day from e.g @justyy and a few other curation trails. For more information, [read this](https://github.com/DoctorLai/steemit-wechat-group). The voting weight algorithm is [open source](https://steemit.com/busy/@justyy/bank-of-china-implements-a-new-voting-algorithm).

## 306 Delegators! Thank you!
*@justyy is the 7-th delegated project on steem blockchain*

> Please note that the SP you enter is the final amount to delegate. For example, if you already delegate 10 SP and you want to delegate another 5 SP, you will need to enter 15 SP (instead of 5 SP) in the delegation form.
