I often need to convert a piece of text e.g. URL to QR code, so I write one and make it Open Source.

# It runs Offline
It runs offline. So even you don't have a internet connection, you can still use this plugin because it is not calling any [external API](https://helloacm.com/how-to-generate-qr-image-using-google-api/) but requires the use of `qrcode.min.js` which is also known as a free JS library.

# Easy to use
You can click the extension icon and the QR image for the current tab URL will be shown. You can also select a piece of text and right click 'Get QR' so the QR is generated on the fly.

You can also double click the QR image to edit the text.

# Features of `Offline QR Code Generator/Editor`
- Absolutely Offline and Fast
- Context Menu Support (Any Selected Text to QR)
- Absolutely simple, powerful and Ads-Free
- Easy to use
- Allow QR Modification (Click the Image)

This Simple Chrome Extension (Clean UI with no Author or other links) allows you to get the QR image for the current Tab URL. You click the extension icon and then you will get the QR image.

You can right click to copy, open in new tab or save the image. This plugin requires No Internet Connection (via `qrcode.min.js`)

You can also select any text and click the 'Get QR' in the context menu. If no selection is found, the current tab URL will be converted to QR. The QR image will be shown in the same page and again, you can click the QR image to modify the text.

If you don't like context menu, you can hide it in the option page.

# Proof of work
