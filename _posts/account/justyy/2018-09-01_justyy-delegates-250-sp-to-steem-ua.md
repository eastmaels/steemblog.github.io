@justyy delegates 250 SP to @steem-ua to support this amazing project (UA, Steem User Authority: developed by @scipio and @holger80), as described in [this post](https://steemit.com/ua/@steem-ua/news-and-updates-on-steem-ua-and-ua-api).

# What I'd like to see steem-ua to have in the future
A easy to use web-tool that allows users to check any user's UA score without steemconnect. Currently only logged-in user can view the score and the top 100 users are listed in public (@justyy has listed 88 - YEAH)

A free API that allows any users/apps to fetch the UA score. Currently, only partners (as seen [here](https://steem-ua.com/api-documentation)) can access the API.  We can rate-limit the API or even have something like a paid subscription.

## Very good job!  @scipio and @holger80, Big congratulations!
