I have waited more than 3 days and decided to replay the blockchain. It is not a pleasant decision but I have observed that the program has repeatedly been throwing exceptions on a few blocks again and again (basically no progress, CPU taking 200% usage and memory around 45%)

I wanted *./run.sh restart* to work, but it failed:

I don't want to go back to v20.0.10 yet - which may be the last resort. So, I did a *./run.sh replay* and it seems the MIRA has speed-up a little bit at the begining - those MIRA indices migrating which took hours did help a little bit?

I am still around. Please continue supporting me... It is frustrating that replay requires hours, and that sometimes it just  dies with unknown reasons. But I am trying my best to bring it alive - just have a little faith on it!
