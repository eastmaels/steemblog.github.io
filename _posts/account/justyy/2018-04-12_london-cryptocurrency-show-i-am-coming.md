I live in a village around Cambridgeshire, UK. I don't usually travel, not to mention to the big city, LONDON!

However, I am going to London this Sat, because of.... **London CryptoCurrency Show**!

It is great that the steemians get the free entry via the following registration link (not sure if it is too late)
https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-london-cryptocurrency-show-tickets-42604069920?discount=Promo-Steem

My plan:  go to bed early at Friday night (tomorrow), wake up at 5:00 AM Sat, drive to Huntingdon, and take the one hour train to London St Pancras International, take the underground to Hammersmith and walk to the show! I hope I don't get lost :P

See you there!  @elear @utopian-io @wehmoen @exyle  @rea  @starkerz  and more...
