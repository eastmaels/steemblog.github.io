Two days ago, my witness node was [offline due to an upgrade](https://helloacm.com/steem-witness-updated-to-0-19-6-and-server-using-zram/). My steem-ua dropped a day after.

The score is not immediately restored but after a day or so e.g. I guess @steem-ua will take a moving window average for 3 days or so.

After my witness is back to top 60, my UA score is again in the top 100. Oh Yeah!
