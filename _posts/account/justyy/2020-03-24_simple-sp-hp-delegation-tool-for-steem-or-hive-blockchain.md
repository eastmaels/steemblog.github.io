I remember shortly after I joined STEEM, I made a simple tool to delegate the STEEM/vests as there is no easy way to do so on the Steem front-end.

Now after the split, we've got the HIVE delegation which is done via HiveSigner, thus I think it would make thing a little bit easier to integrate into a single tool.

The tools is also available  in Chinese for the CN community to use:

I hope this helps!
