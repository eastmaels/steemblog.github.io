Have you heard of the concept of "Compound Effect"?

Here is the definition
> “The Compound Effect is the principle of reaping huge rewards from a series of small, smart choices.” This idea behind The Compound Effect is that small consistent action over a long period of time has greater pay offs than intensely large but short changes.

A simple example is that if you take 30 minutes exercise everyday and stick to it no matter what happens, you will start losing weight gradually in a few months time. Rome is not built in a day. Don't expect to see the outcome the next day.

It is hard, but effective. As a human, we tend to find execuses to be lazy. Fewer people choose to be hard-working and be patient.

I have been practising coding (and solving more than 800 puzzles) on leetcode for more than a year now. I do it every day - no execuses - and I also post articles on how to solve them on [my blog](https://helloacm.com). As a result, I am always quick to code.

I also do the rope skipping (1000 times) per day for 3 months, and also the intermittent fasting i.e. strictly eating in a 8 hour window per day. And I have lost around 3kg so far.
