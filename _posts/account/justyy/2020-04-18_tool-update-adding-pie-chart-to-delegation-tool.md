I have added a Pie Chart to the following tools:

1. View Delegatees:  https://steemyy.com/delegatees/
2. View Delegators:  https://steemyy.com/delegators/

Example:

As usual: this update has also been applied to the **Chinese versions**:
1. View Delegatees:  https://steemyy.com/list-of-delegatees/
2. View Delegators:  https://steemyy.com/list-of-delegators/

The Charting library is based on ChartJs  https://chartjs.org

A pie chart let you see the percentage of the delegation easily e.g. who is your biggest supporter (by amount of SP delegated to you)

------------

I hope this helps!

**Steem On!~**
