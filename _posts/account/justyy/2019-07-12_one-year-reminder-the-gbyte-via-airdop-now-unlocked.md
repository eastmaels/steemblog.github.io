Do you still remember that a year ago, you probably got some free airdropped GBytes ? 50% were unlocked and you probably converted to BTC or other shitcoins but the other 50% remained locked for a year.

Good news, for me, those locked GBytes are unlocked and I have just exchanged them to Bitcoins!
