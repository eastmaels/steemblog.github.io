I have recently started to attend the online coding contest. Leetcode has held weekly contests on Sunday early mornings - which isn't ideal for coders living in Europe.

However, they have biweekly contests, which is run the Sat 3:30 to 5:30 (BST) every two weeks.

Today's contest: https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-30

I have managed to solve 3 puzzles in 30 minutes, however, failed to solve the fourth puzzle (difficulty level) in next hour. 

The programming language I choose is Python, C++. I have 1 Wrong Answer submission for Problem 3 - which adds total 10 minutes time penalization.

The fourth puzzle is not that difficult - it is a pity that I didn't get it - and my ranking is expected to drop.

## Reformat Date
https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-30/problems/reformat-date/
It is harder to use C++ as in C++ the [string split function](https://helloacm.com/how-to-split-a-string-in-c/) is not native. Python is good.

## Range Sum of Sorted Subarray Sums
https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-30/problems/range-sum-of-sorted-subarray-sums/
O(N^2) will work - as the input range is (10^3), however beware of the integer overflow.

## Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves
https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-30/problems/minimum-difference-between-largest-and-smallest-value-in-three-moves/
Sorting (O(N^LogN)) and then compare four different possibilities.

## Stone Game IV
https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-30/problems/stone-game-iv/
Dynamic Programming, similar to [this puzzle](https://helloacm.com/dynamic-programming-perfect-squares/)

I'll share the solutions on the [blog](https://helloacm.com) in more details soon.

Although the contest has ended, you can try to participate on the virtual contest.

Every little helps! I hope this helps!
