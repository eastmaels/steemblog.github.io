[Coinbase](https://helloacm.com/out/coinbase) is giving away $3 worth of ZCASH, which is a privacy-enabled cryptocurrency.

First, you need a [Coinbase](https://helloacm.com/out/coinbase) account - which you can register [here](https://helloacm.com/out/coinbase)

Then, you can use the following URL to start watching three videos about ZCASH
https://www.coinbase.com/earn/zcash?utm_medium=email&utm_source=invited&utm_campaign=zec_launch

After each video (1-2 minute each), there is a question, which should be fairly easy to answer, you will then receive ZCASH shortly.
