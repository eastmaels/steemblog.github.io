There's one thing about China that I just can't quite get used to yet. It's these rows and rows, fields and fields of bicycles and electric bicycles and scooters and tricycles everywhere. This hodgepodge of transportation vehicles has always been a hallmark of China. But in the past couple years, the hue of the debate has changed.

Now it's these branded rent-a-mobiles everywhere. Here's a field of 'em out in the northern suburbs of Shanghai:![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZ5pF9wnSPJPHEXTnxqNV4hAbvtgLQn6Cq41UUpWEWbDB/image.png)

These are the no-need-to-pedal 35-mile-per-hour commuter bikes for lazy people and people who maybe spend at least a couple of hours a day commuting on a freaking scooter. As we say in the South, "Bless their hearts!"

While we're talking about this particular little corner of my beloved city, can someone please tell me why they made this building out in the middle of nowhere and then put a bridge between two towers on the 20th floor?

This building is not a hospital or anything.

I checked.

It's some sort of factory (广场）... But why would it need an elevated walkway?
