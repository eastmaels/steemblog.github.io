Well, I hate to say "I told you so."

But, oh, nevermind...

I TOLD YOU SO.

Right here: https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@shanghaipreneur/undervalued-coin-watch-oyster-prl

The Oyster Protocol "could be" the solution to everything that plagues the internet. Or it could just be another failed project. Whatever happens on that front, PRL is most certainly an undervalued coin in the cryptocurrency space.

Take a look at this hourly blow-by-blow from February 8th through 11th:

At its peak, that was something like a 90% move in a day. This action is what small cap coins are all about. Now when you combine a small cap coin and news, actual real bullish-as-fuck news, not just some fluff come up with by the PR firm you hired, you get price movement backed by SIGNIFICANT VOLUME.

On my CMC screen, I'm looking at $6 million in trades executed in the past 24 hours.

That's A LOT for a small cap coin like PRL. So obviously the next question any "rational" investor should ask (and let's face it - does ANYONE know ANYBODY that is in fact "rational"? I'm still looking...) is

WHY?

Why did this little useless ERC-20 token spike in price so much in just one day? And why is Shanghaipreneur wasting his Sunday morning coffee to tell Steemit about it?

Fair points, for sure. I like coffee and mine is getting cold af from spending too much time writing this post.

Here are the 2 reasons that I have been able to discern so far.

1) COIN BURN

https://medium.com/oysterprotocol/oyster-pearl-team-update-4-f2cc22eca1a7

The coin burn is the new method for "little coins that could" to regenerate interest in people trading them. It is a logic based on the most basic of economic principles. When you decrease supply, assuming that demand stays constant, the price of an asset MUST correct upwards to reflect its new status as a more "rare" asset. But beware that caveat "if demand stays constant," which is not always guaranteed.

Lots of coins are doing this, or contemplating this, right now. Perhaps bot favorite Tron (TRX) is the most famous coin thinking about using this tactic. As a result, some crazy Youtubers are calling for TRX to go to $15.

That's nonsense.

To me, coin burns are all just semantics. Having too many coins is a sign that there is less demand for your coin than you thought there would be. And highlighting that fact does not seem to me to be the most prudent thing to do for your coin's value in the long run. But hey, coin burns are working, and we are in a market where anything is on the table. Whatever works... right?

But this coin burn announcement was on February 2 and the "moon" didn't happen until February 10, eight days later. But the crypto markets were in a freeze and it's understandable that "risk-on" trades like undervalued small caps might get swept under the rug until the next market upturn. So I'm willing to give this factor a 20% weight as to the reason for Oyster's huge move yesterday.

But the primary factor for yesterday's "moon" is...

2) AIRDROP!!!!

https://medium.com/oysterprotocol/dawn-of-a-new-era-3ca2e2f5a1c6

Airdrops are another new favorite strategy for coins in 2018. This post by the anonymous leader of Oyster, Bruno Block, had the most to do with yesterday's huge move upwards. Titled "Dawn of a New Era," it's short and to the point.

He concisely and precisely points the reader to where he is trying to pilot this project:

"Oyster is a revolutionary protocol that resets the assumptions of the current internet paradigm and addresses the aforementioned issues [the internet being constantly threatened by governing bodies worldwide concerning censorship, regulation, and spying a part of which has resulted in the net neutrality fiasco in the US] with a new comprehensive platform."

That's a mouthful.

And whether or not Block can pull it off is yet to be seen. But at least now we know why he/she has kept himself anonymous up to this point in the development of the project. Previously, the naysayers have used the project leader's anonymity to deride the project. But read that quote above and start counting how many mega-cap companies, and of course the politicians that they lobby, that will be disrupted with this technology. Just off the top of my head... Verizon, AT&T, Comcast, Netflix, Google, Facebook... That's trillions of dollars at stake here with this potential technology. So hopefully you understand Block's caution a little better. Plus, Satoshi's anonymity hasn't stopped Bitcoin from being worth a hundred billion dollars so I struggle to understand the critique.

We are talking about one of the most fascinating, and achievable, use cases for cryptocurrencies - the equitable and sustainable monetization of media.

Now, how is Block going to achieve this disruption?

Well, with yet another coin, of course.

Oyster (PRL) will soon airdrop to all PRL holders (or HODLers as is the current industry jargon) a new coin appropriately called Shell (SHL). The reason for this split is not entirely clear to me, but it has something to do with fairly compensating content creators (the ones that actually make the media) and media distribution arms (the ones that pay for the infrastructure to deliver the media). Here's what Block has to say about Shells:

"Today I am introducing Oyster Shell (SHL). Shells are used to pay for connectivity and Dapp operation across the Oyster meshnet, whilst Pearls are used for static data retention on the tangle. Shell is not pegged to storage like how Pearl is. In the future you will be able to use Shells to access the decentralized web, connectivity that entirely bypasses ISPs and centralized infrastructure."

Seriously, that's revolutionary!

At a current market cap of just about $70 million (as of writing), Oyster (PRL) is still on my Undervalued Coin Watch List. On the list of altcoins liable to make the leap to $1 billion market cap, Bruno Block and his team are pretty far up there. If that happened, we'd be talking about a 14x move from here.

Block has said as much in his previous Medium posts. Work through the calculations in this post,
https://medium.com/oysterprotocol/how-prl-pricing-will-work-in-the-future-d67c4f231386

And you will find that Block thinks the PRL coin should eventually be worth $15, which is about 14x from here.

Great minds think alike?

--------

Anyways, please note this is not financial advice and I'm totally biased because I own some of this coin and my daughter's name is Pearl. So I mean, DYOR but feel free to follow me or ask any questions below. I'm sure I'll be talking about Oyster Protocol soon enough.
