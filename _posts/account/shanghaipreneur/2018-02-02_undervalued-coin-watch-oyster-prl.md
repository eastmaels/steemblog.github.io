With all the pessimism and let's call it "Toyotaism" (as opposed to Lamboism) in the cryptoworld these days, I thought I might like to think positively for a bit this morning. If I am trying to think like Warren Buffett, I might console myself with the old Rothschild quote to only "buy when there's blood in the streets."

Buffett, however, in his old folksy way toned that down a bit. His famous quote for days like today is be  “fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”

No mention of blood at all.

Oh well.

So how we might be able to think like Buffett in the crypto markets?

The goal is to look around for the fallen angels of a month ago and see where there might be some bargains lying about. Today I want to highlight one of these "pearls" of the cryptoverse and talk about Oyster (PRL) token.

It goes without saying that I am obviously not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice and don't listen to me because I only looked up this coin initially because my daughter's name is Pearl and then I read the whitepaper and I thought it was kinda neat and you should always invest your own money while considering your own unique circumstances etc. I have a very little amount of money in this investment so you shouldn't listen to me anyway. This is not financial advice. Investments carry risk. At the very least, please just go and skim the whitepaper!

Okay. Done.

Oyster (PRL), formerly Oyster Pearl, is an interesting project that melds together a rather elegant solution for two of the more interesting and achievable early crypto use cases.

The first crypto use case involves decentralized storage. Other projects in this space that you might know are Sic (SC), Filecoin (FIL), and Storj (STORJ). With the exponential growth in data and also the growth of the companies that generate, manage, analyze, and interpret our data - the FAANG/BAT internet "barons" of the modern era - ways to decentralize and reduce the cost burden of data for megacap companies, not to mention just regular everyday Joes like me, are going to be the foundation of a few quite valuable companies. For comparison, Dropbox and Box are the centralized competitors in this space. Dropbox is currently estimated to be worth about $10 billion. Box trades on the stock market as BOX. It is currently valued at around $3 billion.

The second crypto use case for PRL involves disrupting the entire media monetization industry. The debate goes back at least as far as media has been a thing. There is a constant battle between content creator and content distributor. In this traditional scenario, the centralizing force in the economy is the distributor. In the blues era, artists literally sold their rights for a song. They would get paid for the performance, but the capitalist behind the recording desk would own the rights to that song and the recording. Later, agents would come along to "save" the artists. But that's just a less-powerful centralizing force (the agents) doing battle with a more powerful centralizing force (the labels). With the digitization of music, the industry became more decentralized. But we still have the Apple Music Store, so there is still quite a bit of power left in this system to the distributor at the expense of the creator.

But that is all about to change. The rising costs of live sports media to wholesale entertainment distributors like Disney shows the potential for what happens wise up to the value of the content they create.

They get paid. When the NBA renegotiated its media rights deals with Turner, ESPN, Tencent and others, value of the teams skyrocketed! The Houston Rockets, whose best player is set to start a $50 million a year contract, were not coincidentally just sold for more than $2.2 BILLION.

Media is by its very nature traditionally a highly centralized industry. They make money by being the gateway through which you consume your media. But they don't make any media. Not really. The content creators (the artists) themselves do.

Previously, independent content creators were not powerful enough to confront entrench centralized media forces. But with technology like the Oyster Protocol, they have a fighting chance to have their, at first, tiny voice heard and get compensated fairly by those that hear it and appreciate it.

Other projects on the more ambitious, and rather broad, side of this space are the Basic Attention Token (BAT), Kin (KIN), and our beloved STEEM. I'm sure there are others.

More specific to the advertising media industry, where projects are essentially trying to "blockchain-ify" the existing agent business model, are AdEx (ADX) and Chinapex (CPX).

A couple of blockchain projects that disrupt the media monetization industry are gonna be ridiculously valuable. And, hey! It maybe could end up being Oyster (PRL).

So what got my attention from a chart perspective in the past day of "blood in the street" crypto pricing? Well, check out my highly advanced technical analysis below!

From 7,516 to 14,078 satoshis in BTC is a really serious high-volume move in a way-way-down market. When the entire global market cap for cryptos starts to creep back up, this pearl of the cryptoverse could generate a little alpha for risk-tolerant crypto investors.

What do you think about Oyster (PRL) as a potential cryptoasset investment?
