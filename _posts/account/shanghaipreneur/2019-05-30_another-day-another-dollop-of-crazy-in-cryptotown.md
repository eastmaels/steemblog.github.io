My last post on [the 3 D's of Crypto](https://steemit.com/crypto/@shanghaipreneur/on-decentralization-dialectics-and-the-distribution-of-token-supply) went a little deep, so I thought I'd throw a little basic reportage into the feed here.

In the past 24 hours a fork of a fork of bitcoin, led by a man who has been widely discredited as the originator of the bitcoin code but still enjoys clinging on to the idea that he is The Real Satoshi, has more than doubled in price. The reason for the rise is, seemingly, because of  a similarly widely discredited rumor.

Or as the current US president would probably say: [FAKE NEWS!!!](https://todaysgazette.com/fake-chinese-news-on-binance-craig-wright-pumps-bitcoin-sv-bsv-by-50/)

![trump-press-fake-news.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbaVfMVD2MgGVDTemHsm6GdPjF2shDcffXB5gUaphAJA4/trump-press-fake-news.jpg)

And yet, you know what they say... money talks... and bullshit walks.

Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision (BSV or BCHSV, if you are a crypto trader) was reported to have reached a deal with Changpeng Zhao (CZ) of Binance to be re-listed. The coin had been previously de-listed in response to some threats that Faketoshi (which the BSV founder is often called by his very vocal critics) made toward an online feline.

No, I'm not making this up: Faketoshi v. Fakecat. The kitty is so afraid that it has not yet turned back up on the Twittersphere.

And that somehow led to CZ & Crew getting angry enough to cost this guy some money.

That disagreement had reportedly (at least according to the very reputable Chinese news outlet Coin Double Bull ü§î- again, I'm not kidding, you can check out Â∏ÅÁâõÁâõ [here](http://www.jinsenw.com/)) been smoothed over by a 50,000 BTC transfer (approx. value $400MM) from the genesis wallet by the Prof. BSV to CZ's company.

Nevermind the absurdity of all this... Like, why would anyone just send someone $400 million out of the blue and with no guarantee of resolution.

But China folks saw it in their very favorite WeChat groups, so it must be true!

Buy buy buy!

And so the blockchain world moves forward into what is shaping up to be one epic Summer Of Bitcoin.
