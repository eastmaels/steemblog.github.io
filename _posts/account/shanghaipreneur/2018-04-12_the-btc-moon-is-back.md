Well, the full moon technically came out on March 31, 2018 and the new moon is set to visit us on Sunday, April 15.

But that didn't stop bitcoin from making its own moon today on Thursday, April 12, 2018.

Nearly $100 million of volume occurred at around 6:30 p.m. Beijing time. How do I know this? Well, please just check out my very excellent technical analysis (TA) from my very own [Blockfolio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/7574371/):

See! TA is easy, @haejin!

Market order books all over the world went way way out of whack. I know because I had a big order in for ZEN at 0.06 ETH even... that's my new job - I'm a ZEN shill. Ever since they started talking about their new supernodes, and then they went and published this [awesome whitepaper](https://zencash.com/assets/files/Zen-Application-Platform-Whitepaper.pdf) about it, which is like 7 pages of pure crypto-revolution! But I digress...

I checked the order book after my class was over and noticed that my order at 0.06 ETH had finally filled, but but I also found out that

## some orders had been filled as low as 0.0426!!!

Obviously, that meant either ZEN crashed or ETH mooned... It was the latter.

As always, people try to explain why such a drastic unexpected move happens.

We of course had the Mt. Goxers out with the claim that [this transaction](https://blockchain.info/tx/9e813715fe9099f26ccda06c164f97cd46121e65d69b482222e7d2c3dd20fa91) was a move by legal counsel to sell their lode on Bittrex. Although how that portends a bullish move I don't know. (Seems bearish to me, but I guess we'll see in the next few days.)

We also have an interesting theory put forth by [this article](https://uk.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoin-surges-after-paper-says-cryptos-are-compliant-with-sharia-law-1123911) that publicizes a recent paper by Mufti Muhammad Abu Bakar, Sharia advisor and compliance officer at Blossom Finance, that claims that cryptocurrency is one of the few Western finance constructs that is compatible with the Sharia prohibition against fractional reserve banking.

I bet you can find another hundred theories as to why bitcoin, all of a sudden, after a long few days of rangebound trading, suddenly JUMPED out to a thousand-dollar increase in less than 30 minutes.

I know it's crazy.

It's totally like OMG WTF!

(Coincidentally, OmiseGo was also up 23% - more than Bitcoin's leap - as of this writing. The What The Fuck Coin is, to my knowledge, still not available. WTF fuh realz!)

But I think everyone ignores the most likely proposition.

It just happened for no reason at all.

The legendary mentor of Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham, is famous for saying, "In the short run the market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine."

The crypto markets today were a day for the weighing machines.
