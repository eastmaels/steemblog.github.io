Just a little quick update to mark what seems to be like yet another springtime crypto bull. Last year at this time, almost to the day, I remember coming back from teaching a finance class. I looked down at my phone on the way into the train station and bitcoin prices were hovering around $7000. By the time I got to the platform and was waiting for my train, I looked down at my phone again and

BAM! $7800.

A 10% rise out of literally nowhere.

That was April 12, 2018. At about 8pm or so China time (8am EST), if I remember correctly.

This year, the date and time of infamy for the “Whoa! Where did this random bitcoin pump come from?” will be

April 3, 2019. Sometime around 12:40 pm China time the market suddenly jumped from approximately $4200 to $5000 within an hour.

How do I know this so specifically?

Because it was me that caused it.

I mean, right? Just take a look at this [tweet](https://twitter.com/shanghaipreneur/status/1112935388094627840?s=21)
I made at exactly 12:30 pm on that date.
Hmmmm... could it have been some twitter sentiment bot misinterpreting this tweet as a new price target for BTC and then triggering a cascading wave of bullish buy signals, which then triggered a massive series of margin calls, which then led to FOMO across the world and the inauguration of a new cryptocurrency hysteria...

It couldn’t have been... or could it?

It’s the butterfly effect in full effect.

Crazier things have happened you know...
