Now that the World Cup is over, the piles of international gambling money can get back to doing what it was enjoying doing so much before this whirlwind tour of non-stop soccer/football/futbol action distracted most of us for the past month.

What's that you say?

China's infamous "hot money" has been obsessed with only one pursuit pretty much in the past year:

Investing in altcoins!

What a lot of people have overlooked is just how much Chinese capital is tied up in the World Cup.

The New York Times has been spilling a lot of pixels on this thesis lately. To wit:

* [China Won’t Play in This World Cup. It Still Hopes to Profit.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/magazine/china-wont-play-in-this-world-cup-it-still-hopes-to-profit.html) (May 30, 2018)

*  [China's World Cup One Day? It's Already Here](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/07/04/sports/soccer/04reuters-soccer-worldcup-fifa-china.html) (July 4, 2018)

* [Chinese World Cup Sponsorship Not About Filling Gaps: FIFA](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/07/08/sports/soccer/08reuters-soccer-worldcup-fifa-china.html) (July 8, 2018)

* [The World Cup Final’s Unconventional Start Time](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/sports/world-cup/world-cup-start-time.html) (July 13, 2018)

Some highlights of this small cluster of articles:

Due to corruption scandals in Russia and within the organization itself, FIFA had trouble selling its ad inventory until a "real lifeline came from a cluster of Chinese companies willing to pay hundreds of millions of dollars and save the day." These companies included Wanda (cinemas and property development), Hisense (electronics), Vivo (smartphones), Mengniu (dairy products), and Yadea (electric scooters). Budweiser and McDonald's, two of the longest tenured FIFA partners, these brands are not!

Chinese tourists bought more tickets (40,000) to the games than even England supporters. Yes, those annoying guys who kept yelling "It's coming home" for 3 weeks to anyone who would listen. There were more Chinese in Russia for the Cup than them! There are even Chinese children acting as flag bearers. FIFA even shifted the start of the World Cup final match forward by a few hours to give the Chinese market a fighting chance to stay up and watch the world's largest televised event.

And watch we did! Lots of us.

Legitimate business interests are not the only providers of Chinese capital interested in the World Cup these days. On Friday the 13th of July, reports were published outlining a [$1.5 billion World Cup gambling ring based in China](https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2155118/chinese-police-break-us15-billion-cryptocurrency-world-cup-gambling-ring) that was using cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin specifically, to manage its books. Assuredly, that bust is just the tip of the iceberg, for [Chinese culture is obsessed with gambling and get-rich-quick schemes](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6423969545190498304) in general.

Just how much money left the cryptosphere for the fun times of World Cup prop bets and all-night drinking binges is, of course, impossible to tell. But data points like the $1.5 billion above give us a glimpse.

Another strikingly correlated statistic is the total crypto market cap leading up to the start of the World Cup on June 14, 2018. Here is the data from Coinmarketcap from June 1 to today:

![Screen Shot 2018-07-16 at 8.35.27 PM.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmeAHvMRkqeda6fNaznaSxYRW7Edyfhr8KC7AWSJ8ErKs3/Screen%20Shot%202018-07-16%20at%208.35.27%20PM.png)

Notice the decline from around $350 billion on June 10 to around $265 billion on June 14, the day of that most embarrassing opening game where Russia destroyed Saudi Arabia, 5-0. To me, that's a clear consequence of betting capital (i.e. "hot money") being moved from cryptocurrency exchanges to betting platforms both licit and illicit.

Today's action only confirms my hypothesis. The entire cryptosphere is up about 4.7% since Kylian Mbappé's historical goal less than 24 hours ago.

Time will only tell if this trend will continue. But I'll go out on a limb and say I'm confident that it will.

Why?

To put it simply, Chinese mining pools [control about 70%](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/china/) of the Bitcoin blockchain hashing power. Moreover, I've heard it said that just a little less than half of the capital that has entered the cryptomarket in the past 18 months has been from China. Plus, signalling from the widely recognized government mouthpiece *Global Times* indicates that bitcoin will soon get a reprieve from the Chinese government. An article titled [Improved regulation makes more sense than just saying no to bitcoin in China](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1104753.shtml) was published just 2 weeks before the Cup. Lastly, if we're truly headed into a Trump-induced trade war, and it looks like we are, bitcoin and its revolutionary ability to displace the US Dollar as an international reserve currency, just may be China's real "trump card" if it wants to stay afloat in a battle of attrition.

Putting all these bits and pieces together leads me to one important overriding conclusion that we can takeaway from the first truly Chinese World Cup ever. And that is:
