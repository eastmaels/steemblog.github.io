Zion Williamson and I are from the same state. If you don't know who he is, check out this [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEJb8Iyv4n8). To put it simply, he is going to be a star in the NBA.

A megastar.

He is 6 feet 8 inches or so tall, 280 pounds depending on how much he has recently eaten at the Blue Devil Tower.

You aren't *that* big and, at the same time, *that* athletic without working towards *that* goal for quite a while, which is why I wanted to highlight what Zion has posted on the top of his Twitter even today.

Zion Williamson [declared for Duke on January 20, 2018](https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2018/01/20/zion-williamson-commits-duke-2018-recruiting) but he pinned this Tweet on the top of his Twitter account more than 18 months prior to that.

And it is still posted there today.

Even though, as the 44th president of the United States, Barack Obama, pointed out the other night when Zion's standard-issue (for all Duke players) Nike's exploded causing a potentially college career-ending injury on literally the first play of the game against uber-rival the University of North Carolina Tar Heels,

## "His shoe broke!"

I'm sure this setback will be just another hurdle to climb in what I hope will be a long and illustrious career for the Iron Lion Zion. He certainly has the right mentality to overcome anything set in his path. Long-term goal setting and a consistent work ethic are hallmarks of success. Zion's pinned tweet proves it.

So I think this

won't stop Zion Williamson from cashing in on all of his hard work as the consensus first pick in the 2019 NBA Draft.

We all may not be world talent level athletes but we can certainly learn a few things from the Iron Lion Zion. Namely,

- Be yourself.

- Believe in yourself.

- Inspire yourself.

Nothing else matters.
