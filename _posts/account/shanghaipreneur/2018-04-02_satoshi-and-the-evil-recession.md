Despite our best efforts, it seems to me like we are all still living in the shadow of September 15, 2008. For those of you who forgot, were too young to care, or just plain don’t want to remember, here’s a little reminder:

The accumulation of financial damages rang out throughout the land. The collective consciousness of America grieved at its paper losses. But people did what they always do to keep on truckin’ —  they ate, drank, and farted away —and let  their lizard brain take over.
 
But those of us who remember, we knew somehow that the game was rigged. That this one class of people was chosen to be exercise some sort of "Get Out of Jail Free" card and this other class of people were not. It was odd to see it all laid plainly before our eyes. It wasn't like it was anything new. I mean the median income of all Americans hasn't budged in 20 years.

But to see the absurd ribaldry of bailing out the Too Big To Fail (TBTF) banks (and thus all of the people who worked at them - thereby rewarding the very same citizens that had had the most to do with the financial collapse in the first place) was just too much.

Politicians just call people lazy and leave them to rot. But a society is just not set up correctly when its [Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) is over 40, which is what the [World Bank reports today](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI?locations=US-CN-NL-ID-GB). A Gini coefficient of 50 is considered to be an absurdly high indicator of income inequality. Such a situation demands economic reforms.

Satoshi Nakomoto apparently was a strong believer in the critique of the TBTF system. After all, more than a few of us still drop to our knees today screaming, "How could you?" before getting up, dusting ourselves off, and moving on with our day. But he did something about it.

He published [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) in October 2008 and he released the first bitcoin software in January 2009. The very bottom of the market came two months later on [March 9, 2009](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/year-ago-today-dow-hit-bottom-recession/story?id=10046578), the Dow at a 12-year low of 6,547.05.

Sometimes you don't choose a project. It chooses you. Really, that’s how it is.  It’s part of your everyday life forever. You have to live and breathe the stuff, be comfortable with it, remain humble and try to live out a relatively comfortable kind of life. The great project that you spent a couple months on just because it came to you in a dream and you had to do it, shouldn't interfere with your right to a semi-private fulfilling life.

And so he... or she... or they... or it... is anonymous.

I'm fine with that.

I got into finance to find out what the hell went wrong back then in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Because to me it wasn’t a “panic,” as former Fed chief Ben Bernanke recently put it in a [Marketplace interview](https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace/bonus-bernanke-geithner-and-paulson-full-interview), it was a disaster. Because all I know is that whatever THAT was, that was not right. I've been trying to do something about THAT for years, but I don't know that I've come up with anything good about it, even though I'll be writing a dissertation about some of THAT in the near future.

Satoshi Nakomoto has already done something about THAT. And zhe did it all almost at the very nadir of the global market swoon. And for that we should all be grateful.

At least in the academic pursuit of finance, and I can't really speak from the perspective of the wider finance industry itself, at least in academics, we spend a lot of time trying to understand, prevent, and safeguard against the inevitable next economic crash. And we should.

That's what Satoshi was trying to do way back almost ten years ago.
