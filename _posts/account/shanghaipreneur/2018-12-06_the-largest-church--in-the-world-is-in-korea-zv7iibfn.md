I always knew that there were a lot of Christians in Korea, but I never expected this!

I‚Äôm on a business trip, arrived late one evening to my hotel room, then looked out the window in the morning and saw this lovely sight!

At first, I just thought the cross set against the backdrop of the mountainous skyline looked pretty cool, but then my colleague told me that this was the largest church in Seoul.

So, this morning of course I did a deep dive on the internet and found out that not only is this church the largest one in Seoul, but it has THE LARGEST CONGREGATION IN THE WORLD.

Yoido Full Gospel Church was founded in 1958, expanded quickly, and moved to its current location in ‚Äúthe Manhattan of Seoul‚Äù (Yoido Island) in 1973, long before the National Assembly and the Korea Stock Exchange set up in this area.

This church has dominated the world pentecostal scene since 1981 when the LA Times first recognized it as the largest congregation in the world.

Back then it had only 200,000 people.

Today it has around 800,000 people that attend its services.

The Guinness Book of World Records still
recognizes Yoido Full Gospel as having the largest congregation in the world. The sermons are translated into something like 17 languages and, of course, there are numerous satellite buildings around the 12,000-seat main hall that accommodate the overflow worshipers that are there for every service.

**Isn‚Äôt that crazy?**

This world is an amazing place. Sometimes you just need to pause and take a minute to look out your window.

Chances are you‚Äôll be surprised by what you see.
