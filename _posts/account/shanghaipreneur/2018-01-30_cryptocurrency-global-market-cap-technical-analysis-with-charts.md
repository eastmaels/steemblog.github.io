Call me an old fashioned stock investor but I sometimes gotta remind all my whippersnapper crypto guys to step back and take a bit of a look from the long-term perspective. Sure, crypto markets right now are "boring"... But that's actually great! More on that later... But come on, what's "boring" about a market where most investors are up 3x-4x in the manner of a couple of months?

There are some obvious and unavoidable calendar reasons for this recent "boring" crypto market. But let's take a look in this post at just the technical side of analyzing price movements.

Here we have a screenshot from our favorite CMC screen - the total market cap of the global crypto market. Not bad! We're almost triple from where we were 3 months ago. Yeah, we were at one brief point more than quadruple up in the past 3 months. But dems da breaks. It's like that.

But I'm really not worried. And I'll show you why in this next image:

Here we have a long-term support line for the global crypto markets. As long as we are bobbing along this line, with continually slightly higher lows at low volume, when trading volume does reappear on the crypto markets, most likely after the conclusion of Lunar New Year festivities in East Asia - coincidentally home to most of the world's crypto trading volume - we are likely to see a positive impact on the global crypto market cap
