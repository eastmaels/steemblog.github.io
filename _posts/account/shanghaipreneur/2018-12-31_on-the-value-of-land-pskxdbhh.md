**Land. They ain’t making any more of it, they say.**

Nevermind that they are. I’m pretty sure that Singapore and the Netherlands are about half sitting on man-made islands. Weird flat things I know where the water imperceptibly melts off into the land. You can barely tell whether you’re sitting on land or on water. The maps on your phone don’t know either. But, you know, that’s what they say.

**Give me land, give me land. If you really care for me, darling, you will give me territory, they say.**

That’s another land quote that is always floating around out there. I wish a woman would tell me to give her land. Gosh, I’d probably get married all over again if I ever heard this request. It’s just so. reasonable. I love it. But that’s actually what some people say when they say, “They say...”

**The land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts.**

Being that I am a Southern gentleman, I felt obliged to include this little nugget from *Gone With the Wind*’s Scarlet O’Hara. She was definitely a woman you wouldn’t mind giving some land to.

Land is a way of life in the American South and has been ever since some royal entrepreneurs came across the pond and started clearing forest and planting crops. They may have got a little lazy there for a bit, but I think at least regarding land they seem to have gotten that right.

This here picture is a little sliver of land available now near where I grew up.

Most people probably think that it would be somewhat cheap.

But you know what _they_ say,

# Land.

# They ain’t makin’ no more!
