There is a seismic shift coming to how blockchains achieve consensus. When Bitcoin was an experiment distributed on a few thousand battered old machines back in the shadow of the Great Recession, it made sense to incentivize people to contribute hashing power to the blockchain by allowing them to "mine" cryptocurrency in exchange for their hardware processing cycles. This process of reaching consensus on the blockchain is known as a Proof of Work (PoW) protocol.

But that was back when the processing power needed to maintain the Bitcoin blockchain was miniscule. Now the processing power being contributed to the Bitcoin blockchain, according to [BTC.com](https://btc.com/stats/diff) is beyond 25 Exa hash.

What's an Exa hash?

Beats me. In trying to figure out the answer myself, I came across this number

And this much handier description by [Standard Crypto](https://standardcrypto.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/what-does-one-exahash-look-like/) of what one exahash looks like:

> Today I am going to visualize an exahash. I’ll focus on the more more efficient 2.1 MW number for the new gear, as a small concession to sanity. In this scenario our office building has 28nm asics and is cranking out 10 PH. We need one hundred of our ten petahash office buildings. But these are no usual office buildings. [These are ones with huge] diesel backup generators.
>
> The Hoover Dam produces 2000 MW, so we could power 100 of our mega-mines if we had exclusive use of the power produced there.
>
> Or 10 747 jets at peak power.
>
> Or 10 nimitz class aircraft carriers at peak power.
>
> You could power all of Las Vegas with 7000 MW, or 3.5 Hoover Dams.
>
> So, our exahash looks like about one third of the Las Vegas skyline.

Now we have 25 Exa hash, or the equivalent of 7 glamour gambling cities like Las Vegas in all of its electricity-consumption glory, constantly crunching away on the Bitcoin #blockchain. In today's everexpanding hashrate and increasing difficulty environment, that number is set to expand exponentially.

The last time anyone cared about what an exahash is was way back in July 2017, a scant eight months ago in the real world but a lifetime in crypto. Back on Independence Day weekend, a [flurry](https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-hashrate-six-exahash-july-1/) of [articles](https://coinspectator.com/news/15428/the-bitcoin-networks-hashrate-now-exceeds-six-exahash) came out celebrating bitcoin surpassing the 6 Exahash mark.

That's a more than 4-fold increase in a little over 8 months!

Needless to say, powering seven Las Vegas's puts a heavy load on the global power generation and electricity distribution infrastructure.

And let's not forget that in most of the world we aren't talking about offshore wind farms and vast solar panel arrays, we're talking about this:

Now utilities are fighting back.

[Plattsburgh](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8xk4qv/bitcoin-ban-plattsburgh-coinmint-mining), a town in upstate New York, just banned all future crypto-mining operations due to one - [Coinmint LLC](https://www.coinmint.io/) - using up 10% of the town’s available cheap power. As #BTC increases in price, more people mine it, which leads to a difficulty adjustment in the mining software, which leads to an arms race of GPUs, ASICs and other techno-acronyms that then require ever more #energy.

It's a devastating feedback loop.

Every time the Bitcoin mining software ratchets up the difficulty, it inexorably centralizes the network, which essentially puts us right back in the privileged class system that the revolutionary aims of bitcoin were railing against.

Take a look at this chart from [BTC.com](https://btc.com/):

That purple swath in the middle is the fate of small Bitcoin miners. One year ago today, they contributed approximately one-third of the processing power to the Bitcoin blockchain. Today, in just twelve short months, that number has already dwindled to 11.06%. The other 89% of Bitcoin's hashing power comes from the 10 mines, mostly Chinese, listed in the graphic.

That's clearly not a decentralized system anymore and it's getting more centralized every month.

Therefore, the proof of work protocol for reaching blockchain consensus has proven difficult to scale efficiently, negative in terms of having an upward impact on the Gini coefficient of the overall Bitcoin network, and perhaps most importantly to the non-technologist non-economist layman...

IT IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN.

But this incredibly valid criticism of #cryptocurrency only applies to proof of work (PoW) coins like #Bitcoin, #Litecoin, #Ethereum, #Monero, & #Dash. Although #PoW coins will surely continue for the foreseeable future, their decline is inevitable. In fact, only 10 of the top 30 coins today are mineable coins.

The alternative to PoW is Proof of Stake (PoS). PoW coins will certainly continue for the foreseeable future, but their decline is inevitable. In fact, only ten of the top 30 coins today are mineable coins. So how do PoS coins incentivize people to contribute resources to the blockchain? In the proof of work protocol, it is easy to see that the carrot is newly minted coins that come with each confirmed and verified block of transactions.

But the incentive structures vary widely with PoS coins. With some, like NEO, you simply “stake” your assets into an online wallet or software wallet program. Some, like New Economy Movement (NEM), require you to open a software wallet and always leave a computer on. Still others, like ZenCash (ZEN), require the operation of a virtual private server (VPS). Additionally, PoS cryptoassets often require a sizable amount of the coin in order to enjoy comprehensive staking benefits. For instance, VeChain has a main token (VET) that generates 0.00042 Thor Power (VTHO) per day. However, tokenholders of 10,000 VET or more qualify to operate an Xnode, which qualifies for substantially higher staking rewards. Even larger hodlers of VET are entitled to even higher yielding rewards.

In contrast to PoW, where raw processing power is required to verify all those transactions and decrypt all those cryptographic puzzles, the various ways of “staking” your PoS coins on the blockchain prove that you have committed financial resources to the blockchain. With these “staked” #PoS coins, tokenholders regularly earn dividends.

It makes them happy. And more willing to invest for the long term.

Proof of Stake does not require 25 Exa Hash per second of global processing power and thank goodness for that.

The trees, and the governments who care about them, can breathe a sigh of relief. The inevitable growth of cryptoassets will not bring about an environmental apocalypse. The next generation of blockchains, the so-called third-generation blockchains, are almost all based on PoS. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin even introduced a paper in January 2018 titled [“Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget”](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09437.pdf) that outlined the future form of a hybrid PoW/PoS Ethereum blockchain.

So it looks like the future of #crypto will be good for your wallet.

And the birds and the trees, too.
