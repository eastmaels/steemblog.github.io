One of my old Chinese neighbors told me something today, *ku* *mu* *feng* *chun* or in Chinese characters, that's

## 枯木逢春 

I'm not necessarily all that into *chengyu* (as in I don't really know that many) but what I am into is the fact that literally a billion people understand the second and third layer of meaning you are trying to convey and you can do all that in just 4 simple characters.

This particular *chengyu* means that the “withered trees burst afresh in spring” and implies a person getting a new life. The *chengyu* first appeared in a legend where one of the Taoist eight immortals named Zhang Guolao, an 80-year-old cleric, married an 18 year-old daughter of Wei Shu. Lao Zhang certainly felt like a withered tree bursting on that wedding night!

So if this is indeed the crypto markets finding bottom, all of us who are still here have now certainly earned our "rings" on the inside of our withered old tree limbs.

We are all well-rooted ancient trees in which the first strong winds of spring stir the first green shoots of life.
