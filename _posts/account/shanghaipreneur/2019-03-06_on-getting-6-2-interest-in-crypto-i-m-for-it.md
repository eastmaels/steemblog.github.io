Pretty much the entire blockchain industry lit up today all atwitter about the ["highest yielding deposit account in finance"](https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/03/06/highest-yielding-deposit-account-in-finance-comes-from-crypto-blockfis-6-interest/) from [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/crypto-interest-account/). Even [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/03/05/crypto-challenger-bank-offers-bitcoin-interest-account-and-has-great-rates/#3d9118c13878) got in on the lovefest.

I can't tell you how many WeChat messages I got and tweets came through my feed today saying basically the same thing.

> "Did you see what BlockFi is doing with 6.2% interest? Love that."

> "Hey, did you hear you can get 6+% interest on your crypto in crypto?"

> "What is this about a bitcoin savings account? DAYUM."

Initially, I was like, "Meh, sounds good, I guess. I'll check it out in a bit." And then I did! And take a looky here:

That's a real, live website. I honestly think I'll be sending my Coinbase stash over to BlockFi this weekend.

Custody is by Gemini, the exchange started by those annoying twins portrayed in The Social Network. I'm sure they're not like that in real life.

But Gemini is a pretty stand-up name in the cryptosphere and backers of one of the better stablecoins out there - GUSD.

So it makes sense, right? Deep down, I'm just a blind HODLer, right?

I thought so, but then I read an old Chicago trader's post about the news where he trotted out the old "High yield means high risk" line... to which you would think most blockchain enthusiasts would scream back at him saying

DUH! IT'S CRYPTO!

To my surprise, however, everyone agreed with him. Social media is so weird like that.

So, here's what I say. Look, the yield is 6.2% APY in bitcoin or ethereum, not cash. So you’re still making a bet on cryptocurrency. This we know. Most people on Steemit or with enough BTC or ETH to consider locking it up for the long-term are not gonna bat an eye at the potential bone-crushing volatility in cash returns on these things. They just want to increase their STACKZ.

I like it. What’s the big deal?

I’ll give my kid 1 BTC in that account and forget about it.

By the time she goes to college, she’ll either have 2 BTC worth a bunch of USD, and I mean like maybe enough to pay for her whole collegiate adventure and still have some satoshis left over to go travelling a bit, or she'll have 2 BTC worth nothing.

Either way she'll have about 2x'ed her return in crypto terms with this BlockFi product.

Sounds like a “Heads I win. Tails I don’t lose too much” scenario to me.

Sign me up.
