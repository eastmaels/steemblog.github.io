I‚Äôm not a big BitcoinCash (BCH) fan.

But I don‚Äôt hate it either. Although a friend and I did perform a little experiment the other day...

We sent Litecoin (LTC) and BCH at the exact same time... and the BCH arrived 34 minutes after the LTC did... üò≠üò≠üò≠ so that has me feeling a little more bearish on Roger Ver‚Äôs shill project.

And of course it has more than doubled in the past ten days because, well, you know, crypto! Woo-hoo! It doesn't have to make any sense. It just has to MOON!

But maybe there is a reason for all this action besides the fact that Jolly Roger is swapping out his BTC for BCH by the millions. I‚Äôm not a Bitcoin Maximalist by any means. I mean, don‚Äôt get me wrong, Bitcoin is cool AF but third-generation blockchain networks like Aion, Wanchain, Cardano etc. are just capable of so much more...

## Like Twitter-esque social networks on the blockchain. ##

That‚Äôs why I was like, ‚ÄúLooky here!‚Äù when I read about [Memo.cash](https://memo.cash/), the most recent project on the BCH network. You can read about it [here](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@fycee/memo-cash-the-social-media-of-bitcoin-cash-bch) and [here](https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/04/15/bitcoin-cash-gets-twitter-like-social-network-running-blockchain), which is where I also got the trippy horse image.

It‚Äôs basically a primitive twitter Dapp, but with all your little musings and observations recorded for time immemorial on every BCH node that there is and ever will be.

Now whether or not that is actually a good thing is beside the point. The takeaway is that

## NOW WE CAN DO SHIT LIKE THIS ##
And it‚Äôs fucking amazing!
So let's get the fuck out there and

Like Jimmy O. Yang‚Äôs character writes on episode 4 of the most recent season of Silicon Valley:

‚ÄúI went to China to do New New Internet.‚Äù

That‚Äôs totally something you can do now.

Like for realz.
