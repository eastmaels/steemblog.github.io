Well, a couple days ago, I posted my thoughts on where the crypto markets were headed and where we needed to pay attention to the charts.

Of course, the shellacking put on all cryptos on February 2 has forced me to reevaluate where I think the markets will find support. Hence, I present to you my updated global crypto markets support line!

As I posted yesterday during the crash, it looks to me like $8200/BTC and the $390 B market cap line are critical levels of support. Although we dipped significantly below the $390 B line yesterday (CMC shows a low of $348 B at 8:47 UTC), we only spent at total of 3 hours trading below that critical $390 B line.

On February 3, markets again tested the $390 B line and, so far, have held. At the time I'm writing this, the global market cap for cryptos stands at about $414 billion. So it looks like we are getting some breathing room.

For myself, I'll go back to managing my investments, planning my classes, and caring for my daughter... But I definitely am gonna set an alert for the next time the market cap gets around $390 B!

Stay tuned!
