I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this
![muppet-on-fire.gif](https://steemitimages.com/DQmc7Jpr9Rbzb8RNNCMGig7JfSxjxHdXP1amF3p7iUZ5CFk/muppet-on-fire.gif)
is what the scene was like last weekend in the crypto markets.

Below is a chart showing the steady-eddy decline from precisely Friday at midnight China time (of course!) to Sunday at midnight.

We entered the hangover period for most people's weekends starting at about $340 billion. The 8 am wakeup call then started the descent in earnest. Then gradually gradually the market declined hour by hour for 48 hours until it hit bottom at $275 billion.
## That's a 19.1% decline in just two days.
Let's hope for a better result this time out there on the weekend pitch, boyz.
