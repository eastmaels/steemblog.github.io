It's just not much of a break without a smoke and a quick turn about your cellphone, right?

These cooks in Shanghai quickly "rest up" (‰ºëÊÅØ‰ºëÊÅØ) for the rest of their shift. Chinese millennials are notorious for their cellphone use, to the almost utter-oblivion of everything else.

It's gotten so bad recently that the Communist Youth League has, curiously I might say, produced an mobile app that "cures" cellphone addiction... I mean I don't get it. But this issue, rightly, has been something the Party has been trying to alleviate for a while now.

A recent article in the South China Morning Post also discusses our potential over-reliance on technology to placate, soothe, and otherwise pacify our children. http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2130139/switch-smartphones-save-children-tech-addiction

It's an issue I think about every day. I have to ask myself, "Should a fifteen-month-old child really have access to an iPhone?" The more and more I'm faced with this issue, the more I think reasonable curbs to access to technology for infants, toddlers, and pre-school youth are a must.

Meanwhile, Chinese technology stocks rule the roost over on Wall Street. They're the next hottest thing behind blockchain and marijuana. Absolutely gargantuan companies like Alibaba and Tencent are posting almost shitcoin-type gains, relatively speaking, with, if current technology trends continue, almost no risk at all.

It's all upside from here for China tech. Or is it?
