An investment bank in your pocket. That’s where we’re headed.

When I first moved to China in 2011, I had to carry around three electronic devices wherever I went.

- An iPod, because I needed the Chinese-English dictionary (Pleco is the one I use.) to survive.
- A Flip video camera (Hard to believe this company was once [acquired for $590 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/13/technology/13flip.html), huh? Especially since most of you have probably never heard of it!)
- A Nokia-like brick phone (Tencent had still somehow figured out how to code up a basic version of QQ to put on it. And thank God! Or I would have never been able to court my now wife.)

Oh yeah, and a thick-ass wallet full of business cards, credit cards, and a wad full of paper bills that somehow function as money.

It’s weird. The more deeply I enmesh myself in this digital asset world, the weirder it is whenever I have to pay someone with stacks of fiat. It’s like, “What is THIS?”

I’m convinced that in the not-too-distant future, my now 2-year-old daughter will start to ask me, “Daddy, why did people work so hard day in and day out for THAT stuff? It’s just paper!”

Now I just walk around with my phone. And if the wife is out, I sometimes have to carry my keys.

But that’s it.

Things change. And the more entangled the economy becomes with the exponential tentacles of Moore’s Law and its perpetual iterative effects, the faster things change.

That’s why we’re headed to an investment bank in your pocket. Crypto funds, mutual funds, private equity, venture capital, bonds, startups, hedge funds, and esoteric assets like fractions of art pieces, comic book collections, Legos, and whiskey. Tokenized and compliant and custodied by yourself. All in a cryptographically secure wallet on your phone. Recoverable from your seed phrase.

Mark it down, Dude.
