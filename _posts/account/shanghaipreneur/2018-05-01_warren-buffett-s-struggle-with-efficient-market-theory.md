Interestingly, Warren Buffett does not follow the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) himself. But, in the plainspoken way that only he can get away with, he unequivocally states that, for less talented investors than himself, EMH is most likely the best theory available to guide one's investing.

It's crazy that Buffett is the one making these kinds of statements. After all, it is precisely his consistent investment success that provides the best example of why efficient market theory is preposterous.

But there it is in black-and-white. I even found it on an inspirational quote meme so you know it must be a direct quote from the Oracle of Omaha himself.

Buffet's views on the supposed efficiency of the market are summed up by an oft-repeated parable of his. Mr. Market is an allegory used in Benjamin Graham’s renowned security analysis course at Columbia University. Buffett earned a master of economics there in 1951. If you want to read more about the story of Mr. Market check out my blog post on the subject, [“Who is Mr. Market?”](http://www.lowbetaportfolio.com/who-is-mr-market/), but the basic idea is that Mr. Market represents the senseless everyman investor that we all wish we weren't but know, in our heart of hearts, that we probably are.

He offers practical advice about the vagaries of Mr. Market in the 1987 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Letter to Shareholders:

> But, like Cinderella at the ball, you must heed one warning or everything will turn into pumpkins and mice: Mr. Market is there to serve you, not to guide you. It is his pocketbook, not his wisdom, that you will find useful. If he shows up some day in a particularly foolish mood, you are free to either ignore him or to take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you fall under his influence. Indeed, if you aren’t certain that you understand and can value your business far better than Mr. Market, you don’t belong in the game. As they say in poker, “If you’ve been in the game 30 minutes and you don’t know who the patsy is, you’re the patsy.”

Buffett bases this folksy perspective on his one true and unique skill - his verifiable talent in the field of capital allocation. He even goes so far as to say that he won the “ovarian lottery” by being placed in a political and legal system that for some reason rewards his one particular, and some might even say peculiar, talent in an exponential way. (By the way, the above image is obviously copyright Disney, FYI.)

Robert P. Miles describes Buffett’s famous humblebrag in his book, *Warren Buffett Wealth: Principles and Practical Methods Used by the World's Greatest Investor* (available on Google Play):

> He was gifted with unique skills to value companies, coupled with being born during the time period that would enjoy the greatest economic expansion and would be capitalism’s finest hour to date. One simply cannot underestimate the luck of being born in the United States, home of 4 percent of the world’s population but one half of the world’s capital and publicly traded companies, with a political and legal system that disproportionately rewards capital allocation talent over most other occupations, and during a century that experienced a sevenfold increase in the standard of living. (24)

Buffett understands that he is incredibly lucky to have these talents. And to have them at this particular point in the trajectory of capitalist history. But he also understands that not everyone is preternaturally suited to his unique occupation, nor would they enjoy it as much as he does. In those cases in which people do not share his predisposition to master capital allocation strategy, Buffett believes that EMH serves the majority of “regular” investors in the best way possible.

Note the advice he would give to the investment trustee of his own children that he offers in the 2013 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report:

>My advice to the trustee could not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard's.) I believe the trust's long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors – whether pension funds, institutions or individuals – who employ high-fee managers.

These principles set a high bar for aspiring fund managers. But it is their collective struggle to exceed some benchmark that unleashes the power of efficient market theory in the first place. Buffett's investing philosophy exposes this dialectic for the interminable struggle that it is and forever will be.

Can YOU consistently beat the market? Probably not.

But the fact that YOU and everyone else thinks they can is what makes the market efficient in the first place. This conundrum informs how Buffett stands astride this issue.

Any investor in any given year can do better than the market. But those that do so consistently have a plan, a strategy, a system for continuous improvement that is continually improved upon itself that distinguishes their investments.

Does that sound like you? If not, it's off to the S&P with you.

And that's fine.

Hopefully, understanding Buffet's nuanced position will help us all to
