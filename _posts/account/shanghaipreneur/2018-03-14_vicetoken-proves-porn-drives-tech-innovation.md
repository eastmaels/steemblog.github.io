It's a widely held secret that it's actually the porn industry that drives innovation in tech. So "Thanks Riley!" You and your colleagues are an indispensable part of the American high-tech scene.

A couple of authors in the *Independent*, a weekly out of the UK, wrote an [article](https://vicetoken.com/) in 2009 titled "iSex: How pornography has revolutionized technology." They claimed that innovations in imaging tech from film to photography, Polaroid to digital, camcorders to phones... nearly all of these advances have been driven by the demand for sex products.

Without the porn industry, we'd probably still be on dial-up!

After all, the internet is only for e-mail and message boards. Right?

So now there is a token that will continue in the long line of porn-driven tech innovation.

Ladies and gentlemen, the [Vice Token](https://vicetoken.com/)!

Tagline: #GetPaidToWatchPorn

I mean, how can they lose, right?

ViceToken has already raised more than 24,000 ETH (approx. $15 million @ $625/ETH) and its crowdsale still has another 5+ days to go.

What this says about the crypto markets remains to be seen. I dunno, seems kind of cheap. I mean, it was one thing when porn became free, but now you can get paid to watch it? Oh My Blockchain! According to this recent [Medium article](https://medium.com/@Strange_bt_True/how-big-is-the-porn-industry-fbc1ac78091b) about 12% of all content on the internet is porn. The other 88% is cats.

So there you have it! Porn and cats drive innovation.
