I could care less about whether you are a Democan or a Republicat or a Libertenarian. That's your business! But damn is it hot or what? Like everywhere.

In Kuwait it recently hit 129 degrees fahrenheit. Oh, no, that's not the heat index. That's just how freakin' hot it is. It probably felt like 150 degrees. At that temperature, you could bake a potato all the way through in about 3 hours.

My Uber driver today was joking about frying eggs on the manhole covers here in Shanghai. The heat index only got as high as 111 degrees here today.

Basically all of us just sit in the air conditioning as much as possible, which can't be good for making climate change any better.

Anyways, when it comes to the rest of politics, I'm game for arguing about all sorts of dumb shit - trans in bathrooms, abortions, gays in the military, private funding of education, student loan debt, fiat money, you know the whole 9 - but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE

CAN WE DO SOMETHING TO MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT BETTER, like now?
