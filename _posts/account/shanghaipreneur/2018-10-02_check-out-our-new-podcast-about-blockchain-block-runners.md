Since moving to the big cities of Beijing and Shanghai, I've become a huge fan of podcasts as a means to soak up all of the time I spend commuting from one place to another.

Back in the days of hustle, I could spend 4-5 hours per day on the subway and walking around the city, so I probably have close to my 10,000 hours necessary to become an expert.

It only makes sense, then, that I eventually wanted to start my own!

I've teamed up with a couple old friends of mine to start [Block Runners](https://soundcloud.com/user-535980100). One is the director of the PwC Media Lab here in Shanghai; the other is an aspiring Ethereum developer in New York City.

Between the three of us - a blockchain worker, a newbie, and a developer - we think we've got a unique perspective to bring to the space. We hope you'll follow us on either [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-535980100) or [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/block-runners/id1437172347?mt=2).

Those are the platforms we currently are on. If anyone else has any suggestions for cool podcast platforms, please let us know in the comments below. ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

So why did we choose the name Block Runners?

Well, it's totally based on the classic film *Blade Runner*, one of the all-time favorite films of my family.

Based on Philip K. Dick's amazing novel *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*, the film explores the dualistic nature of technology - its dialectic capacity to bring massive positive change to society as a whole while also containing within it the spectre of potential harms wrought by evil robots and malicious governments.

Blockchain, like any bleeding-edge technology, contains both sides of this coin.

In this way, our podcast will operate as a bladerunner, which is the character played by Harrison Ford whose goal it was to seek out a rogue robot trying to kill its creator.

*Block Runners* will highlight the good and weed out the bad in the blockchain space.

I hope you'll come along for the ride!
