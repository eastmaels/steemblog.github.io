With all this talk about Jamie Dimon's complete reversal on crypto, I thought I'd highlight this [bit of news from 2015](https://www.coindesk.com/digital-currency-scam-jpmorgan-branding).

![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbS8iyAzoUf6hRx7zkY3QeG3YwPvfmeKFzry6XYxDx3a7/JP%20MORGAN.jpg)

Actually, the link above is not even about JP Morgan & Chase Co's obsession with creating a digital asset on the blockchain to mimic the usefulness of bitcoin. I just found that picture on this [old Steemit post from last year](https://steemit.com/jamiedimon/@mardah.resonance/jp-morgan-ceo-fraud-bankster-jamie-dimon-rejected-175-times-trying-to-patent-bitcoin-style-payment-system) by @mardah.resonance and I figured I'd save old @ned the server cost and reuse this fine graphic. For the record, I just find it more than a wee bit funny that the old "Bulge Bracket" bank has been desperately trying (and failing) to make something "bitcoin-y" for a long, long time.

Not only that, but check this out!

Apparently, this is not the first time we've had a "JPM Coin" in the cryptocurrency industry. Some Chinese scammers used this exact name brand back in 2015 to try and rope some unsuspecting retail investors (in China, they call them "leeks") in to what was basically an MLM scheme.

It got so bad that the China division of JPMorgan Chase & Co. had to [issue a statement](https://www.jpmorgan.com/country/US/en/jpmorgan/china/cn/news/jpm-coin-statement) on Oct. 30, 2015. 

摩根大通获悉，一些网站、微博以及微信平台正在推广销售摩根币(JPM Coin)。这些网站、微博和微信平台均与摩根大通及其集团公司无关。摩根大通及其在华或全球的任何关联机构均未发售该名为“摩根币 (JPM Coin)”的产品。摩根大通并未授权任何此类或其它类似的虚拟货币，也未授权以任何方式提及JPMorgan,摩根大通，摩根等。

Here is the English translation:

"JPMorgan Chase learned that some websites, Weibo Corporation and WeChat platforms are promoting the sale of JPM Coin. These websites, Weibo and WeChat platforms are not related to JP Morgan Chase and its group companies. JPM Coin and its affiliates in China or around the world have not sold the product called JPM Coin. JPMorgan does not authorize any such or other similar virtual currency, nor does it authorize any reference to JPMorgan, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan, etc."

Which all leads me to ask the question,

So, when issuing its first bitcoin-like cryptoasset, out of all the potential names one could pick, why would JP Morgan Chase use the exact same branding as the 2015 scammers? 🤔

Inquiring minds want to know.
