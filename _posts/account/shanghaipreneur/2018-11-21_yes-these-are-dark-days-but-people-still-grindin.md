It's not been a very good few days in Cryptoland. Bitcoin is down. Ethereum is lower than I've ever seen it, except for that time my buddy told me to look into it back when it was trading at $11.

You know that guy. He didn't buy it either, but somehow he knew about it in early 2016. Somehow.

Maybe we'll get that chance again, buddy!

Dark days indeed.

YouTube cryptocurrency advocates are jumping off the figurative bridge like lemmings and "blockchain enthusiasts" all over the world are, at best, crying in their beer.

A lot of them are taking the label "blockchain enthusiast" off of their LinkedIn profile. Maybe even for good. This classic meme has lost a couple of its job descriptors. How sad!

But the wind keeps blowing. As it tends to do, the water keeps flowing down to the sea.

People are still investing in blockchain. Yesterday, one huge $16 million investment was made by the big boys, Fenbushi Capital, Michael Novogratz, Block.one, OKcoin, et al., in a blockchain gaming startup named [Mythical Games](https://mythical.games/). The venture was founded by an impressive array of gaming executives with roots at Activision, Blizzard, and Yahoo.

It's cool stuff. Check it out.

# So where do I think this market is headed from here?

I honestly don't know. For months, I held to the glimmer of hope that we would not go below the old Bitcoin Cash FUD low from around this time last year.

Yeah, that was from back when the last time old Faketoshi got a stick up his butt and started getting angry about god knows what. Boy, was I wrong!

So in reality, I think that this downward spiral is not fully over. But I would say that prices are just beginning to look reasonable around here.

Finally.

I am definitely enjoying the cheap STEEM. We'll see if I pick up anything else in the near future.

Every day that we have a reasonable industry is another day where we rid ourselves of the scammers & fraudsters that ruined this fledgling young industry throughout the past year.

Like Nietzsche said, "Whatever doesn't kill us makes us stronger."

Those are the only words of comfort I can think of right now. And I think cases like this [pressICO one](https://www.thedailybeast.com/grifter-journalist-jerry-ji-guo-jailed-for-alleged-bitcoin-long-con) that I read about today are exactly what he meant.

Oh, just looking at [this website](https://www.pressico.com/) for their ICO makes me mad. It's so easy to scam people with slick graphics and a litany of empty promises.
# Agggghhhhh!

So good riddance to this Jerry Ji Guo guy. Have fun rotting in a federal prison. I look forward to hearing more stories like this one in the coming months.

But that's one less scammer/fraudster hype man piece of trash that will distract us from the long-term goal of using blockchain to make the world a better, more equitable, and transparent place. My heart goes out to David Ritter and my friends at [Penta](https://www.penta.global/) for getting duped by this scum.

But hey, it happens.

And when it does, there's only one thing left to do:

Keep BUIDL-ing your startup!

## Have a good Turkey Day week, everybody!!!!
