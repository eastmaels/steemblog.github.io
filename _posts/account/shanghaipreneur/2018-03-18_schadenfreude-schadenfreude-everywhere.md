Some people are masochists.

They derive pleasure from watching another person experience misfortune.

That's not really me. But in the crypto game, when I'm standing on the sidelines with some fiat ready... Well,

The schadenfreude is real.

That is, at least, until you convert your fiat into crypto and then, all of a sudden, you're the one on the inside looking out through the smoke. That instant buyer's remorse seething below the blood's boil.

So that's why I've learned an important lesson with investing:

# SCALE IN, SCALE OUT
The best way to think about this maxim is to think of the famous old farm saying "Don't put all your eggs into one basket," but extended through time. I often catch myself saying, "Diversify through time." I know that might not make any sense to other people. So let me try to explain.

I'm pretty accustomed to holding a concentrated portfolio of only a few major positions, but what I've learned is to **never ever never ever never** do is to put all of my eggs in one basket *at one time*.

Never go big all at once.

Slow and steady wins this race. Slow and steady has always won this race.

Just look at that dern turtle from this Depression-era Disney cartoon. Looks like he's still got some fiat, too!

Schadenfreude.

Schadenfreude everywhere.
