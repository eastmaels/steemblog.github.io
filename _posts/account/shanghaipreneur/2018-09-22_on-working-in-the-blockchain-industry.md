I have been involved with or directly working for a company in the blockchain industry for over a year now. I've seen the nosebleed highs as well as the debilitating lows. I no longer really care about what number my Blockfolio balance is willing to blare out to me 24/7/365.

Crypto is not about lambos and moons and creating some idealized anarcho-libertarian universe where everyone is their own bank and The Man gets unceremoniously taken out through the back door.

There are plenty of projects for that! And I wish them luck. I'll even own some of their cryptocurrency for the long term. You know, just in case...

For me, working in the blockchain industry is more about supporting and encouraging meaningful change.

The kind of change that impacts lives.

The kind of change that can be meaningfully measured.

The kind of change that you can tell your family about.

The kind of change we need.

But change not just in the sense that a politician uses it.

Real change that impacts lives and transforms society. Satoshi Nakomoto created Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology in the hopes that it might one day lead to a more equitable society where the distance between the haves and the have-nots was no longer as wide as an ocean and widening. Being born of a particular color in a particular country determines 95% of your fate these days. And that's not right.

Something needs to change. And fast.

For me, we can only solve this tremendous problem and bring benefits to the global economy if we increase blockchain adoption tremendously.

That means always doing this handy list of 3 action items:
* Work with the right people who care about the right things,
* Encourage every smart person you meet to learn more and get involved, and
* Call out the folks using blockchain technology as just another pyramid Ponzi scheme.

We have to do these three things over and over. And over and over. And over and over again. Until we're blue in the face and have made the same statement a million times before. Sure, the people nearest to you are going to get tired of hearing you repeatedly tell the same stories.

But we owe it to ourselves and our future.

Blockchain might be the last chance we get to create a digital future unlike our analog past.
