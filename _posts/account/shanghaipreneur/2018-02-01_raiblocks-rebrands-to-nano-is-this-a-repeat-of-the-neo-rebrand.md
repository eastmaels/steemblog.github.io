Big news on what is becoming the "new normal" in the crypto markets today - low volume down days. Hey, it happens to all the markets at some point. It's a normal part of a consolidation phase. Consolidation patterns look like this:

So I'm still not worried about the cryps. Plus, there's exciting news today that could be potentially profitable!

RaiBlocks - the crypto you never really knew what exactly it was about... Did they just forget to put an L in the name? Is it like a railroad blockchain project? Does XRB have anything to do with being exorbitant? ... Well they have now rebranded to NANO, according to an announcement posted on their Medium page: https://medium.com/@nanocurrency/nano-rebrand-announcement-9101528a7b76

And you might be thinking, "Wait a minute, didn't some other coin do a rebrand and make a bunch of gains afterwards?" And you'd be right. You'd be thinking of NEO, which concluded its rebrand from AntShares on, of course, 8-8-17. The significance there being that NEO is THE China coin and Chinese people are just obsessed with 8s. I mean, they even arranged to host the Summer Olympics just so they could start the ceremony exactly at 8:08 pm on 8-8-08. It's true.

So how did NEO do since the rebrand? Oh, I'd say not bad.

At its high of near $200 per coin, NEO returned nearly 10x since its rebrand. At today's prices of around $130 per coin, that's still a healthy six-bagger IN LESS THAN HALF A YEAR.

Could a similar ramp-up be in store for RailBocks, um, I mean NANO?
