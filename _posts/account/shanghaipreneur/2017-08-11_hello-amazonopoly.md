Amazon is an e-commerce behemoth, a sprawling media empire, an airport, soon a luxury grocery store... No wonder Jeff Bezos was officially the richest man in the world for maybe 24 hours. Though he is now an unceremonious #2, he still gets President Trump fired up. Maybe the Great Coiffed One does not threaten the "fury" like he does with No. 3 Fat over in the Hermit Kingdom, but Trump does on occasion get himself in a tizzy over the "Amazon Washington Post." And though, yes, Bezos' company has nothing technically to do with Bezos' newspaper, it's probably time that we officially begin the watch for this administration's high-profile anti-trust investigation into the purveyors of Prime entertainment and online products.

Remember the last time this happened? The United States v. Microsoft Corp. basically forced the company run by the world's then-richest man to stand still for a decade. On the day the settlement was proposed on Nov 2. 2001, MSFT traded at $27 per share. When the settlement decree finally expired, unenforced, it traded at $25. During Microsoft's lost decade, the company missed out on massive opportunities in search, e-commerce, smart phones and social media. Would Bill Gates' company have acted differently without the specter of anti-trust action perpetually hanging over it?

Absolutely. Michael Cusumano, a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management in 2011, told the Seattle Times, “Since the antitrust suit, they have become much more cautious and much less aggressive... They’re afraid, it seems. Whether it’s antitrust in U.S. or in Europe, they seem to be slowly reacting to the world around them, rather than trying to get in there fast.”

During the period dominated by potential anti-trust legislation, Gates would broker a deal to save Apple. From a purely business standpoint, this move made no sense. But taking into account the anti-trust concerns, Gates felt compelled to make a $150 million investment in Apple preferred shares. The cash infusion would save Apple from bankruptcy and preserve a viable competitor to Microsoft. Apple then went on to reinvent the music and cellphone industries. Microsoft stuck to its knitting, selling operating systems and office software and not much else. What else could it do?

If Amazon faced anti-trust action, would they be able to continue their aggressive expansion into nearly every sector of the US economy? Could they do much more than Microsoft did?

There is no love lost between Donald Trump and Jeff Bezos. Campaign Trump warned us that Amazon has "a huge antitrust problem." Is it possible that a new attorney general to replace the neutered Jeff Sessions would be encouraged to go after Bezos' pride and joy? Could Trump just wake up one morning and feel like doing it and do it?

The first step may occur when Democrats in the Senate bluster over Amazonopoly's proposed Whole Foods acquisition. U.S. Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) penned a letter to the House Judiciary Committee requesting hearings on Amazon’s Whole Foods acquisition. He claims that the deal is another in a long line of mergers that have “decreased wages and resulted in gross inequality in the workplace.”

“Amazon’s proposed acquisition of Whole Foods raises important questions concerning competition policy, such as how the transaction will affect the future of retail grocery stores, whether platform dominance impedes innovation, and if the antitrust laws are working effectively to ensure economic opportunity, choice and low prices for American families,” Cicilline wrote.

Another arrow in the anti-trust quiver is Amazon's appetite for airports. In January, Amazon announced a $1.5 billion investment in Northern Kentucky to develop its own air cargo hub. The lease is for acreage nearly one-and-a-half times FedEx's headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee. There are also rumors that Amazon may buy an airport in Germany. Wait... so Amazon is trying to put how many companies out of business?

At some point, government regulators have to ask, "How is having all of these disparate assets under one corporate umbrella not violate some or all of the extant anti-trust statutes?"

I'm not a lawyer. But I can read the legal writing on the wall. Amazonopoly is happening right before our eyes. Eventually, some lawmaker or regulator is going to want to make a name for themselves by going after the richest guy in the world and his leviathan company.

It is here that Amazon's strategy will backfire. As opposed to the rising Asian internet super-conglomerates like Alibaba, Softbank, and Tencent, which emphasize complex cross-ownership structures in their capital accumulation, AMZN prefers to wholly own and operate all of its various operations and subsidiaries.

Not exactly a good argument when you're trying to prove you're NOT an Amazonopoly.
