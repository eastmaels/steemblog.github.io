Probably one of the best and most needed applications of blockchain technology is using it for voting.

A lot of people outside the US may not realize that American elections have been largely based on electronic voting machines ever since the 2000 election. If there were such a thing is an internet meme back then, ‚Äúhanging chads in Florida‚Äù would have definitely made national headlines.

Let's revisit this ridiculous piece of American history. Imgur is waiting for your contributions!

And for the win, my absolute favorite:

Meme away, Internet! Hopefully someone somewhere out there reads my posts and we'll get some nice work from the meme mines to spread about during the upcoming Trump-dominated mid-term election cycle.

For those of you under 30, let me explain to you what a "hanging chad" is exactly. Before we used computers to automatically tabulate election results according to the data blindly entered into a private database controlled by a few poorly paid election officials, each voter used to fill out their voting preferences on an actual piece of paper. To automate this tedious process, we invented paper with a pre-cut dimple that voters were supposed to fully detach from the whole piece of paper in order to indicate their vote. Tabulation machines were then created that could be fed stacks and stacks of voting paper at a time to deliver election results quickly.

A "hanging chad" looks like this:

As you can see, it is literally impossible to tell the true intent of the voter. Did this chad become hanging due to the voter pressing it in? Or did it get caught up in the tabulating machinery and detach all by itself?

This pedantic debate basically gave us George W. Bush. Weird, right? I know.

In an effort to avoid this particularly weird debate in the subsequent 2004 presidential election, the US turned to digital voting machines to execute the election. However, as is often the case, solving one problem usually just leads to a host of new problems.

Sure enough, with the not-as-close-but-still-pretty-close Bush v. Kerry presidential election came claims of digital ballot box stuffing, particularly in ‚Äúpurple‚Äù regions where the results were close enough that an extra 10,000 votes here or there striped into the protocol via programming ‚Äúback doors‚Äù could swing an entire election. Such claims of corruption have persisted from both Democrats and Republicans to this day.

Blockchain and crypto is the solution for ending this kind of corruption.

[NEM](https://nem.io/) & innovative projects like [Agora](https://www.agora.vote/) are working on exactly that.

NEM is a 3rd-generation blockchain that is focused on creating usable enterprise solutions. For instance, my company, [DarcMatter](https://darcmatter.com/), plans to utilize the hybrid public/private nature of their technology to better serve our customers. However, NEM has recently been focusing on the [voting use case](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-electoral-commission-uses-nem-blockchain-for-voting-trial), having recently partnered with the Ukrainian government to help make democratic elections in that Eastern European nation more transparent and secure.

Agora.vote is a fantastic Ethereum-based project that will hopefully help us secure democracy for the next generation. They have already assisted with an election in Africa and have recently come to [an agreement with Diginex](https://paymentweek.com/2018-8-13-diginex-partners-agora-provide-blockchain-based-voting-asia/) to provide voting systems in Asia. According to their website, blockchain-based voting is ‚Äútamper-proof, private, accessible, affordable, and tension-less.‚Äù

That's the way elections should be.

Thanks, blockchain!

You're the best. üòç
