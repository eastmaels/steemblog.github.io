On beautiful early spring mornings like today, it's a pleasure to stroll about the magnificent pearl of the Orient. Recently, on just such a day, I had occasion to be on the newly developed/developing waterfront of the Lower Bund. I had just left a breakfast meeting and, turning to the left, saw this:

The Pudong skyline looking out over the Lujiazui district back across the Huangpu river towards the old Shanghai *laocheng* literally encompasses the word "high finance." The painstakingly wrought, over the last 26 years, symbol of the rise of "new China" is an interesting contrast to what one sees when one merely turns one's head to the right and walks a bit down the nearby street.

Just across the main thoroughfare dividing the waterfront retail district from a seemingly-forever-under-construction new residential district, we have a thriving local market built into the first floor of a tenement building built in the early days of Deng Xiaoping's *kaifang* or "open reform" era, most likely during the late 80s or early 90s. The entrepreneurial spirit of the 100+ local workers buzzing about the place even in the late morning hours is palpable. One can imagine how thriving this place must be in the prime shopping hours of 7 am to 9 am.

Yet, these are the kind of intensely local and vibrant scenes that are being replaced by the steel-faced mountains of commerce that are amassing quickly on a curious finger of the Huangpu River delta that once was merely a sleepy port for fishermen and excess tonnage that couldn't be offloaded on the much busier ports located on the Bund.

Before the recent revamp of the Lower Bund, most of the surrounding area looked like this:

Blocks and blocks of low-slung buildings, crowded up against the streets to maximize commercial square footage, yet with interior sections somehow providing enough room tucked away amongst byzantine alleyways, creating an open space warm and welcoming enough to forge a community of friendly smiles and vigilant neighbors.

That part of Shanghai is slowly receding. It has to. Shanghai and its surrounding eponymous province command an economy that is larger than most countries! At $473 billion in 2017, the Shanghai economy would rank 26th in the world if it were a country, between Belgium and Thailand. On top of that, its economy is [growing at 6.9%](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201801/20/WS5a629e9ba3106e7dcc135729.html), much much faster than its current rivals on the GDP League Table.

Thus, these interesting, informative, and transformative contrasts shall persist for the expected Shanghai future. After all, it is the nature of ["contradiction"](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm) that has always propelled this country forward.

Until these "contradictions" eventually resolve themselves, as they always eventually do, we should enjoy these brief moments of clarity in time when we can observe two so potent and dominant visions of society exist simultaneously side-by-side. At least, that is, until one of those visions eventually shuffles off stage left, as all political economies eventually do.

The essential spirit of Shanghai will still remain. Whether its in [FinTech](http://www.fintechconnector.com) or e-commerce, IoT devices or mobile gaming, fish hawking or vegetable selling,  the pattern is still the same.

*Shanghairen* work hard and they're pretty darn efficient in going about it. And they certainly get up everyday way before this *laowai* has even finished his breakfast!

That's why I call them **Shanghaipreneurs**.
