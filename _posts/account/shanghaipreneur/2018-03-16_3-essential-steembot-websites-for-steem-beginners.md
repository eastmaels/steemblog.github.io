I've been writing on STEEM for a little while now and thought it might be time for what I call a "meta post".

Getting meta seems to be what it's all about in the self-help/side-gig guru economy.

Can't make money off your own content website? Make a website about making content websites and sell access to that.

Can't sell products online? Make a website about selling products online and then sell those products about selling products as products themselves.

So I'm going meta.

Watch this be the most upvoted post I've ever had.

What drove me to write this post? Well, I think for many people who are just getting started with Steemit, even just getting used to the functions of the STEEM cryptocurrency and how to manipulate that to your own benefit can be difficult to comprehend. Much less is discussed about getting your head up above water, so to speak, on the platform.

A lot of great content falls through the cracks because it never gets the first flurry of upvotes that will get it swept up in to the "Trending" or "Hot" sections of the website.

Why do we risk letting great content fall through the cracks? Well, the number one reason is that the author has refused to invest in any STEEM in order to show that they have "skin in the game".

And, yeah I know, not everyone has the investment capital to "prime the pump" when it comes to their steemwallets. That's understandable. We don't want to restrict access to Steemit at all whatsoever. But I'm just highlighting that fact as the primary reason new authors do not gain traction on the platform. Once you've gotten a bit of spare SBD from posting and curating for a while (or buy loading up your account from an exchange)... you'll need to start "mining" some upvotes from many of the great steembots that are available.

Here are a list of three great resources to start your journey off right with steembots:

- [SmartSteem.com](https://smartsteem.com/) üë®üèª‚Äçüè´

Here is a very simple and easy place where you can go to buy guaranteed profitable upvotes for your content. Just hit the "Buy Votes Now" and throw your in your individual information and post link, jam in your key and you're good to go. A gaggle of votes, usually with little to no weight, will flock to your post over the next few minutes. Bonus: This bot does not spam your post with a comment letting everyone know you've upvoted yourself with a bot. But they might get a little suspicious when you have 56 upvotes and only 20 views. Just sayin'... Anyways, minnows got to do whatever they can to survive on Steemit, so whatevs... which brings me to my 2nd resource:

- [Minnowbooster.net](https://www.minnowbooster.net/) üêü

Minnowbooster is a marketplace that makes it easy for you to lease your STEEM Power out to other people or, if you're thinking about gearing up for a content blitz, you may want to think about leasing STEEM Power for yourself for a time. But before you start getting into the vast potential profits of delegating STEEM Power, the first thing you might want to do is sell your vote to minnowbooster in order to earn SBD on your curation. Basically, if you aren't voting on something every day, you are wasting some of your ability as a STEEMholder to earn block rewards from curating content. If you're not gonna use your STEEM Power, why not let minnowbooster use it on your behalf and cut you in on the profits?

- [SteemBotTracker.com](https://steembottracker.com) ü§ñ

This is an amazing website. I can't even believe it's free. Here, among other steembot madness, @yabapmatt maintains a list of all the active upvote bots and when they will be voting their vote. Essentially, the perfect cycle for upvoting is 2 hours, 24 minutes. It takes that long to fully charge your vote to the 100% level. So upvote bots hold auctions for their votes (which, on some bots, are augmented by massive amounts of STEEM Power) and then divvy up that vote to the bidders according to their bids every 2 hours, 24 minutes. Once you have a bit of a stack of SBD, these bots can really be profitable. But beware - You can also lose STEEM bidding on upvote bots if too many people bid on the same bot in the same period. So keep your eyes peeled on SteemBotTracker.com and put in your bids at the last minute eBay-style.

There you have it.

I've gone meta.
