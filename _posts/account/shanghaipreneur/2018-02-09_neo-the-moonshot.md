Da Hongfei Speech at NEO DevCon sets the bar for the NEO blockchain even higher. Since rebranding his not-for-profit organization's product from AntShares to NEO just over half a year ago, the governing token of the NEO Foundation's public blockchain, known famously by its trading ticker NEO, has exploded in value.

I had seen the Chinese media on WeChat about this speech given in San Francisco on February 2, 2018 and it had looked pretty spectacular. Flashy color-coordinated signs. Fancy new English slogans. Stuff about NEX - supposedly the world's first "perfect" decentralized exchange. But let's face it. It was all in Chinese. I'm lazy.

And Chinese is hard. So even though there might be some cryptomarket shattering news buried somewhere in the sinewy characters, I'm just gonna wait for the English press to get their hands on it and let me know what's up.

And that finally happened today! Six days later on Coin Central. https://coincentral.com/neo-new-vision-moonshot/

As an industry, we have to do a better job at doing timely, responsible reporting. But hey, it's a fledgling young industry. It'll get figured out. There'll probably be an ICO for it. There's more than a fighting chance that it'll end up being STEEM.

Anyways, Da Hongfei's aspirations are certainly lunar in nature. With direct references to JFK's famous "moon speech" and the goal “to make NEO the No.1 blockchain by 2020” certainly support the new branding.

Here it is:

NEO: The Moonshot.

The New Vision.

I mean it's quite the rhetoric. The rapidity with which Da has learned to carry himself over the past year is certainly remarkable. A speech delivered with poise and humor had more than 500 audience members rapt bathing in the ubiquitous neon-green glow of NEO. He is truly becoming a visionary leader (and losing some weight!) and that bodes a prosperous future for the NEO coin and its stakeholders.
