This book is surprisingly easy to read. The last time I read "The Vanish of Elephants", except for "I Met One Hundred Percent Perfect Girl", the other story made me very confused. This time,  "After the Quake", except for the story of a trip to Thailand, the others are very easy to enter the story.

My favorite is the story of a frog saving Tokyo. The images of the frog are reliable, powerful. They are willing to work hard for a seemingly impossible goal, especially moving.

I also like the story of the honey party. The love story of three of them made me very worried. Especially that kiss. Many things that do not exist in real life are in that unfruitful kiss.

That story about UFO is also good. But it is embarrassing It's like I'm watching LOST and seeing the end is the feeling of the drama. However, if not, isn't it more like Higashino Koigo's style? It is Murakami that this unclear conclusion has been extended to life.

This book is thin. If you love Haruki Murakami's book you may wish to try.

English isn't my mother tongue, I am still learning. I try to read more English book and write down what I thought. Hope I can improve my English.
