Never thought of such a book.

He met Shimamoto at the age of 12. Two people often listened to music together. The greatest physical contact was hand.

He met Izumi in high school. She had blowjob for him but refused the last step. She asked him to wait and wait in the field.

He didn't want to wait until Izumi's cousin goes to bed.

After Izumi knew, he broke up with him.

3
At the age of 28, he met Shimamoto again on the street, but in the end he did not have a chance to say anything.

At the age of 30, he was married, had children, two daughters, bought a car, and operated his own bar.

4
At the age of 37, Shimamoto came to the bar where he operated.

He accompanied Shimamoto to bid farewell to Shimamoto's daughter.

One day, Shimamoto brought a gift to the record they had heard in their childhood.

They went to the holiday home to listen to records, make love, and tell each other's love.

When he woke up the next day, Shimamoto disappeared.

Shimamoto never appeared again.
