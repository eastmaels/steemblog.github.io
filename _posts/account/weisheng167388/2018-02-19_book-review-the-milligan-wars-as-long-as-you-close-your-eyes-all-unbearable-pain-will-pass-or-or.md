我以前读过《24个比利》，这本《比利战争》是其续作。讲述的是比利从1979年被关进精神病医院一直到1991年法院正式宣布他的假释刑期结束这期间比利的经历。书的最后，比利在绝食1个多月之后，终于融合了。
I've read "24 Billy" before. This "Billy War" is the sequel. It is about Billy's experience with Billy from the time he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in 1979 until the court officially announced the end of his probation in 1991. At the end of the book, Billy finally converged after more than a month of hunger strike.

是的，融合。因为比利是一个精神分裂症患者。他在童年遭遇继父的虐待和性侵犯之后就陆续产生了23个不同的人格。这些人格不单单是性格不同，他们甚至有不同的国籍，不同的性别，不同的外貌（不同的人格照镜子时会看见不同的样貌）……这些人格中有内向的孩子，也有心狠手辣的恶棍，有擅长绘画的艺术家，也有能轻松撬开锁子的窃贼……
Yes, integration. Because Billy is a schizophrenic. He developed 23 different personalities after childhood abuse and sexual assault by his stepfather. These personalities are not simply different in character, they even have different nationalities, different genders, different appearances (different personalities may see different appearances as they look in the mirror) ... These introverted children have ruthless villains , There are artists who are good at painting, and thieves who can easily pry the lock ...

书的最后，比利在绝食1个多月之后，陆续将这些分裂的人格埋葬，重新融合成为一个完整的，唯一的比利。
At the end of the book, after more than a month of hunger strike, Billy gradually bury these divided personalities and reintegrate them into a complete and only Billy.

融合后的比利，对自己曾经犯下的罪行表示悔恨，对罪行的源头，以及让自己产生精神分裂的源头——继父，表示原谅。
After the merger, Billy expressed regret for the crimes he had committed, forgiveness for the source of the crime and for causing himself to be the source of schizophrenia - stepfather.

书中这么写：
>我要让他知道我已经原谅他了，那么他的灵魂也就可以原谅那个小时候曾经伤害过他的人。宽恕也许可以一直上溯到过去并改变未来。人们必须停止互相伤害。

The book is written:
> I want to let him know I have forgive him, then his soul will be able to forgive that child who had hurt him. Forgiveness may go back to the past and change the future. People must stop hurting each other.

我读《24个比利》和《比利的战争》，最早是被24个完全不同的独立人格所吸引，是属于猎奇的心态；读的过程中一方面为比利的经历牵心挂肚，一方面也精神病院中病人所受到的非人待遇感到震惊，这时猎奇的心态渐渐淡了，取而代之的是关注。
My reading of "24 Billy" and "Billy Wars" was originally attracted by 24 completely different independent personalities and a curiosity. While reading, I was worried about Billy's experience , On the one hand, they were also shocked by the inhuman treatment suffered by the patients in the mental hospital. At this time, the curiosity of curiosity gradually faded away, and replaced by attention.

当读到最后，比利成功融合。通过原谅，获得新生。这是救赎……
When finally read, Billy succeeded in merging. By forgiveness, get a new life. This is redemption ...

最后想说的是，比利值得同情，然而故事最初被比利伤害的三名女性也不应该被遗忘。我也忍不住在想，如果受伤害的人是我自己，看这本书的时候，是会原谅，还是会更愤怒？
Finally, to say that Billy is sympathetic, the three women who were initially injured by Billy should not be forgotten. I can not help but think, if the injured person is myself, look at this book, will be forgive, or will be more angry?

5
每个人都有自己的救赎，你的在哪里？
Everyone has his own redemption, where is yours?
