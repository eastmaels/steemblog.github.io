***The Elephant Vanishes*** is a short story written by Haruki Murakami. 

I like most of the three stories in this book. The first one is ***One Hundred Percent Perfect Girl***, the second is ***Silence***, and the third is ***The Elephant Vanishes***.

In the story of ***One Hundred Percent Perfect Girl***, I read about the word **miss**. Once missed, it cannot be recovered. People pass by in crowds. The choice is always accompanied by loss. If you remain silent, you lose your chance to speak. If you are depressed, you will lose the chance of release.  If you choose to be someone else, you can't become a true self.

If, everyone has such a word in mind. If.

I also like ***Silence***. The main thing is to like the characters in the book. Murakami Haruki's many stories have such a strong big man. He practices judo or likes to swim. He is always silent and listens well. He knows who he is and how he wants to achieve his goals. He has few friends and even no friends, but once he has made friends, he is a confidante. His body is full of power and you feel oppressed when you face him. But at the same time, his mind is delicate.

Many story have such a kind of man. For example, the brother of ***Fullmetal Alchemist***, the leader of ***1Q84***, the Iron Man in ***The Death Knight*** and this big man in ***Silence***.

The last thing I want to say is ***The Elephant Vanishes***. I like to write in the book that the elephants is slowly getting smaller, then it suddenly goes out, in dark, and finally disappears. This scene is whimsical and can be seen in front of others.

Looking at online reviews, many people think that the elephants in the book represent the good things that have disappeared in human nature or society. Maybe it makes sense. It's just that I can't think so deep. I just find it interesting.

English isn't my mother tongue, I am still learning. I try to read more English book and write down what I thought. Hope I can improve my English.
