**35**
鸟儿愿如云朵常驻天空
云朵愿如鸟儿停落枝头


**The original：**
The bird wishes it were a cloud. The cloud wishes it were a bird.


**女儿说：**
Because the cloud thoughts that the bird cannot fly and the bird thoughts the cloud can fly but the real reason is that they all can fly.


>《飞鸟集》是泰戈尔老先生的作品。里面的诗歌隽永，优美而又充满哲理。每天翻译一首，愿与诸君共赏。
>Stray Birds, written by Rabindranath Tagore, is a collection of poetic aphorisms, remarkable for their simplicity but resonating deeply with fundamental truths of being, life, love, and the marvels of our universe. I translate a poem form Stray Birds to Chinese every day, hope more and more people get to know Tagore's great work.
