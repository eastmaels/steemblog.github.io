My son David is a big fan of Thomas &amp; His Friends trains. So we decided to make the hearts from his collection trains.

All the mini trains made up a small heart and surrounded by all the regular sized trains which made up a bigger heart.

These two hearts are giving to Fundition.io for all the great jobs you have done!
<h3>Love is all around and make the world better place by giving hearts at fundition.io!</h3>
