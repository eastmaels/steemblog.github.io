## Hunter's comment
OfferUp just recently becomes the biggest mobile marketplace for local buyer and seller.
With more than 42 millions users, you can easily sell or buy stuffs.
You can simply list your items using your phone or table in as little as 30 seconds.
Each transaction you made, buyer or seller will give you a reputation score which help people define good/bad buyers/sellers.

OfferUp just launched a new shipping feature which amps up marketplace battle with eBay and Craigslist.
Now, you are not limited to deal locally.

OfferUp is really a great App. It helps me sell tons of unwanted items.
