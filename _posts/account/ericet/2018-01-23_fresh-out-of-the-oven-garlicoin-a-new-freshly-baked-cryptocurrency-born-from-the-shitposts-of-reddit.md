On December 25, 2017, Reddit user u/DigitalizedOrange presented his dream to the newly-found Garlicoin community: to create a cryptocurrency to revolutionize the memecoin market. Shortly there-after, the community exploded into action - a development team was assembled rapidly and the testnet went live shortly after. 
   On the 21st of January at 2pm EST, the mainnet was made public and the memecoin market was changed forever.
