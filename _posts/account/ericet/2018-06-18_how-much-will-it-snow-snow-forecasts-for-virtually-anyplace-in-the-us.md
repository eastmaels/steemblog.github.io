I'm sharing a useful website to anyone who is curious about how much snow we have gotten.
It's called How Much Will It Snow? https://howmuchwillitsnow.com/

Here is the front page, just enter your city or zip code will tell you how much snow you have gotten. (US city only)

This shows how much snow the city I live have gotten from 2011 to 2018. To date, the total snowfall is 43 inches(approximate 109cm) and 2013/2014 we got 57 inches of snow(approximate 145cm)

The blue squares in the picture represent when did the snowfall occur, the stronger the color means more snow we have gotten.

Just a fun site to share. Please upvote me if you find it useful or interesting. Cheers!
