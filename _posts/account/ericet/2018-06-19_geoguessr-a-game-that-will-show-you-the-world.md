## Hunter's comment
It's a game you can play with yourself or play with friends.
It's a simple game, and it's based on the google street view.
When you start the game, it will place you somewhere in the world. And you job is figure out where you are!

You can move along the road, turn around to look, or zoom in or out, using the arrows or mouse.

Once you think you know where you are, you open a map of the world, zoom in, and click where you think you are.
Once you guess, a results screen instantly shows you how close you were. 

I play with my colleagues during lunch and it's a really good game to connect people.
