The founder of one of the largest cryptocurrency businesses in China appears willing to work more closely with the government.

A screen capture of the group chat further shows that Xu told the staff he had also briefed the PBOC on OKCoin's overseas expansion plan, its research on blockchain development and notably, a commitment that the firm is "prepared to donate it to the country anytime in the future."

However, the firm did not further clarify what exactly is to be donated - whether it's the group's crypto exchange business or the blockchain research results, or elaborate on why Xu would make such a claim.
