## SACRED UNICORN
>No one can tell why the Unicorns of the Splinterlands have become so aggressive lately. When they take the offensive, these beautiful and ethereal beasts become rabid and ruthless agents of chaos. Their piercing horns can break through a thick wall of Dragonglass, and their healing abilities make them difficult to stop with any weapon.

Sacred Unicorn is one of my favorite. Simply because he's handsome looking and good stats. 

He has nice attack skill plus he can heal himself when he's injured. A must have for the Life splinter team.

My wife is currently learning crochet, so she made this sacred unicorn for one of my son's classmates as a Christmas gift:

Have you wondered why his neck is so long? Because it's a unicorn style pen~

I was able to capture some steps of her work:

1. Create the pen holder

2. Make the head and the neck

玩steemmonsters的游戏很久了，应该是第一次参加他们的创作活动。活动链接：[Splinterlands Art Contest! // Week 62](https://www.steemcn.org/spt/@splinterlands/splinterlands-art-contest-week-62-15-booster-pack-prize)

活动要求也很简单，到steemmonsters里面选一张卡片的图片来创作或者随便创作一个新人物。可以是绘画，可以是手工，只要是创作就行。需要过程介绍。

每周会选出5位获奖者，分享15个卡包。同时参赛的作品还会获得@steemmonsters的点赞~
