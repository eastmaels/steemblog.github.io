## Hunter's comment
China has its own version of Facebook and search engine in form of Baidu, Music tools like Shrimp, QQ etc. that are very popular among Chinese people.

However, one of the most common problem that these Chinese face is that in most places, these apps/services are not accessible.

This is where VPNs comes to rescue. However, not all VPNs support these apps. Transocks VPN is a specially designed VPN for access of Chinese services like YouKu, Cool Dog Music, Shrimp Music and Baidu.



The good thing about Transocks is that its totally free to join and there is no registration required to get enrolled. Moreover, you will get free premium bandwidth to access your favorite Chinese websites on your phone, Windows PC/Laptop or Macbook.
