This is my entry for the @blocktrades contest. Thanks @anomadsoul and thanks @blocktrades for the sponsorship.

I've been on steemit almost 10 months. It becomes my daily routine to publish posts mostly everyday since I joined. I'm not sure the exact number of posts I've been published but it's more than 3 times a week even the STEEM price is going to the ground.

I like to engage new people on steemit. From the stats @dailychina published everyday, I'm always one of the top 20 most active CN members daily.

I'm not only part of multiple communities and also creator of some communities. 
<strong>@team-cn:</strong> This is a CN community for newbies. Created by @honoru, @softmetal and myself back in April 2018. This community introduces newbies to the CN community and also provides some guidances to them. It's currently most active community in #CN and have more than 50 active members even the steem price is so low. For more detail about this community, feel free to check this post: <a href="https://steemit.com/@team-cn/introduction-of-team-cn">Introduction of @team-cn</a>.

<strong>@cn-curation:</strong> This is a CN curation project created by founders of @team-cn(@ericet, @honoru and @softmetal) and @htliao. The purpose of this project is to select 2 most undervalued posts from #cn, summarize it and recommand it to CN members. Each time an article is selected, @team-cn will sponsor the Steem Basic Income (SBI) membership for the author. Since SBI provides life-time upvotes, it encourages the author to keep posting high quality articles.

<strong>@cn-activity:</strong> We are trying hard for our members to stay engaged with others. So @honoru and I decided to create a new project which aims to select some easy contests for members to join. It's been created for 3 weeks and I do see a lot of engagements!

I cannot say my post is top quality but I would say it's made with effort, time, and dedication. For instance, this post <a href="https://steemit.com/@ericet/steemworldorgsbd-e7xtcme8eb">Steemworld.org 回购SBD功能</a>
This post gives you step-by-step guide to explain you how we can convert SBD to STEEM via steemworld.org "Convert SBD" function. This is not the same as the internal market. 
It also explains why it's good to use it (arbitrary opportunity and reduce debt ratio) and what's the risk. 
I spent time to read the steem whitepaper and did some researches to find an alternative way for regular steemians to convert SBD themselves. It's made with effort, time, and dedication.

I have a reputation of 64 and I have more than 4000SP now. Because I have faith in STEEM, so I invest some money every month and powering up.

I'm a very good candidate of this contest. Please thoughtful considering my entry even most of my posts are written in Chinese.
