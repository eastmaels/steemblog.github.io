Hi,I'm David.ho,the nickname  on steemit is:rivalhw,I came the website for about 2 months,in the past days,I wrote blog on it,and I found it's very interesting for me,but,for about 1 week ago,when I went to my parents'home,I found i can not login my account,and when i come back my home,i found it still can not login.
  fortunately,I had login in my office's computer some days ago,so it can  posting now ,now,you can see this ,but when i use the function :Transfer to Account,after i input my password,it display:Missing Active Authority rivalhw.I have try it for many times,all fail.
 I'm sure i never change my password these days,  my friend @laonie and some other friends try to help me ,but it still can not work,now i can login in my account and posting,but can not make transfers and place orders(a week ago I just use it and it can be work fine) ...
