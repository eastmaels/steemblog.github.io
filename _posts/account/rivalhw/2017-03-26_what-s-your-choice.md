I attend a party which talk in English tonight.

　　At the last,we have a debate,two topics. topic 1 is :one person you love her(him),another she(he) love you ,which one is your choice? and,topic 2 is :talking and doing something,which is more important to? you can select topic 1 or topic 2,or both of them above.

　　About topic 1,in my opinion,i think most of people choice the one you love her(him).when i was a younger,i make girl friends,i love someone and do not care who love me or not love me,it's not important for me,i think,as long as  she was not boring me,it's really OK for me indeed.some years later ,when i grow up and became an adult, before  i get married,i prefer to choose someone who love me in deep,why?you know,if you choose one she(he) love you,if you do anything,she(he) will support you to do it,only one you should do is try your best to do yours.

　　And about topic 2,which one you think more important,talking or doing?

　　For example about me before i give my option.about some years ago,i was a programmer,we often said:talking is cheap,show me your code(program code).we all believed,no code,no result,so if then you want to say more thing about it,some one will say,yours code?if you have no code or incomplete code,we do not trust it,and if then you want say anything,your boss will say to you:close your  youth,just do it at now.

　　So,it's obvious to my  option,doing something is more important than talking.

　　What about you,what's your choice?
　　BTW,It's my first to write in English,any mistake can leave  note to me,many thanks to you.
