　　上个世纪八、九十年代，甚至到本世纪初，是电脑时代发展史上的一段辉煌时期，这期间很多早期个人程序开发者粉墨登场，一时间大有百花齐放百家争鸣的景象，这其中不乏我们后来一些耳闻目熟的优秀软件开发者，包括求伯君、王江民、吴晓军、鲍岳桥、周志农、刘旭、朱崇君、王志东、梁肇新等，都是那个年代的佼佼者，可以说那是个英雄辈出的时代。
       There was a boom in the computer industry since the 1980s and 1990s, and  even up to the beginning of this century, many Chinese programmers who  were pioneers at that time, began to flourish in the market. Some of  them are great software developers that we are quite familiar with  today, such as  Bojun Qiu, Jiangmin Wang, Xiaojun Wu, Yueqiao Bao,  Zhinong Zhou, Xu Liu, Chongjun Zhu, Zhidong Wang, Zhaoxin Liang and so  on. They were the top players in their game, and it was an era that many  heroes had emerged.

　　进入二十一世纪后，尤其是近几年来，进入到移动互联网时代，软件开始变得越来越强大，也越来越复杂，同时，因为时代发展的迅猛，和互联网这个行业日新月异的发展，已经很难再像从前，一个人单枪匹马就可以撑起软件一片天了。更因为商业的需要，一款软件通常分工已经非常明确，从项目经理、产品经理、UI设计、前端开发、后端开发、数据库、测试等，如同工厂流水线般，一款软件从立项开始，到最后上市，短则十几天，多则几个月，很快就可以推向市场。。。
    As we marched into the 21st century, especially in recent years, the  growth of mobile internet has propelled softwares to become increasingly  powerful and complex. At the same time, because of the exponential  growth of an ever-changing internet industry, it’s almost impossible to  develop a software alone, unlike the past. Creating a software that can  be commercially successful, it takes a specialised team with multiple  roles to fulfill, such as a Project Manager, Product Manager, User  Interface Designer, Front-end Developer, Backend Developer, Database  Manager, Software Testing Engineer, etc. which is like a production line  in a factory. Sometimes it only takes slightly over 10 days, or a  couple of months at most, for a software to launch in the market from  its incubation.

　　这个时代，已经不再属于从前个人英雄的时代了，虽然到今天，英雄仍有，但影响力也远不如从前。更多的是，我们追求的是分工明确，每个人在团队里努力把自己最优秀的一面发挥出来，大家一起通力，最后合作共赢，皆大欢喜！
    Nowadays, there is little place for lone heros, even though they still  exist, but their  influences have diminished. More often than not, we  look for clearly delegated tasks that bring out the best strength in us,  to achieve a win-win situation through collaboration and teamwork. It’s  a happy ending for all! 

　　联想到steemit中文社区，steemit上有很多帖子，如果硬要归类的话，我大致留意了下，诸如旅游、贴图、技术、美食、虚拟币、幽默等，而像创作类如小说、故事等就很少了。每个人的力量都是有限的，但如果多个人合作起来，兴许可以成就一番大事:)，不要笑，大家可以看，全球华文区最著名的天涯论坛，就是很好的说明，大家会经常看到很优秀的文章贴，多数都是连载系列，非常精彩。
        This reminds me of our Chinese community here on Steemit. There are many  posts on Steemit, to sum it up, they generally fall under these  categories, such as travel, photography, technology, food,  cryptocurrency, humor, etc. However, topics on creative writing, such as  fiction or short stories are not very common. As an individual, our  strength is limited, however, if we work together as a team, something  great could be accomplished. Don’t laugh… take a look at the most famous  Chinese forum on the internet Tianya, it’s an excellent example because  there are so many wonderful posts there, some are released in series,  very interesting.

　　而反观steemit中文区里，本身帖子就少，优秀的帖子通过CN区输出到其它地方就更少了，这大大降低了中文区的影响力，而中文可是世界上最多人用的语言哦:)。我们都知道，中文社区在整个steemit的影响力还是很有限的，这点从中文社区群稀少的人数或者近几天的选举top50见证人投票就足可以看出，整个中文社区里，就abit一人上榜，不能不说是很是尴尬，想起来我办公室江对面那所大名鼎鼎学校里的座右铭:革命尚未成功，同志仍需努力。
       In comparison, the Chinese community on Steemit have published very few  posts so far, the ones with substantial content that could be shared in  other places are even fewer. This really undermines the influence of our  Chinese community, albeit Chinese is the most spoken language in the  world. We know that obviously right now we have very little influence on  Steemit, this is due to the small number of participants, and in the  recent voting for the Top 50 Witnesses, among all of us, only Abit made  it to the list, it is kinda embarrassing. This reminds me of the motto  of the famous school across my office, “The Revolution has not yet succeeded.  Comrades, we must carry on!” 

　　看到最近steemit平台的发展，我有个新的想法，就拿我自己来说，我个人常写些小说、笑话、故事，心得体会，甚至一些我自己感悟到的人生哲理等，虽说道理说起来人人都明白，但以我个人的体会，如果道理是你自己总结出来的，尤其是亲身经历或感悟到的那种道理，你会感受刻骨铭心，以后碰到类似的事情，你自然会想到先前的经验或教训，这个对提高个人的思考力也很大帮助。
         After seeing the recent development of Steemit, i have a new idea. Take  myself as an example, I usually like to write fiction, jokes, stories,  and about my outlook on life (philosophy) that has inspired me along the  way, especially the ones that i have been through personally. Although  we all have common sense, but in my opinion, if we were brought to a  conclusion on our own,  especially through our personal experiences or  enlightenment, it often has a much stronger impact on us. If a similar  scenario should happen again, we would naturally recall the lesson that  we had learned before. This helps us to develop our critical thinking  skills too. 

　　我个人喜欢读书，喜欢交友，喜欢接触新鲜的事物。我在想，也许你擅长摄影，或者绘图，或者音乐，或者书法，或者文字翻译，等等，很多人都有一技之长，既然如此，完全可以把每个人的资源同另外一个人的资源，甚至更多人整合起来，这样你就拥有了更多的发挥，也有了更多的朋友，大家一起交流，一起提高，把更多不同背景、不同声音、好多好玩有趣想法的朋友，都带进社区来，一起大家也都可以收获的更多。。。
       I enjoy reading, making friends, and getting in touch with new things. I  wonder, perhaps you’re good at photography, or drawing, or music, or  calligraphy, or translation and so on, because everyone has his/her own  specialty. Therefore, we shall integrate one’s skillset with the  other’s, and when there are more people together, we could have a bigger  platform to showcase our talent, and make more friends. We could  exchange our perspectives, and improve ourselves. We should also invite  people from different background, people with their own voices and  interesting ideas to join us. We would all be rewarded in a much more  profound way. 

　　我相信，这是一个相互合作才能共赢的时代!
         I believe that collaboration is the key to a win-win situation in our time!
