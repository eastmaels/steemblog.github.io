<p>　　The most famous Transformers in China, are the Hasbro’s 95-episode The Transformers series released here in 1988. Someone would say that there should be 98 episodes in total, but if i’m not mistaken, they only aired 95 episodes back then. Why am i so sure? It’s because i watched the last 2 episodes before my school started, and strangely they never showed the remaining 3... It wasn’t until years later then i came across the full 4 Seasons 98 Episodes of The Transformers box set from a video store, i was ecstatic and immediately purchased them for my personal collection.</p>
<p>　　国内变形金刚最出名的，莫过于88年左右引进的美国孩之宝95集动画片《变形金刚》，也有人说98集，但如果我没记错的话，当年是只引进了前95集，为什么我记忆这么深刻呢？原因是最后两集恰好是我当年开学前看的最后两集，而这之后的三集，就神奇地没有再出现过。直到多年后，我在影像店终于看到全四季98集后，欣喜若狂之后便购买收藏下了。</p>
<p>　　In Hasbro’s original version, actually they have 4 Seasons (98 Episodes) as such:</p>
<p>　　Season 1, originally aired in 1984, episode 1-16;</p>
<p>　　Season 2, originally aired in 1985, episode 17-65;</p>
<p>　　Season 3, originally aired in 1986, episode 66-95;</p>
<p>　　Season 4, originally aired in 1987, episode 96-98.</p>
<p>　　其实那个版本，孩之宝确实是一共出了四季，共98集，分别如下：</p>
<p>　　1984年出品（第一季） 1-16集；1985年出品 （第二季） 17-65集；1986年出品（第三季） &nbsp;66-95集； 1987年出品 （第四季） 96-98集。</p>
<p>　　The story follows Optimus Prime's Autobots and Megatron's Decepticons as they leave their metallic homeworld of Cybertron to search for new sources of energy to revitalize their war efforts, only to crash-land on Earth, where they remain entombed and offline for four million years. There is no doubt that the screenwriter is speaking from the perspective of the Autobots, about how the Decepticons are brutal and evil, and the Autobots are always indomitable in fighting against the dark forces.</p>
<p>　　故事一开始是从几百万年讲起，那时候的赛博特的星球上，已经存在霸天虎和汽车人两派势力。毫无疑问，编剧是站在汽车人角度上，讲霸天虎如何凶残和使坏，而汽车人这方一直是不屈不挠地一直坚持同黑暗势力都争着。</p>
<p>　　Even now i’m still very fond of the Chinese translations, they are so precise and vivid. We used to get very excited or shocked when our familiar characters such as Optimus Prime(擎天柱), Megatron(威震天), Ultra Magnus(通天晓), Bumblebee(大黄蜂), Galvatron(惊破天) and Starscream(红蜘蛛) appear in the show.</p>
<p>　　一直到现在，我非常喜欢大陆对这些故事中人物的翻译，我甚至一度认为这些翻译简直就是神来之笔，比如擎天柱、威震天、通天晓、大黄蜂、惊破天、红蜘蛛等，伴随着这些现在我们耳闻目熟的名称，每一个人物的出场，都是曾经令我们无比的兴奋和震撼。</p>
<p>　　The war between Autobots and Decepticons lasted for eons, and the resources on Cybertron was exhausted. Under the leadership of Optimus Prime, the Autobots left Cybertron on their spaceship Ark to search for new energy in the universe. Megatron took advantage and attacked them immediately afterwards. That battle ended with the combatants crashing on prehistoric Earth and lying catatonic for four million years.</p>
<p>　　汽车人和霸天虎在塞伯坦的战争已经持续了很久，星球资源已经枯竭，汽车人在擎天柱的带领下登上巨型战舰方舟号前往宇宙搜寻新能量，霸天虎首领威震天率领部下乘报应号战舰追击。双方在古老的地球上空交战，霸天虎登陆了方舟，与汽车人在战舰上搏斗。飞船失去控制，坠毁地球，所有变形金刚终止了活动。</p>
<p>　　In 1984, a volcanic eruption jogged Ark’s systems and caused its computer to reactivate. The ship repaired its passengers, Autobot and Decepticon alike, and thus the war spread on Earth. During the war, Autobots establish alliance and friendship with humans, always try to protect the Earth’s resources. However, the Decepticons are constantly destroying them. New members and support are being introduced to both sides in this process. When they regained connection with Cybertron later on, the war expanded to the universe. As the two sides are evenly matched, the war continues.</p>
<p>　　1984年，方舟坠毁地火山爆发，战舰电脑显像一号恢复机能，扫描地球上的物品，重新激活变形金刚。两派的战争又在地球延续，战争中，汽车人与地球人建立了友谊，并竭力保护地球，而霸天虎则不断抢掠能源。双方在战争中不断加入新的力量，后来与塞伯坦恢复了联系，战争又从地球扩展到宇宙，双方势均力敌，战争持续不断。</p>
<p>　　。。。</p>
<p>　　When i was little, I remember wondering who had created the Transformers, since they were so extraordinary? To find out this answer, i kept watching till the end of Season 3, where the answer was revealed.</p>
<p>　　我记得小时候有阵子我很疑惑，既然变形金刚们这么优秀，那么究竟是何人造就出这么伟大的产品？怀着对此一直的探索，在后来的第三季即将结束时，给出了我们答案。</p>
<p>　　It was the demigod Primus who created the Transformers, with the intention that they would all be righteous and obedient. However, some of them began to resist his cruel repression, eventually overturned and banished him from Cybertron. Afterwards, they soon became divided into two main groups, which are the Autobots and Decepticons.</p>
<p>　　变形金刚最早是由五面怪创造出来的奴隶机械人，由于五面怪的残忍镇压，变形金刚中有部分反抗者起来领导大家开始反抗，最终推翻五面怪，并将其赶出塞伯坦。而在赶走五面怪之后，这部分变形金刚分裂成两派，也就是后来我们熟知的霸天虎和汽车人两派。</p>
<p>　　Alpha Trion, one of the oldest living Transformers, was given the Matrix of Leadership by the dying Sentinel Prime, but Alpha Trion himself did not become Autobot leader. It would sit in his possession, unused, until the coming of the next Autobot leader, who turned out to be Optimus Prime.</p>
<p>　　汽车人的鼻祖，也就是前领袖钛师傅，将集合了汽车人象征和大智慧的能源宝交给了下一代继任者，之后其成为汽车人领袖，也就是后来大名鼎鼎的擎天柱。</p>
