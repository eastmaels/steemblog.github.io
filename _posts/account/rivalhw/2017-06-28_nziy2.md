Today, I want to share this content, you may feel more boring,  especially women (there is absolutely no discrimination in the meaning  of women), generally do not like history, but if you patience to read, I  believe you will go How to correctly and objectively view a historical  figure, inspired and thought. 
今天我要分享的这段内容，你可能会感觉比较枯燥，尤其是女性(这里绝没有任何歧视女性的意思)，一般不太喜欢历史，但是如果你耐心读完，相信一定会对你今后去如何正确、客观地看待一个历史人物，有所启发和思考。

Recently read a book, read a section yesterday, is on the historical  figures Yuan Shikai evaluation, with my limited historical knowledge, I  think the evaluation is more objective and fair. 
最近在看一本书，昨天读到一段，是关于历史人物袁世凯的评价，以我有限的历史知识来看，我认为该评价是比较客观和公正的。

Usually the history book is such a description of Yuan:
通常历史书是这样描述袁的：         

First, Yuan Shikai steal the revolutionary fruit. If he did not appear,  Sun Yat-sen and others will be able to successfully establish a  bourgeois democratic republic. 
一、袁世凯窃取了革命果实。如果没有他的出现，孙中山等人一定能顺利建立起一个资产阶级民主共和国。
     
Second, Yuan Shikai character is not kind, is a white face Cao Cao, bullying his widow and orphans, overturned Qing court boat. 
二、袁世凯人品不厚道，乃大白脸曹操，欺他寡妇与孤儿，倾覆清廷社稷。         

Most of the views held by modern people, including our textbooks and  history books are described so. Next we analyze the following: 
以上为现代人持有的多数观点，包括我们的课本和史书上也是这样描述的。接下来我们分析下：

Point one, Yuan Shikai steal the revolutionary fruit;
观点一，袁世凯窃取了革命果实;

"First of all, in China in 1912, only Yuan Shikai a person, have the  real strength and ability to make the" Republic of China "become a  reality, not only the powers to see this, constitutionalists to see  this, Wuchang Xinhai leaders see this, even Sun Yat-sen , Huang Xing,  Wang Ching-wei such revolutionaries are also so to see (no matter how  reluctant the revolutionaries, they must also acknowledge this fact.) Li  Yuanhong called Yuan Shikai is "looking at the Chinese and foreign,  talented people", not all flattery At that time, if the hands of real  power, living in the high position of Yuan Shikai does not come out to  solve the problem of the abdication of the Qing Dynasty, the whole of  China, will be caught in the sea of hard work, is likely to evolve  into the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom since the second national In the case  of words, it will make the country 's strength more and more.
“首先，在1912年的中国，只有袁世凯一个人，才有真正的实力与能力使“中华民国”成为现实，不仅列强这样看，立宪派这样看，武昌的辛亥首义领导人这样看，连孙中山、黄兴、汪精卫这样的革命党人也都这样看（无论革命党人多么不情愿，他们也必须承认这个事实）。黎元洪所称袁世凯是“望重中外、才贯天人”，不全是阿谀客套之语。当时，如果手握实权、身居高位的袁世凯不出来和平解决清廷退位的问题，整个中国，必陷于血海苦战之中，很有可能演变成为继太平天国以来的第二次民族内部大仇杀。那样的话，一定会使国家的元气更加因之凋散不振。”

View two, Yuan Shikai character is not kind, is a white face Cao Cao, bullied his widow and orphans, overturned Qing court boat. 
观点二，袁世凯人品不厚道，乃大白脸曹操，欺他寡妇与孤儿，倾覆清廷社稷。

"For the rule, oppression of China's 260 years of the Qing Dynasty royal  family, Yuan Shikai's actions, can be described as Daren Dade,  extremely good and kind of ability.He not only strive for the Forbidden  City to waste Emperor Pu Yi and his family to live every year also dial a  large sum of money If you do not have the military strongman of Yuan  Shikai, according to the unspoken rules of the Chinese-style dynasty,  these "Jue Luo" who must be destroyed by the nine clan, no re-relics!  (Finally, Pu Yi from the palace Is the "thousands of generals," Feng  Yuxiang, not Yuan Shikai) again, to bloodthirsty, treacherous, tragic  start of the royal family, more than two hundred years, the people knock  on the blood sucking, killing and killing, exhausted and fishing, bad  things to do. But also weak its roots, and finally the Han Chinese  helmets in the forehead rally, restore the Chinese. Fortunately, in the  era of chaos should have Yuan Shikai such a coincidence at the right  time there are carefully prepared political giants, at the critical  moment of history Gave the last key push of the Qing court, to the  expense of bleeding at the expense of the heavy dragon flag. 
“对于统治、压迫中国260多年的清朝皇室，袁世凯的所作所为，可谓大仁大德，极其优厚善待之能事。他不仅争取把紫禁城让废帝溥仪及其家人居住，每年还拨大笔款项优养这些历史废物。如果没有袁世凯这个军事强人，依据中国式王朝更迭的潜规则，这些“觉罗”们，肯定应该被九族诛除，无复孑遗！（最后把溥仪从皇宫中赶走的是“千面将军”冯玉祥，并非袁世凯）再次，以嗜血、奸险、残暴起家的觉罗皇族，两百多年以来，对国人敲髓吸血，屠戮杀害，竭泽而渔，坏事做绝。幸而天道好还，弱其根脉，终使汉人华胄在人头堆中振臂而起，恢复中华。幸亏在本来应该大混乱的时代有袁世凯这样一个在恰当时机有精心准备的政治巨人出现，在历史的关键时刻给予了清廷最后关键的一推，以不流血为代价扯下了那沉甸甸的龙旗。”

I am here to explain these, do not want to go to Yuan Shikai overturned,  in fact, Yuan Shikai before the end of some practices, change the  reunification for the monarchy, which is clearly in vain reverse Even if  the past ten thousand years, but also after all, is stupid and wrong  behavior, stupid is stupid, it will not change with time and change,  this is the fact that no one can change.
我在这里说明这些，并非想去为袁世凯翻案，事实上，袁世凯临终前的一些做法，改共和为帝制，这是明明白白的倒行逆施。即便一万年过去，也还终究是愚蠢和错误的行为，愚蠢终究是愚蠢，不会随着时间的变化而有所改变，这也是任何人都改变不了的事实。
