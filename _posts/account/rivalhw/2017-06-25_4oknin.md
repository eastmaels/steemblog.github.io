<p>　　几天后，UI设计出来了，因为客户比较喜欢国外的一个网站风格，所以在设计前还强调了参考那个澳洲网站的风格。客户有自己心目中的风格喜好，也给出了具体的参考风格，这对我们来说是件好事，因为对设计师来讲，有一定的要求和参考，方便尽快的形成初稿。但如果客户是个甩手掌柜，设计师设计时也会有种老虎吃天、无处下爪的感觉，如果再碰到前期问设计上有什么想法等，客户说什么都没，让你们自行发挥，等到设计初稿出来后，却提出一堆意见，或者找了一帮人发表意见，要知道有句老话众口难调，同样一个设计稿也是没法确保所有人都喜欢，虽说对于设计师来说，修改时不可避免的，但也要尽量避开一些无谓的、浪费时间的情况。</p>
<p>　　A few days later, UI design out, because customers prefer a foreign site style, so before the design also stressed the reference to the Australian website style. Customers have their own style of mind preferences, but also gives a specific reference style, which is a good thing for us, because the designer is concerned, there are certain requirements and reference to facilitate the formation of the first draft as soon as possible. But if the customer is a walk away dispensers, the designer will also design a kind of tiger to eat the day, nowhere the feeling of the next claw, if you encounter the previous design asked what the idea, the customer said nothing, so that you play, Wait until the first draft of the design came out, but put forward a bunch of advice, or find a gang of people to express their views, to know the old saying goes difficult, the same design is also unable to ensure that everyone likes, although for the designer, Inevitably, but also try to avoid some unnecessary, waste of time.</p>
<p>　　这个客户有在国外留学的经历，也许是受欧美那边简约风格的影响，所以在设计元素上，倒没有要求增加太多的内容，因为又有参照风格，设计初稿出来后，客户只是对部分色块、文字大小和部分图背景做了一些补充意见，很快，整个平台的风格基本就确定下来了，而这个时间，也基本在我的项目规划时间范围内。</p>
<p>　　This customer has experience in studying abroad, perhaps by the simple style of Europe and the United States there, so the design elements, it is not required to add too much content, because there are reference style, design draft came out, the customer is only part of Color, text size and part of the background to do some additional views, and soon, the basic style of the platform to determine the basic, and this time, but also in the scope of my project planning time.</p>
<p>　　有了较好的开端，接下来的内页设计，就开始逐步有条不紊地开展了。我将跟客户确认过的产品原型书发回给公司，相关同事便开始按照整体风格要求设计了。因为内页版块较多，加上一些内部的页面，估计下来约有几十个页面需要设计，为了节省时间，给后期多预留些时间，我安排了三个同事设计页面，一个主要负责整体风格把控，另外两个负责具体的页面设计。</p>
<p>　　With a good start, the next page design, began to step by step to carry out. I will confirm with the customer product prototype book back to the company, the relevant colleagues began to design in accordance with the overall style requirements. Because the inside pages more, plus some of the internal pages, it is estimated that about dozens of pages need to design, in order to save time, to the late to set aside some time, I arranged three colleagues design page, a main responsible for the overall Style control, the other two are responsible for the specific page design.</p>
<p>　　作为一个项目管理者，我一直相信，1+1&gt;3，为什么会这样？这个我是有自己的深刻理解的。想多年前，那时候我在一家企业工作，对于工作的进展，我一般是采用分阶段向我的上级进行汇报，而不是等项目快结束时再汇报。工作刚开始，你将总体的计划跟上级讲，让对方知道你的工作即将展开，如果上司没有什么意见，接下来你就可以开始正式展开工作了。我习惯在工作时将工作按阶段划分，当然，每个阶段都是有战略意义的，比如，工作开展到一段告一段落，或者完成了某一阶段性的工作等，在此期间，你都可以跟上司汇报你的工作进展，当然，这里需要注意，这种阶段性工作汇报，不一定每次都需要很正式的场合，比如你可以选在跟上司吃饭的时候，装作不经意间跟对方讲下工作的进展，既将工作讲了，也不至于显得过于严肃，效果也很好。反观，如果一项工作，你从开始到结束，都不跟上司交流，除非你的上司对你绝对信任，多数情况下，这种行为会让上司很是忐忑不安，他不清楚你的工作进展，也担心你把工作搞砸了，所以这时候往往会装作不经意间，假装无意中询问下你的工作进展情况，而这个表象下的潜在意思就再明白不过了：兄弟，你要再不给我较详细的信息，我说不定就要换人了！</p>
<p>　　As a project manager,I have always believed that 1 + 1&gt; 3, why is this so? I have a deep understanding of this. Think of years ago, when I work in a business, for the progress of the work, I generally use the phased to my superiors to report, rather than the end of the project and then report. At the beginning of the work, you will be the overall plan with the superior, let the other side know that your work is about to start, if the boss no comments, then you can start a formal work. I am accustomed to working at work according to the stage, of course, each stage is a strategic significance, for example, the work carried out to a paragraph, or completed a certain stage of work, etc., during which you can With the boss to report the progress of your work, of course, here need to pay attention to this stage of work report, not necessarily every time a very formal occasions, such as you can choose to eat with the boss when the pretend to pretend to talk with the other side Work down For the progress, both the work speak, it does not seem too serious, the effect is also very good. In other words, this behavior will make the boss very disturbed, he is not clear your work progress, if you do not know the work of your work, But also worried that you screwed up the work, so this time will often pretend to pretend to pretend inadvertently asked about the progress of your work, and this appearance under the potential meaning to understand, however: Hey guy, you do not give me More detailed information, I might be necessary to substitutions!</p>
<p>　　一个多月后，包括网站平台、微信版、手机版在内的页面UI全部设计好，并也通过了客户的认可。当然，前边我讲过了，页面的确认，我是按照1+1&gt;3的原则，分批分阶段跟客户展示和修改，而这样做的最大好处是，你不用等设计全部完成后再交给客户验收，万一这期间出了纰漏呢？</p>
<p>　　More than a month later, including the site platform, WeChat version, mobile version, including the page UI all designed, and also through the customer's approval. Of course, the front I said, the page confirmed, I was in accordance with the principle of 1 + 1&gt; 3, in batches with customers to show and modify, and the biggest advantage is that you do not have to wait for all the design and then pay To the customer acceptance, if this period out of the flaw it?</p>
<p>　　设计通过验收后，接下来就到了制作和开发阶段。在正式制作和软件开发前，我已经做了很多工作，如上所讲，因为设计过程中，可以有比较多的碎片化时间，我利用这期间，同对方的技术员做了多次沟通，更因为缺乏基本的文档等，所以这个野花了我很多时间，最后才基本大致理清了数据表关系。 我将准备好的客户缘由的数据结构文档，发给了我们的技术负责人，因为后边的开发工作主要由他来主导，这下，我终于可以暂时舒口气了。</p>
<p>　　Design through the acceptance, the next to the production and development stage. In the formal production and software development, I have done a lot of work, as mentioned above, because the design process, you can have more fragmentation of time, I use this period, with the other technicians to do a number of communication, but also because Lack of basic documents, etc., so the wild flowers I spent a lot of time, and finally basically clear the data table relationship. I will be prepared for the customer reason data structure of the document, sent to our technical person in charge, because the back of the development work mainly by him to lead, which, I can finally temporarily breath.</p>
<p>　　开发工作开始进展的很顺利，但在碰到主要模块设计时，碰到了麻烦，原因不言而喻，还是跟客户先前数据结构的混乱，加上这么多年的数据积累，以及行业的特殊性，我们的同事在此期间花了大量的时间在这些细节核对上，包括对方业务的属性，包括具体到数据字段和类型上，要知道，通常情况下，要么有健全的文档，要么是重新设计数据结构。如果你是从事这一行，就能明白我所说这些的意义了，其中的酸楚，可谓是只有自己才知道。</p>
<p>　　Development work began to progress very smoothly, but in the main module design, encountered trouble, the reason is self-evident, or with the customer before the data structure of the confusion, coupled with so many years of data accumulation, and the industry's particularity, Our colleagues spent a lot of time in these details on the check, including the properties of the other business, including specific data fields and types, to know that, in general, either have a sound document or a redesign of data structure. If you are engaged in this line, you can understand what I mean these, and the sorrow and grief, can only be described as their own.</p>
<p>　　所幸这个艰难的工作，终于完成了，但是接下来，我们碰到了个麻烦事，说具体些，就是搞了个乌龙。 这个事情是这样的，一开始，在支付这里客户没有具体的说明，只是讲合同签订后会提供具体的银行支付接口，而后来客户告诉我们采用标准的银联支付，当时我们也没多想，银联支付接口我们倒是不陌生，算很熟悉了，而等到完成这部分工作，准备测试前，这时候对方告诉我们，是银联的接口，但是不是原先的那套接口。</p>
<p>　　Fortunately, this difficult work, and finally completed, but then, we met a trouble, that specific, is engaged in an oolong. This is the case, the beginning, in the payment here, the customer does not have a specific description, but after the signing of the contract will provide a specific bank payment interface, and then the customer told us to use the standard UnionPay payment, when we did not think, Payment interface, we are no stranger, considered very familiar, and wait until the completion of this part of the work, ready to test before this time the other side told us that the UnionPay interface, but not the original set of interfaces.</p>
<p>　　这下就比较麻烦了。因为我们的对接，不似传统的网站，只是对接几个接口，因为涉及到大宗交易，所以整体坐下来接口大约有几十个，而这个时候，项目的工期已经接近尾声了。</p>
<p>　　This is more trouble. Because of our docking, not like the traditional site, but docking a few interfaces, because it involves a large number of transactions, so the overall sit down about dozens of interfaces, and this time, the project duration is nearing its end.</p>
