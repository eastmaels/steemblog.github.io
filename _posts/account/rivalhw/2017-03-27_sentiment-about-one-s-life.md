In one's life,We have experienced a lot of things,or have meet a lot of people.

   Some people will help you very sincerely,

   Shall we should be thankful to whom we encounterd.

   But...

   Some people just came across your life yet not to help you ,instead, commenting you that; 

   "You're not fit to do this or that , and so on..."

   These kind of people often make you feel in low self-esteem.

   For these kind of people,I just want to say in short ; 

   "Make your self correction first, before you start to comment on other people, than once you are perfect with no flaws, than you can throw your opinions to others, but never bring others self esteem down instead try to make others better them-self. " 

人的一生中，会经历很多事情，见过很多人，有些人会真心的帮助你，遇到这种人，我们应心存感恩，而有些人闯入到你的生活，并不是真心想帮助你，却总是在你跟前讲，你不适合做这个，或者那样做也不适合你，严重地打击甚至摧残你的自尊心！对于这种人，我只想说一个字：滚！如果非得在这个前边加上个修饰的话，那就是，能滚多远，就滚多远。
