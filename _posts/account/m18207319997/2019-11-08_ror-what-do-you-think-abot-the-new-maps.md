ROR昨天晚上，做了较大的更新，新增了地图、怪物和物品。
因为当时收到消息比较晚，没做太深入的研究。
但是凭第一印象，短时间内不会到新地图去发展。

新地图在大地图的西北方向，增加了Pyongyang、Wonsan、Hamhung三个城镇。每个城镇的怪物都是在5级以上。按道理是目前等级较高玩家的升级圣地。

每个城镇都有采集地图和战斗地图，采集地图目前对我吸引力不大，现在只想快速升级。但是三个战斗地图粗略看过之后，觉得都不是升级的好地方。尽管怪物的等级上去了，但是完成任务之后获得的等级并没有增加。

所以近期不打算去新地图开拓。
我还将继续贩卖石块！
元芳怎么看？

ROR made a big update last night, adding maps, monsters and items.
Because I received the news late, I didn't do much research.
However, based on the first impression, the new map will not be worth developing in a short time.

In the northwest direction of the big map, the new map has added three towns, Pyongyang, Wonsan and Hamhung. The monsters in each town are above level 5. It is reasonable to say that it is an upgraded destination for players with higher level.

Every town has a gathering maps and battle maps. The collection of maps is currently not very attractive to me, and now I just want to upgrade quickly. However, after I researched the three battle maps roughly. I do not think they are good places to upgrade. Although the level of the monster has gone up, the experience obtained after completing the mission has not increased.

So I am not going to explore the new maps in the near future.
I will continue to sell stones!
How do you think!?
