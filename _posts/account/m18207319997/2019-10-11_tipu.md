中文区在村长的带领下，掀起了一股召唤神龙@Tipu进行的点赞的热潮。新手村的各种活动都的热身参与，不然不留神就会落下后腿，赶不上时代潮流。

这次召唤TIpu点赞的活动也不例外。
刚开始点完几贴后，分数都是负的，那是因为tipu点了赞，但是帖子的收益还没出来，所以召唤点赞的贡献是负的。等到结算后，分数就升上来了。

自己的帖子收入低，召唤tipu就不能为tipu赚到钱。也不好为朋友点赞，点少了朋友有意见，点多了还是赚不回来。于是我的赞全部按照tipu的要求，点那些最有可能赚钱的贴！

按照这个原则，效果不错，一天下来连升几级，得分排名都进入前五了。还赚了0.7steem.

>How To Curate
If you're on the list above, congratulations! To request @tipU upvote on any post that you feel should be rewarded, simply add a comment with @tipu curate command. You can also write any comment you want and just add the @tipu curate at the end. To nominate other user to become a @tipU curator, leave a comment with @tipu nominate under a post or comment - the user that you are replaying to (post or comment author) will be added to @tipU curators list :) You can also combine both like this: @tipu curate and nominate.
Try to be one of the first to curate good content, especially from authors that haven't been noticed yet. Freel free to browse newest post at https://steemit.com/created and find the gems :) You can also narrow your seach to an area that interests you the most, like https://steemit.com/created/gaming or https://steemit.com/created/photography.
Some tips:
you should focus on new posts
you want to curate posts that you anticipate will have high payouts (valuable posts!)
you don't want to curate posts that already have high payouts and the your curation vote will be one of the last ones
remember about the 5 minute penalty - it's best to curate around 5 minutes mark or a bit earlier if you think the post will get lots of votes from other users
