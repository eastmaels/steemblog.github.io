I want to see how the big whale grows up. Click on his name to go directly to his blog. You can follow him and visit his home at will...

Oh, my god, how did he do it, but his reputation is negative (-8.3). I went to his blog and lapped it. The latest update was three months ago. It seems that he gave up the account.
<blockquote>He moved WordPress's feed to articles directly and then praised himself. Replied to his message and praised himself. Dozens of posts per hour for three months, so he got  30,000+ posts soon!
</blockquote>
For those friends who want to develop in Steem for a long time, it is necessary to be cautious in issuing posts. This friend can also be a bad guide to us.

You can learn the master's writing style through various posts on the list, and you will see your post on this leaderboard one day.

Recommending a post of a new traveler which is also recommended by the list. The bloggers describe the entire tour record in considerable detail, and the details are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. <a href="http://Https://steemit.com/travel/@legalnomad/hiking-in-the-wuyi-mountains-chinese-new-year-part-3">Https://steemit.com/travel/@legalnomad/hiking-in-the-wuyi-mountains-chinese-new-year-part-3</a>

(And this list is only based on data, as long as you meet the conditions on the list, regardless of the quality of your post.I have put a bad post on the list. As a newcomer, I am also trying various functions. I believe that your steem wallet will receive a lot of 0.0001 steem. I transferred 1 steem to one of the accounts and provided a link of my post in the memo. The result is tragedy, this article was upvoted 500+, and unfortunately It was included in @arcange, which means that I can no longer be on the list of newcomers...)<a href="http://Https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@m18207319997/100">Https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@m18207319997/100</a>
