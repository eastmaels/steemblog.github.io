The mercenaries which I had spent months were unable to continue fighting because their lives had expired. Don't know what the players feel like? What do the game developers think?

I have invested more time in ROR. I wanted to continuously upgrade my ordinary mercenaries untill they reached level 10. They will be upgraded to senior mercenaries according to the design of the game developers. However, after I have tried this for a long time, it was found that in the current situation ordinary mercenaries can't be reached level 10 by upgrading.

Normal mercenaries need 7776 experience points to upgrade to level 7, and 16807 experience points to upgrade to level 8. Because my highest mercenary is still only level 7, it is not clear how much experience you need to upgrade to levels 9 and 10, but it is guessed that level 9 requires at least 32,000 and level 10 requires at least 64,000.

At present, the most effective and sustainable upgrade method is to fight with thief at the A basement of BUSAN, and get 21 points of experience per hour. If a player is loyal to ROR and persists in fighting 8 times a day, then he can get 168 experience points per day, only 16800 experience points in 100 days, and can barely reach level 8. However, it is difficult to find that the lifespan of a typical mercenary is less than 100 days, let alone to reach level 10, at least 64,000 experience points are required. In the current maps, it takes 400 days to reach level 10.

If loyal players can upgrade to high-level mercenaries through ordinary mercenaries, either extend the life of the mercenaries or develop efficient maps.

Friends who are still playing, what are you  doing in ROR?
