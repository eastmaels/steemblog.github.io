Support	Escort -Vega Security	2500	10	"Support Cards are launch bonuses that you can trigger during Evacuation.
Escort ships such as Vega Security are assets available during the Evacuation Scene. Vega is made of elite fighter pilots which can survive long when not outnumbered.
After selecting this card when starting a new game, you may decide to call Vega elite squadron for support. They will deploy to your station and defend it to their last breath.
Calling them for assistance will place the card on cooldown for a few hours, more if the squadron gets destroyed. (but the card never gets lost and can be used later)"	
	Escort -Ion Guards	2500	10	"Support Cards are launch bonuses that you can trigger during Evacuation.
Escort ships such as the Ion Guards are assets available during the Evacuation Scene. Ion Guards has capable sturdy frigates to act as shield buffers.
After selecting this card when starting a new game, you may decide to call for Ionguards to warp in. They will deploy to your station and help space defenses withstand the assault. 
Calling them for assistance will place the card on cooldown for a few hours, more if the squadron gets destroyed. (but the card never gets lost and can be used later)"	
	Resource Crates by Tom Settlers	2500	10	"Support Cards are launch bonuses that you can trigger during Evacuation.
Resource crates can be selected as bonuses when starting a new game. They will guarantee that your cargo hold will begin with these resources stored. 
This means less resources to retrieve during evacuation and more time dedicated to passengers and refueling.
Tom Settlers has been accompanying colonization efforts for a long time. Colonization essentials have the basic requirements to settle a few men on almost any planet. Activating the card connects it to your current game, losing evacuation will place it on cooldown."	![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmSyya2UeaKKtGgwtVZUA1FHRRkQpQ61azYq9qpWHPyP1D/image.png)

Contract	Weapon Drops Contract, by Rekatron	1600	40	"This contract from Rekatron Corporation guarantees 10 weapon cards dropped to your account every week, with possible Epic unique weapons. The drops start as soon as the game opens door for the Evacuation scene end April.
Rekatron specializes on 'offensive defense' so you'll find many unique personal weapons. They are ideal for for defending against planetary beasts or a ground attack.
The lifetime contracts are expensive but give unique equipment which cannot be found in boosters or after presale. They are high in demand but in extremely low supply, with only 800 of them available on March 29th (and 800 more released at higher price later)."	
	We are Premium Buddies, by Tom Settlers	1600	40	"This contract from Tom Settlers is extremely important for colonization gameplay as it provides the most essentials (such as a water-hydrogen converter or other niceties of the 24th century).
Alternative equipment can be found in boosters, but Tom Settlers deliveries ensures you always get something to send to the colony you want (or to friends you have, or guildmates in need of equipment).
We believe Tom can make you 'all set' for colonization, stockpiling colonization resources for 'the big day'!
Just like Rekatron Weapon Drops, this is a lifetime contrat, expensive but high in demand. Only 800 of them available on March 29th (and 800 more released at higher price later)."	
	Syndicate Sponsorship	350	80	"The last and most interesting or all contracts, and possibly of the entire alpha collection, is the Syndicate Contract.
Syndicate Contract gives you 3 drops per week with have high chances of being unique epic drops:
- Yakuza ships; hi-tech combat ships adapted to stealthy and deadly combat.
- Syndicate Hackers, who are among the best.
- Implants, Narcotics, Holomovies, Yakuza crew, Geishas, researchers...
- Or the legendary Kumicho, their leader, who will boost all other Syndicate members.
Syndicate sponsorship is in extremely low supply, with only 350 cards on March 29th and 350 more released later."	![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmSUDBmPhEx9mYmz2JYLwRqPUQPygWvYxYgFoqa76NgpuP/image.png)

Sp.crew	Kilbot KB-119, Assassin Android	1000	20	"Robot crew are autonomous, they do not sleep, they do not rebel, and they always obey to the best of their ability.
The 'Kilbot' KB-119 is a 'killer machine,' something you certainly want on your side. You can add it to your crew when starting a new game, replacing a default crew member.
The KB-119 will support your officers in their tasks. In 'Kill mode', KB-119 uses several energy and projectile weapons but is by default on its safer, 'Peace mode'.
Once in a colony, KB-119 can receive three tasks: escort your officers on mission, protect your buildings (or yourself) or be more direct with disobedient members"	
	Galvin-4 Diplomatic Droid	1000	20	"Robot crew are autonomous, they do not sleep, they do not rebel, and they always obey to the best of their ability.
The Galvin-4 Diplomatic Droid sells itself as a must-have. During evacuation, he can assist your Officers or receive orders to 'scan' passengers. Scanning will give you accurate information about thema, allowing you to make better picks.
In colony management, Galvin-4 reveals itself as a critical asset as he can be sent to entertain other citizens, guaranteeing a better morale. The robot is also reputed to be 'quick to fix' if a citizen became angry with it."	![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVkrVeyG3tiV8F4o6gdXDbiYoNwxihVXMN8qZ2Zr2rCLC/image.png)
