Born in Beijing, of Manchu ethnicity（满族，mǎn zú）, Wu Jing was sent to Beijing Shichahai Sports School to learn kung fu at the age of six. Both his father and grandfather were martial artists, and he had the same master（师傅，shī fù） as Jet Li. Wu won first place in a range of national level kung fu competitions（大赛，dà sài） at the junior level.
In 1995, Wu started his acting career in Yuen Woo-ping's action film "Tai Chi II". Since then, he has appeared in numerous martial arts TV series（电视剧，diàn shì jù） and films. In 2008, Wu played the assassin（刺客，cì kè） in the film "The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor," which was his first American film debut. In 2013 and 2017, he directed two action films: "Wolf Warriors" and "Wolf Warriors II."<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmXv9QWiAYiLCSr3sKxVzUJVrgin3ZZWM2CExEo3fd5GUS/sep3.png"><br><table>	<tr>		<img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmRgAoqi4vUVymaro8hXdRraNX6LHkXhMRBZxEo5vVWXDN/ACTIVITYCOUNT.png">	</tr>	<tr>		<div class="text-center"><b>17510</b></div>	</tr></table><table>	<tr>		<img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZ6ZT8VaEpaDzB16qZzK8omffbWUpEpe4BkJkMXmN3xrF/ACTIVITYTYPE.png">	</tr>	<tr>		<div class="text-center"><pre><b>Walking</b></div></pre></div>	</tr></table><div class="text-center"><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNp6YwAm2qwquALZw8PdcovDorwaBSFuxQ38TrYziGT6b/A-20.png"><a href="https://bit.ly/actifit-app"><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQqfpSmcQtfrHAtzfBtVccXwUL9vKNgZJ2j93m8WNjizw/l5.png"></a><a href="https://bit.ly/actifit-ios"><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbWy8KzKT1UvCvznUTaFPw6wBUcyLtBT5XL9wdbB7Hfmn/l6.png"></a></div>
