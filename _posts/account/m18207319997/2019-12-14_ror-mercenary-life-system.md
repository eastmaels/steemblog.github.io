After reflecting the issue of the lifetime of mercenaries, the game developers paid much attention to it, and released a message on December 10 stating that：
We are rechecking the mercenary life system.
Mercenary life systems can be removed or changed to other systems.

Upvote the developer's response first!

Mercenaries have a lifetime, it is the first time that I have encountered  in countless games I played. This idea is very creative. But whether it can be used well depends on the supporting post-development. 

I think this life span is better to keep, after all, it is a very new idea for the game team. I do n’t know if the game player can add a map with relatively high level requirements in the subsequent development. Where the players can get some items that extend the lifetime. For example, after using 10 of the items, mercenary can extend the life by 1 week. Advanced items can extend life for one month after use. If the player does not receive the drug for a long time, the mercenary will naturally expire and die.
