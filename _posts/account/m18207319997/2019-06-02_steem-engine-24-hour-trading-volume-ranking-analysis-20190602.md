Since the focus on steem-engine trading volume, DEC took the first place in the list with $2296 trading volume today, which is $100 more than the second JJM. The SCT, which was hot in the previous period, finished third with $1111. Does it indicate that the era of the Three Kingdoms is coming or the opening of the new hegemonic era? We will wait and see, and the mass base of DEC cannot be ignored. Individuals are still very optimistic about the rise of DEC!
The volume of the last three digits of the 24-hour trading volume list is shrinking. The strong and strong, the weak and weak, will continue for some time.

自关注steem-engine交易量以来，24小时交易量榜单前2位首次出现SCT和JJM以外的新币。今天DEC币首次以$2296的交易量占据榜单第一，比第二位的JJM多出 $100，前段交易火爆的SCT以$1111屈居第三。这是否预示着三国鼎立的时代来临还是新霸主时代的开启，大家拭目以待，但是DEC的群众基础不容忽视，个人还是很看好DEC的崛起！
24小时交易量排行榜后三位的交易量日渐缩小。强者恒强，弱者俞弱的格局还会有一段时间持续。
