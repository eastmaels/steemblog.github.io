<div>How to play the new version of Drugwars?</div>
<div> There are lots of changes between the new version of Drugwarsand the old version from the page display, most of the friends prefer the original old version. The main content update includes the official start of the war and bootcamp units.</div>
<div><center><img class="size-full wp-image-11938 aligncenter" src="http://cnstm.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/2019/03/图标.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></center><br/></div>
<div></div>
<div>Rules of war:</div>
<div></div>
<div>1.  resource :</div>
<div>All resources, including drugs, weapons, andALCOHOLS, will be robbed.The storage is now protecting 25% of your resources. That should make you more comfortable.In result the attackers can steal a maximum of 30% of the 75% which are not safe.</div>
<div></div>
<div>2. Protection mechanism:</div>
<div>After suffering a defeat, a 12 hours shield will be automatically activated, but it will disappeared once you attack another player within the 12 hours. if you are the offensive party, even if you fail in the battle,you can not get the12 hours of protection rights.</div>
<div></div>
<div>3. Bootcamp units:</div>
<div>In the very near future the Army that will leave for the war will be limited to 200 population(200 population rule is not applied yet. You may be attacked with as many units as possible); The bootcamp units and resource requirements have changed; nine new types of combatants have been added, including high-attack and high-defense personnel.</div>
<div></div>
<div><center><img class="size-full wp-image-11943 aligncenter" src="http://cnstm.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/2019/03/2019-03-04_15-34-09.png" alt="" width="712" height="320" /></center><br/></div>
<div></div>
<div>Recent personal game suggestions:</div>
<div></div>
<div>1. Look more and do less.</div>
<div>After all, the war mode has just started, everyone is exploring and growing up in battle. There was once a player who rushed out without knowing his opponent. As a result, the two sides fought hard and ended up with a tragic victory. Sadly, he did not grab any resources and lost nearly 200 steem worth of combatants.</div>
<div></div>
<div>2. Grab the bank to earn steem.</div>
<div>During the period of familiarity with the rules and the stability rules of the game organizers, it is recommended to grab a bank every 4 hours to use the drugs.</div>
<div></div>
<div>3. Recruit combatants.</div>
<div>if you do not want to grab others, it is recommended to use defensive and offensive matches, personal preference for Big mama (high defense) and Bazooka Guy (high attack) 1:3 .</div>
<div><center><img class="size-full wp-image-11941 aligncenter" src="http://cnstm.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/2019/03/Big-mama.jpeg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></center><br/></div>
<div></div>

<div>After guaranteeing your own safety (in your storage there are only 100 drugs to be grabbed,and  you have combatants of equivalent value to 5 steem in defense, others will not risk the 5 steem combatants to grab your 100drugs resources) ,Return to normal construction, and gradually recruit attack and defense high combat units, such as MERCENARY (attack 120, defense 75).</div>
