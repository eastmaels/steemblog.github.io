Hi everyone! These are my picks for the group stage of the @blocktrades World Cup.

If you want to join the Cup, [click here](https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/join-the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-2-000-sbd-in-prizes).

@blocktrades loves to sponsor this type of community engaging projects and @acidyo & @anomadsoul know a lot of Steemians love this game, so we decided to organize this enormous Football World Cup event.

You don´t have to be a professional analyst of the game, your national team doesn´t have to participate, you don´t need to know much about Football to join...

All you need to do is write a post picking every match winner and, the Steemian who makes the most points, wins.

<center> **As simple as that**</center>
