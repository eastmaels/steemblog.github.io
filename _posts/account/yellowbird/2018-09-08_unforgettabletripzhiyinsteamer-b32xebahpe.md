<h3>ZHIYIN STEAMER</h3>

Last year October 15th, I experienced an unforgettable trip—ZHIYIN STEAMER.As night falls, The wind blowed from the river, and the ZHIYIN STEAMER was brightly lit.

Approaching the pier of the steamer, the songs of the Republic of China have been surrounded, and the crossing of one time was about to kick off.

"ZHIYIN STEAMER" was a 1930s-style steamer, Some stories that people meet in a journey happened on the steamer.

There is no fixed auditorium and performance area in the traditional theater. The actors and spectators can move freely in the cabin. In other words, when the whistle sounds, the boat sails out of the river, and every actor in the boat begins to perform, you want to see What to look at, and will also be part of the play, you can interact deeply with the actors.

The stories on each floor of the ship are different, and the seemingly unrelated stories are independent, but they are combined by the “ZHIYIN STEAMER”. The boat is said to be, some story about the rivers, the ship and the city.

We were ready to board the ship.My wife also changed into the cheongsam of the Republic of China.
<h3>BOARDING SHIP</h3>

Before the ship was opened, the stories of different people began to unfold before boarding the ship, telling their own lines.

There were 108 actors, including bankers, singers, students, and social flowers. Their stories haved taken place in every corner of the ship from the moment they boarded the ship.

There were three routes for the entire boarding, and the order of the stories on each line is different. When boarding the ship, I also opened a unique journey through.
<h3>ONE FLOOR DANCE HALL</h3>

The first act was a ballroom. The center was a large dance floor under the spotlight. The actors danced in a ballroom dance, with a monologue of stories and a romantic dialogue between actors.
<h3> ONE FLOOR BAR</h3>

After the first curtain of the ballroom, we moved to the bar. There were people chatting and drinking, there were waiters who helped run the Lee, there were singing singers, and there were many stories. One story is a man who has been on the boat for many years. Every day, he makes a phone call at a fixed position in the bar to find a girl.
<h3>SECONE FLOOR ROOM</h3>

The second floor was mainly a ship's room, with a single room and a bunk bed. Each actor in each room has an independent story, and the story of all rooms is happening at the same time.
<h3>THREE FLOOR ROOM</h3>

On the third floor, each of the original boarding ships also haved its own private room. Each person haved a room number on the ticket. The room below was ours, with some chronological furnishings.

Feel freed to look through the objects in the room but did't take them away. After entering the room, the staff gaved us two postcards and a pen on the table, which could be mailed to your friends. There was still a letter on the table.
<h3>ONE FLOOR DANCE HALL</h3>
<img class="size-large wp-image-23" src="https://ytymhl.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/13-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /><br/>

After the third floor, we returned to the first floor of the ballroom. At this time, you are a boater and you are also a dramatist in the eyes of others. At this time, everyone could move freely in every corner of the cabin, and you could dance with the actors.

The most impressive thing was that a very old foreigner wore a robe in the Republic of China. Several Chinese people accompanied him. A Chinese girl and the old man danced with music on the dance floor. Also with them.

There was also an aunt who was expected to dance in the square. Wearing modern clothes also dances with uncoordinated dance steps. The actors were also among them. It felt like a fighting dance.

At this time, I felt that the actors and each of us were members of this ship. You were also the scenery in the eyes of others. Every boater who bought the tickets is also part of the play, so every time everyone meets "It will be different." Just like this time, I met an old foreigner and met an interesting aunt.
<h3>END</h3>
The whistle sounded, the boat in the monologue was docked, and everyone’s journey was over. Then we wore back to modern times.
