This is a set of photos taken in early 2017 at the mangroves in Sabah. Theme: The house on the mangroves of Sabah Malaysia.

The mangroves in Sabah are like the Mekong River. There are many such houses on the river near the shore, mostly fishermen or restaurants for tourists. The roof of the house has a variety of colors.

For mobile photography, I don’t know much about skills. A little understanding of some composition, in fact, the composition is also followed by the feeling. Therefore, some of my photography is mainly the scenery, the illusory mood, the feelings, and the stories I want to express in the photos.

The sky is getting darker, the sky is covered with dark clouds, and a group of seagulls flying over the roof. The moving seagulls can only capture the blurred shadows, moving and quiet, feeling a bit like the tranquility before the storm.

The sky is darker, and there is some light, reflection of the house...

The sky is completely dark. In the wild mangrove forest, the surrounding area is all dark, but these houses have some light inside. In such a place far away from the hustle and bustle, we can imagine the tourists enjoying the dinner with some weariness.

这是一组2017年年初拍摄的照片，地点是沙巴的红树林。

沙巴的红树林，像极了湄公河。河上靠近岸边有很多这样的房子，大都是一些渔民或者做游客生意的餐馆。房子的屋顶有各种颜色，这个给拍照增加了不少的色彩。

对于手机摄影，几乎不懂技巧。略懂一些构图，其实构图也都是跟着感觉走。所以，我的一些摄影（会拍照也得美其曰摄影），主要是景物、虚无的意境，感觉，以及照片中想表达的故事。 <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://ytymhl.000webhostapp.com/2018/09/house-in-mangrove-photography </em><hr/></center>
