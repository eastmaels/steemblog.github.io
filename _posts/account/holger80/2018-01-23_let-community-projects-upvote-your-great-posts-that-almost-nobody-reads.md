Did you start with high expectations at Steemit and were very disappointed after receiving very few upvotes for your hard work? It does not feel good when your self-vote contributes most to your author payments. Luckily, there are some amazing community projects that are there to help. Requirements are unique and high-quality posts. I want to share them here:

# Minnow Support Project

>The [Minnow Support Project]( http://minnowsupportproject.org)(MSP) is a Witness created community designed to spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, help Steemit grow, and train and retain minnows on the platform.

Go to the [discord channel](https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw) for registration. After writing `$register yoursteemitusername` in the #register channel, you recieve a memo and you have to send 0.001 SBD/STEEM to @msp-reg with your specific memo.
### Benefit
