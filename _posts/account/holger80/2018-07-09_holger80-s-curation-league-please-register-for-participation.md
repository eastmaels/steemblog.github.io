You properly know the [The Curation and Engagement Leagues ](https://steemit.com/engagement/@abh12345/6t6qov-the-curation-and-engagement-leagues-steem-prizes-and-steem-bounty-available) from abh12345. I plan to do something similar with the following differences:
* Programmed voting allowed
* Leasing or powering down/up of Steem Power is allowed

After some feedback, I decided that there will be different classes based on effective SP and used upvote weight. 


I'm using my [python library for steem](https://github.com/holgern/beem) in order to calculate the following quotient:
**collected curation rewards within a week divided by effective Steem Power and multiplied by 1000**

Collected curation rewards are determined by  `curation_reward` virtual account operations.
I will calculate the effective Steem power value for each received curation reward. Therefore, change in effective Steem Power over the week does not matter.

To enter the contest, please write a comment with `add me`. A comment `remove me` will exclude an account from the contest. I will automatically scan the comments for building a participation list.

The following image shows the curation over time for my account:

Can you beat my **2.05 SP per week and 1k Steem power**? If you want to know, then enter the contest by writing a comment with `add me`!

The first contest will start next Sunday/Monday.
