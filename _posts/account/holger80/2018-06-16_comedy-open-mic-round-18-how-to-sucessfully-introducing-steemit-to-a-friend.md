*Sometimes I imagine that I introduce steem to a friend....*

It's evening, I'm in bar with a friend trinking a beer. 
*me*: By the way, do you have a password manager?
*he*: No, why? I'm using always the same password and It is something that I can easily remember.
*me*: Oh, nevermind. How is work going?

*I will try again..*

Now it is launch time and I'm eating a meal together with a colleague. 
*me*: Do you want to earn money by writing blog posts? There is a really awesome site.
*he*: Ok, sound good. How much can I earn?
*me*: In the beginning, not so much. But when you write consistently unique posts with original content, do proper image sourcing, It should be possible to earn 5 $ for each post. Provided, you dedicate at least one hour a day...

*I'm realizing that this is maybe not the best strategy convincing someone*

*me*: Let me start again. You love numbers right and mathematics right?
*he*: You're right.
*me*: On steemit, you have three currencies, STEEM, SBD and VESTS. You can power up and convert STEEM into VESTS also called STEEM POWER. There is an internal market in which you can exchange SBD and STEEM. You have also a reputation score which increases when your posts are upvoted and decreases on downvotes. You have also voting power, which refills every day. When you have enough bandwidth, you can upvote other posts and earn curation rewards. The curation reward amount depends on the time and how many voter were before you. It will be higher when other upvote the post after you. Then after 7 days, you can claim your reward. Awesome right? Of course, you can earn only when you have enough STEEM POWER, which you could earn by writing consistently unique posts with original content, do proper image sourcing and then after some month of hard work ..... 

*Seems, I'm not a sales person...*

Another day, dinner with a friend.
*me*: Hey, you told me that you have some money left, right?
*he*: Yeah...
*me*: I know a really good opportunity. You create an account on steemit.com and buy a lot of STEEM. You are an early adopter, just think of Facebook in 2013.  Addititionally, you can delegate your STEEM POWER to a bid bot, this means guuaranteed ROI for you. In a few years,, you will be rich, without any work!

*he*: Thanks for the advice, I think I will do this...

*There you go*
