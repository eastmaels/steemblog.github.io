Yesterday, I used everipedia.org the first time. My user experience was quite mixed. Luckily, I had an airdrop of 2195 IQ which is currently around 13.7 STEEM, so I could try it for free.

I downloaded Scatter for desktop (https://get-scatter.com/download), installed it and added my EOS key.

The I visited https://everipedia.org/ and could stake my IQ to BRAIN.

When I decide now, not to use everipedia, I can claim my IQ back in 21 days. I used my BRAIN to create and polish an article about Steem and STEEM. Each edit step costs 50 BRAIN (0.3 STEEM). The change is then open for 6 hours and other user with staked BRAIN can vote. (It is also possible to vote for your own changes).

Posts that are currently open for review can be found under: https://everipedia.org/recent-activity/

## Rewards
There are Editor and Curator rewards
![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmRhFabcomfxPgW9rFRGW6w1hFX713MvSn2mffwBNAUoEp)

Editor and Curator rewards are minted separately every period (30 minutes). The formula above shows how the rewards are splitted when more than one editor or curator was active within a period of 30 minutes. 

The rewards are linear spitted depending on how much BRAIN was used for approval. When there were two editors active within 30 minutes the minted IQ is splitted between them. The editor with the higher approval receives linearly more.

The same is done for the curators. In this case rewards are only send when a curator is on the marjority side(when he approves an article when the majority of curators has approved it).

If I'm the only editor or curator within a period than I will receive the complete minted IQ of that period.

## Receiving IQ for editing and curating
It is possible to vote more than once, the used BAIN is summed up. Self-voting is possible.

Let's take a look my first edit attempt on everipedia where I changes something at [Wingware
](https://everipedia.org/AJAX-REQUEST/AJAX_Fetch_Blurb_Compare/QmPr7DARPYfrFa6CzutYsxLJDacAV3X6HXzSp6UUgGgmLp/QmSS3fuX8yM6hP3Ws75jLW6oUEFTBXcVbJGxFiZBdxhYk7/) I made as my first attempt to use everipedia.

I paid 50 BRAIN for editing and received In total 10631 BRAIN of approval which are around 63.8 STEEM.  I received 346.544 IQ, which are 2 STEEM.

The friendly whale innohyun1eos, who approved my article with 10000 BRAIN, received 57.267 IQ (0.34 STEEM).

## Summary for an editor
As a editor, I needed 50 IQ (0.3 STEEM) which are staked for 21 days and I received after 6 hours 346.544 IQ (2 STEEM). Which the rewards, I'm able to edit 6 other posts and hoping for another whale vote.

## Summary for a curator
The friendly whale used 10000 BRAIN (60.4 STEEM) which are staked for 21 days to approve my article. After 6 hours, he received 57.267 IQ (0.34 STEEM). So for staking 60.4 STEEM for 21 days he receives 60.74 STEEM. Thats a gain of 0.563 % for 21 days or 5.67 (9.382 %) STEEM per year.

## Editor rewards without whale vote
I added a product logo and edited the same article a second time. This time, I did not receive a whale approval and earned only 29.719 IQ (0.17 STEEM)

## Reviewing changes from others for earning curation
It is possible to see which articles are open for review and it is also not visible if only one character was changed or a complete new article was written. The diff viewer is also not good.

I changed only the version number of the currently stable python versions in [Python (programming language](https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/Python_%28programming_language%29/), but the diff viewer suggests that I changed the complete article:

![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmZotQkRwLJ3kx2RS6KbpHVZsYwJRkgrrKEKr7d4WWKGwb)

I think it is not possible to review the changes, as they are not shown properly. 

## Summary
The following seems to be the best for maximazing rewards:
* Be active only once in a period (30 minutes) as editor and as a curator 
* If you are a curator, use more BRAIN than all other combined so that you receive most of the curation reward that is minted in that period

Let's check of the whale is following this strategy:

![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmXfQVoKACazvKkqr6Fyo6DTq1wZmecoknDoe7jvTL25JN)

Yes, he does, he curates every 30 minutes... (There is more than one transfer when more than one article was reviewed without a period, so we know that he is reviewing only one article every 30 minutes)

Maybe a good strategy is also to publish a change 30 minutes after the whale curates last time...

No I understand also, why I received less on my second editor attempt, I would received more when I had waited 30 minutes...

It was interesting to explore the reward mechanism of everipedia, but I will keep my focus on the Steem blockchain :).
