I scan every hour the links from https://challonge.com/games/steem-monsters/tournaments to obtain all steem monsters tournament identifiers. When the tournament is still pending, I add it to [beemp.com/sm_tournaments](https://beempy.com/static/sm_tournaments.html). As mentioned, the site is updated every hour.

In order to be listed, just use steem-monsters or steemmonsters as game type in the challonge tournament. The start time is in UTC and the time until the tournaments starts is shown in hours. 

I hope, that this will make it easier to find steemmonster tournaments. Just go to [beemp.com/sm_tournaments](https://beempy.com/static/sm_tournaments.html) and click on a link to check in.
