You can find my last statistics post [here](https://steemit.com/steemmonsters/@holger80/which-splinter-is-the-strongest-one-and-what-are-the-best-counter-splinters). This time, I skip the novice and bronze league as there were to less matches. 

The following data includes only the battles from the last season (start date: 2018-12-11 2:00:00, end date: 2018-12-28 2:00:00). I excluded all matches where the mana cap is not equal the mana sum of the used cards. Thus, matches are counted in which both teams have used the optimal mana sum equal to the mana cap.

| splinter |  name |
| --- | --- | 
| Blue | Water|
| Red | Fire |
| Green | Earth |
| White | Life |
| Black | Death |
| Gold | Dragon |

## Results
The team win ratio shows how often a splinter has won. For matches where both splinter are equal, the winning rate is 100%, e.g. Blue vs Blue has a Blue team win ratio of 100%.

## Conclusion
In this season, the white / life splinter is the weakest one and should be avoided. The gold/dragon splinter is again the strongest one and the black splinter is also stronger than the other splinters. The rebalancing and the new cards improved the Green splinter, but weaken the White Splinter.
