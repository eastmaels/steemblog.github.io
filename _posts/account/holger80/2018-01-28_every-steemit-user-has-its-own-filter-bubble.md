In my first week on steemit, I was checking different tags for finding good content to read. There are posts in different languages, subcategories that are not interesting for me, a lot of spam, and a lot of repetition. When going through the long list of posts, the following thoughts are in my head:
* News are only news for me when reading them the first time,
* I already know the basics of steemit and I bookmarked all imported sites around steemit,
* Sorry, I can only understand German and English,
* At the moment, I don't want to invest my money in new coins / ICO,
* I do not want to read your recipe now,
* Thank you, I'm able to check the price of Steem by myself,
* Cute cat, but too lazy to click on the post link.

So, I built my personal filter bubble on steemit.  I found good authors and followed them. Now, I mainly visit my feed section, when I want to read and upvote something. 

* When an author which I'm following resteems a post of a new steemian,
* When participating in post-promotion in which upvotes of other posts is necessary,
* When I use the search function and found something good,
* When I read curation posts from community projects,
* When checking who my favorite authors are following,
I widen eventually my filter bubble and add a new author to my following list. By the way, by going to https://steemit.com/@user123/feed (replace user123 with any username) the feed of any user on steemit can be viewed.

## Everyone has some kind of filter bubble

I want my posts are read by many steemit user. So I have to intrude into the filter bubble of steemit users. The number of my followers is an important indicator of my progress in this. My followers  expecting from my post that
* they are unique (i cannot write every week an introduction to steemit)
* my opinion on matters keeps consistent
* its topic is somehow connected to previous posts.

At the same time, I'm trying to enter the filter bubble of other steemit users. I'm trying to do this by
* participating in post-promotion channels
* embed always a meaningful image
* participating in community projects with daily curation post that reaches many users.

I'm convinced that consistency and continuous posting of good content is the key to success. There is no shortcut, followers have to be gained starting at zero.

What are your strategies for entering other users filter bubble? Or do you think that there is no filter bubble on steemit?
I really like that the filter bubble is not determined by people that were in my school or university as in facebook. On steemit, I really starting from ground without knowing anyone.
