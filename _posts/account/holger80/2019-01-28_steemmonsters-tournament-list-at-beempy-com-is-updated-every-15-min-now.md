## Tournaments

I improved the steemmonsters tournaments list on [beempy.com](https://beempy.com). Tournaments from fined challonge.com sites are scanned every 15 minutes now. The list can be found here: https://beempy.com/static/sm_tournaments.html

The time when a tournament starts is now shown in minutes / hours /days.

Tournaments with a pending or checkin_in state are shown. The tournaments are received by checking manual set challonge.com user sites. Let me know, If I forgot some challonge user. `https://challonge.com` is added before the following urls:
```
    urls = ["users/smspanish",
            "games/steem-monsters/tournaments",
            "users/bdcommunity",
            "users/travelgirl_",
            "users/carrieallen",
            "users/imperfectone",
            "users/jayplayco",
            "users/clove71",
            "users/theaustrianguy",
            "users/crystalhuman",
            "users/zaxan",
            "users/toocurious",

            "games/steemmonsters/tournaments",
            "https://buildteam.challonge.com/",
