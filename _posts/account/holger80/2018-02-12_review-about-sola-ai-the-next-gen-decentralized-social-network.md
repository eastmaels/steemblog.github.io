They advertise themselves as _next-gen decentralized social network_. But they write in their [Terms of Service](https://sola.ai/docs/terms_of_service.html):
> The Sola project (or Sola), available in the Internet via https://sola.ai/, owned and operated by PLAG Limited, a company incorporated at Drake Chambers, Road town, Tortola, P.O.BOX 3321, British Virgin Islands is a social platform for virtual interaction between users. "Services" refers to your use of Sola project for any purpose whatsoever.

You got banned from sola.ai when ([Terms of Service](https://sola.ai/docs/terms_of_service.html)):

>— Serial Accounts: You may not create multiple accounts for disruptive or abusive purposes or with overlapping use cases. Mass account creation may result in suspension of all related accounts. Please note that any violation of the Sola project rules is cause for permanent suspension of all accounts.
— Targeted Abuse: You may not engage in targeted abuse or harassment. If the reported behavior is one-sided or includes threats it is considered as targeted abuse or harassment.
— Selling Accounts: You may not buy or sell Sola project accounts.
— Malware/Phishing: You may not publish or link to malicious Content intended to damage or disrupt another user’s browser or phone or to compromise a user’s privacy.
— Sensitive Content: You may not use the Sola project to spread sensitive content. Some of the factors that we take into account when determining what content is considered sensitive are:
— Content which includes an excessive consumption of alcohol or illegal substances, or encourages minors to consume alcohol or smoke cigarettes;
— Content which is portraying realistic images of people or animals being killed or maimed, shot, stabbed, tortured or injured, or links to such content;
— Content or comments that depict violence against or abuse of children;
— Content that includes realistic depictions of weapons in such a way as to encourage illegal or reckless use of such weapons;
— Content that present excessively objectionable or crude content;
— Content that promotes or contains pornographic material; this includes sexually explicit or erotic content, icons, titles, comments or descriptions and/or can be deemed as pornographic and/or obscene by the Sola project; the Sola project has a zero-tolerance policy against child sexual abuse imagery.
— Posts and comments may contain or quote-religious text provided the quotes or translations are accurate and not misleading. Commentary should be educational or informative rather than inflammatory;
— Content or comments that contain references or commentary about a religious, cultural or ethnic group that are defamatory, offensive, mean-spirited or likely to expose the targeted group to harm or violence;
— Spam: You may not use the Sola project for the purpose of spamming anyone. The exact definition of “spamming” will evolve as we respond to new tricks and tactics by spammers. Some of the factors that we take into account when determining what conduct is considered to be spamming are:
— If a large number of complaints have been filed against you;
— If you post multiple duplicate updates (text, links, images, videos);
— If you send large numbers of duplicate comments;
— If you repeatedly create false or misleading content;
— If you repeatedly post other users' account information as your own (bio, cards, etc.);
— If you post misleading links (e.g. affiliate links, links to malware/click jacking pages, etc.);
— Creating misleading accounts or account interactions;
— Graphic Content: You may not use pornographic or excessively violent media in your profile image, header image, or background image.

Looks very centralized to me. You can only post, if you allow access to your position. The position is shown for each user.

The [whitepaper](https://sola.foundation/Sola_Whitepaper_V1_EN.pdf) contains nothing substantial regarding the technical background.

## Timeline

## Sola token

* 24hr Volume: 747.580299 SOL / 0.00693672 BTC (https://tidex.com)
* 24hr Volume:0.012 open.BTC / 1,039.243 open.SOL (https://openledger.io)
* 1 SOL - 801 Satoshi


## How does it work
You have Action Points (AP) which refill each day if you login and if you post content which is endorsed by others.
You can use your AP for posting and for endorsing others. You earn also Sola (SOL) when your post is iendorced by others.

Endorsing is like upvote in steemit. By endorsing a post, you are losing 1-100 AP. You can do this, until your AP are zero.
By skipping, the next post is shown. Endorsing and skipping is done by swiping or  pressing a key.

 You can prioritize and hide users.

## What can you earn
Good posts earn around 1000 AP and 9 Sola -> 7000 Satoshi -> 0.6 $, but consists only of one image or a few words.

## What can you do with Sola
Not much at the moment, holding or selling are the only choice.

At the moment, I do not think that sola.ai is a serious competition to steem / steemit. I will take a second look, when their api and blockchain is finished. They working also on a search function and on including topics.

At the moment, there are more user on sola.ai, but the 24 h BTC trading volume of Sola is 260x lower than Steem.

What do you think about https://sola.ai?
