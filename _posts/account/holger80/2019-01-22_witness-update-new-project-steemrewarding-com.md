It's time again for a witness update. My witness server is running strong (only 2 missing blocks for 7 months).

## steemrewarding - a new auto voter (not finished yet)

I rented a new small server and registered https://steemrewarding.com for my newest project. I wrote about it in my last [post](https://steemit.com/steemdev/@holger80/i-m-working-on-an-automatic-steem-voter). I'm developing an auto voter where it will be possible to set the following options:
* include tags
* exclude tags
* minimum word count
* include apps
* exclude apps
* exclude posts with declined payment
* limit votes for an author per day/week
* option to leave a comment after voting
* minimum vote power (vote is paused when below)
* vp based vote (defined author is voted when vote power is above a threshold)
* vote weight can be scaled by current vote power

Stay tuned, this needs some time to develop. I created a new github repo for it: https://github.com/holgern/steemrewarding.

## beem
I'm still working regulary on beem. The newest update can be found here:

## steem basic income
I developed the automation for the @steembasicincome project. The newest update about the developement can be found here:
* https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@holger80/update-for-steem-basic-income-automation-getblog-and-commenthistory-replaced-and-comment-upvoting-enabled

## steem monsters
I added a tournament list which is automatically updated from all challonges.com users (If your tournament is missing, please let me now.) You can find the list here: https://beempy.com/sm_tournaments

I added a ELO ranking of all tournament player here: https://beempy.com/static/sm_ranking.html

## beempy.com
I added a visualization which shows curation performance and votes for the first 30 minutes. Enter a steem url in the form at https://beempy.com or replace steemit by beempy to view the curation of the post.

## steemhistory
I created a small tool for receiving account operation from a steem account. At the moment all written post can be extracted and stored as text file. I'm planing to enhance the tool by receiving also transfers, rewards and delegations, so that it will be useful for a tax declaration. The newest update can be found here:

## Statement regarding #stopthepowerdown
Finally, I want to write something about the newest events altough I'm not a consensus (top 20) witness. 

I will not run a hard fork on my witness server that removes funds from a steem account. 

Besides all the problems, Steemit Inc. had paid and pays for blockchain developers which continuously improving our chain. I prefer that Steemit Inc. keep their funds vested so that projects as utopian-io will further be supported by delegations.
