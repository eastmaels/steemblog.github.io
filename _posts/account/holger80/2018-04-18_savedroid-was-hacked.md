There is no real news at the moment about this. Their facebook page has also no comment about this.

Savedroid was the first German ICO and its goal was to establish a mobile platform on which everyone could automatically 
 invest some money in cryptocurrencies.

In the ICO, around  4 billion token for around 35 to 40 million â‚¬ were sold. Almost all SVD token were already minted and sended to the investors. Only token who were bought by credit card were locked up 180 days. Let's hope for the best.

Edit:
Everything was a big PR!
