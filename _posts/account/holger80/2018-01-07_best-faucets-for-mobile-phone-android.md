I tested several android-apps for easily visiting faucet sites from a mobile phone.
This is the best android app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=earn.cryptocoins

It is really easy to visit all coinpot-faucets using this app. The login informations are saved. You need an coinpot account, which can be registered here https://coinpot.co/. If you do the moon faucet every day, you can double your earnings.
I was able to withdraw 50 Dogecoin until now, as you can see in this screenshot (I converted all BTC, LTC and Dash  to Doge).

The faucethub faucets are to time consumping are not recommened for using with a mobile phone.

ETNFaucet is also a great app for faucet. You can find the app in the play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.etnFaucetApp.starter. It is possible to earn 0.2 - 0.6 ETN every 30 minutes. 
You need an ETN wallet adress (https://my.electroneum.com/).  Minimum withdrawel is 200 ETN (Visit http://www.etnfaucet.com/ for withdrawel).
