Emoji “hotsprings”
#### Components 
At the moment, the Dollar sign ($) is used for three different things. In the Wallet, the $ is used for Steem Dollars and US Dollars.  The third usage is in post-payout and upvote selection for the equivalent value converted into Steem Dollars. Contrary to the wallet, there is no explanation what the $ actually means. Using a different symbol would make the following clearer:
* The shown post payout value is not in US-Dollar
* The shown post payout and upvote value can vary depending on the  Reward Pool

#### Proposal
Replacing the Dollar sign ($) by  by the unicode-sign for hot springs (&#9832;) whenever the estimated sum of STEEM and SBD converted into SBD (value may change depending on the reward pool) are used.

Unicode-sign for hot springs (♨):
* Emoji: `:hotsprings:` 
* Unicode-Number:  `U+2668` 
* HTML-Code: `&#9832; `
* C/C++/Java source code	`"\u2668"`
* Python source code	`u"\u2668"`

#### Mockups / Examples

2 days ago by test(56)  ♨92.16    136 votes

During upvote selection:
41% 0.58♨

#### Benefits
It is then clear that the Post payouts and the upvote value are not in US-$ or Steem Dollars.
