A while ago, I asked in the telegram group of MetaCert, if steemit.com could be included in the list of verified crypto sites.
The CEO Paul Walsh replied that he will take a look. Now the MetaCert Chrome extension turns green when visiting steemit.com.

Here you can see the extension in action:

My advice is that everyone should install Cryptonite by Metacert for being protected against phishing sites!

You can find the extension here:
* [chrome / brave](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptonite-by-metacert/keghdcpemohlojlglbiegihkljkgnige)
* [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cryptonite-by-metacert/)

Metacert plans to use META token as payment for their service in the future. At the moment, the extension is completely free. You will receive also 360 META token as an early user so that you can use the extension for one year for free at least.
