I reorganized my https://beempy.com/steemmonsters site. It shows now the best decks for the different leagues, mana caps and rule sets. 

The ranking of shown decks is calculated by the ELO formula. Each deck gets a unique string which consists of card id and level. E.g. `49-1,48-1,47-1,51-1,52-1,62-1`. All played decks with exactly this card and level combination influence its rating. When the deck wins, it ELO-rating increases and when not then it will decrease.

As player of a league can only play against each other, it is useful to group the deck rating by the different leagues. 

There is now a fast entry point for getting to a specific deck list:

It is possible to switch to a different league:

The list is updated every hour. It contains at the moment all played matches from 2018-12-28 02:00:00 on.

## How to use it?

I start a new ranked game.

I decided that I want to use a Sea Genie, so I press ctrl+F and search for genie:
