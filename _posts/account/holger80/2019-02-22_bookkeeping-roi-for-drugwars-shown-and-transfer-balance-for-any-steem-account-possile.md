The first transfer to drugwars is used for calculating the time duration. The ROI is then calculated by dividing the received STEEM per day  through the amount of spent STEEM. The mean received STEEM per day are also used to calculate when break even is reached (when total is still negative).

## The transfer balance of any steem account can be analyzed

bookkeeping takes now every steem account for analyzing its transfers. A `@` sign must be written before the steem account name.
```
!bookkeeping @steem-account
```
Sent and received transfers are then summed up and will be shown.
