In my last statistic [post](https://steemit.com/steemmonsters/@holger80/is-each-splinter-equally-often-used-in-battle) about steemmonster, I found out that the Green team seems to be weaker than other splinter. Now I created a more detailed view. 

The following data includes only the battles from the ongoing tournament (start date: 2018-11-26 14:00:00). I excluded all matches where the mana cap is not equal the mana sum of the used cards.
Thus, matches are counted in which both teams have used the optimal mana sum equal to the mana cap.

## Results
The team win ratio shows how often a splinter has won. For matches where both splinter are equal, the winning rate is 100%, e.g. Blue vs Blue has a Blue team win ratio of 100%.

## Conclusion
The Blue team (water) is weak against the Red (fire) and the Gold (dragon) team. Blue is weak against the Black team below the Champion league.

The Red team (fire) is weak against the White (life) team. Below the Champion league, the Red team is also weak against the Black (death) and the Gold (dragon) team.

The Green team (earth) is weak against every other splinter.

The White team (life) is weak against the Black (death) and Blue (water) team. Below the Champion league, the White team is also weak against the Gold (dragon) team.

The Black team (death) is weak against the Blue, Red and Gold team.

The Gold team (dragon) is weak against the Red and the White team.

## Summary for Champion league

| splinter | weak against | strong against |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blue | Red, Gold, | Green, White, Black |
| Red | White | Blue, Green, Black, Gold |
| Green | Blue, Red, White, Black, Gold |- |
| White | Blue, Black | Red, Green, Gold |
| Black | Blue, Red, Gold | Green, White |
| Gold | Red, White | Blue, Green, Black |

So it seems that Green/Earth is the weakest splinter and should not be used but for solving a quest. Is could be that Gold in combination with Green is strong. This is something, I will analyze next.
