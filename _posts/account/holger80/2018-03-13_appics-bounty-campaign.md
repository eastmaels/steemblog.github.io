APPICS is a more mainstream version of steemit, which focus on short contents. As there is no flagging, APPICS will have a hard time to fight against image plagiarism. You can see this on sola.ai, many posts contain images from the internet without taken care about any copyright. 

I think that APPICS is good for steemit, as all token in the ICO have to be paid with STEEM. APPICS will also attract more users and will help to increase the visibility of steemit.
