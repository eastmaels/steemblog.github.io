HF20 is scheduled for  Tuesday, September 25, 2018 15:00:00 UTC. A duty of a witness is now to vote for the hardfork by updating to it or to vote against it by not updating to it. I decided to vote for HF20 and updated my witness server to 0.20.0.

I'm exciting for the [several changes](https://github.com/steemit/steem/releases/tag/v0.20.0) that HF20 brings to steem. My top3 changes are:
* Curation "Reverse Auction" Window reduced from 30min to 15min.
* The linear penalty that occurs within the first 30min/15min is not given to the author anymore and is released to the reward pool.
* Resource Credits and voting manabar system

There are also important security fixes and the new account creation system.
