 I found it very interesting that the richest man on earth, who owns a newspaper, has choosen medium for posting details an attampt to blackmail him with nude photos.

You can found his post here:
https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f

medium.com is some kind of centralized and non blockchain version of steem in my eyes. 

The medium.com post itself has a no reach on google. When I search for the import key words:

https://www.google.com/search?q=jeff+bezos+Pecker

I find only news about this post but no direct link to the medium post on 16 pages of search results. This means he chooses medium.com as it has a suffient amount of readers that would discover his post fast enough and would pass the information in the post to the newspapers.

This [stats](https://www.similarweb.com/website/medium.com?competitors=steemit.com) explains why he chose medium and not steem for example :)

Could his post hit trending on steemit.com without paying for bidbots? Or would it be possible that nobody noticed it, as he is a new user without followers. What has to change that someone as Jeff Bezos could just write such an impactful post and it will hit trending? Would he found a fast way to register his username without searching and comparing all the different possiblities to create a new account?

There is also the problem that it is not possible to show the profile username that can differ from the steem account name on the post. His medium user name is jeffreypbezos, but Jeff Bezos is shown on top of the post.

This is maybe something that sould be implemented in steem as well.
