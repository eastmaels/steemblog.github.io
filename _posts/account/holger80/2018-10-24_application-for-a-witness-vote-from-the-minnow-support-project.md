This is my application for a witness vote from the Minnow Support Project ([post](https://steemit.com/minnowsupport/@minnowsupport/minnow-support-project-seeks-witness-applicants)).

I think my main contribution to the Steemit Community is the development of [beem](https://github.com/holgern/beem). beem is a powerful python library to access the steem blockchain. Starting in February 2018, I added 80,000 lines and committed 650 different changes.

beem is almost feature complete and widely used:

[source](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@miniature-tiger/steem-dapps-analysis-september-2018-1540028210530).
beem is currently on the 26. place of all steem dapps.

Currently, I released version 0.20.9 in which I created easy to use executables for windows ([post](https://steemit.com/steemtank/@holger80/beem-version-0-20-8-released-beempy-excecutables-for-windows-available)).

I also write tutorials about how to use beem:
* [How to encrypt and decrypt memos with beem](https://steemit.com/python/@holger80/how-to-encrypt-and-decrypt-memos-with-beem)

I check every day which full nodes are working publish a [post](https://steemit.com/full-nodes/@fullnodeupdate/full-api-node-update---24102018). The information about node state is also written every 3 hours as json_metadata into a account update operation.

As a C/C++ programmer, I have the necessary skills to read the steem C++ code. I try to analyse changes in the source code in my posts:

* [Measuring RC costs for 0.20.6](https://steemit.com/steemdev/@holger80/measuring-rc-costs-for-0-20-6)
* [code review of changes since 0.20.5 - resource delegations pool objects were added](https://steemit.com/witness-category/@holger80/code-review-of-changes-since-0-20-5-resource-pool-delegations-were-added)

____
I created a website https://beempy.com which let steem user see how the RC costs develop over time (https://beempy.com/resource_costs) and what an account can do with the remaining RC:

I'm also developing for steemmonsters: [New features in python steemmonsters added](https://steemit.com/steemmonsters/@holger80/new-features-for-python-steemmonsters-0-0-10-added).

## What are you pledging to do to support the Steemit Community?
I will continue my effort in developing beem and I will further improve [beempy.com](https://beempy.com). I will analyze the steem source code and write about changes. I will use beem, to test new versions of steem in the testnet.

## What are you pledging to do to support the Minnow Community?
By continuously working on beem, minnows can be further supported by great communities as qurator, steemmonsters and others. 

## What are you pledging to do to support the Minnow Support Project?
As mentioned above, by actively developing and maintaining beem, the Minnow Support Project is able to upvote post from registered members.
