Yesterday I found a really great site about learn how to code a ETH-DApp game: https://cryptozombies.io/

You do not need an ETH wallet, just an Email-Adress for registration.
There are 6 Lessons containing several chapters.

Each Lesson consists of new stuff to learn with an example:

Introduction how to pass the test:

A code editor with the progress from the last chapter:

and finally a check answer button:

I'm not finished with all lessons, but I had fun so far. This is a really great experience and helps to understand dapps better.

P.S.:
The solution to this chapter is:
```
    // start here
    struct Zombie {
        string name;
        uint dna;
    }
```
