You properly read about the [DNS hack](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@pandorasbox/myetherwallet-com-hacked-and-currently-unsafe-to-use) of MyEtherwallet.com. A really working phishing protection should warn you now. Although the URL is the same as before, a different content is send to visitors. Cryptonite works and warns its user. 

## How does it work
Cryptonite uses the metacert protocol. Verified safe domains and reported phishing sites will be stored in the blockchain and every user of the protocol will be protected against reported phishing sites. At the moment the metacert protocol is not live, but the extension already works in a centralized way.

You can find the links to the browser extensions here: https://metacertprotocol.com/cryptonite.html.

There is a working product in the crypto world for free? Of course not. It is free until they go live to the Ethereum blockchain. To be protected, you have to pay one META token per day. 
For early user, the first year is free (Airdrop of 360 META token).

There is also a possibility to earn token by submitting and validating links. In the end, every user will be protected in exchange for some work (reporting and checking links). This a really decentralized approach to be protected and protect others.

Why not try it, until now it is free without doing anything or paying in return.
