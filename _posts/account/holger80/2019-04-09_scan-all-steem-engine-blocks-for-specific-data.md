After reading the request of @rolandp ([post](https://steemit.com/steem-engine/@roelandp/scammer-alert-roelandp-666-fake-toshi-selling-fake-btc-coins-111)), I found that a small python script, which is able to scan all blocks from the steem-engine sidechain would be very helpfull.

I'm using my [steemengine](https://github.com/holgern/steemengine) toolbox and will go through all blocks. I will check all `market` contracts with `buy` and `sell` action of the `BTC` token.

I'm only interessted in sold token and not in action in which a order is put on the market. When the order was sucessfully, there are more than one entry in the attached logs. For a successful buy, there are:
* STEEMP transfer to the market
* token transfer from the market to the buyer
* STEEMP trasnfer to the seller

For a successful sell, there are at least:
* token transfer to the market
* STEEMP transfer to the seller
* token transfer to the buyer

For a placed order, there can only be either a successful buy or sell happen. The last placed order determine the type.

In my script, I'm only parsing buy/sell actions that have at least 3 BTC/STEEMP movements.

```
In order to run the script, steemengine must be install by
```
pip install steemengine
```
The script can than be stored as parse_steemengine_blocks.py and run by:
```
python parse_steemengine_blocks.py
```
The tokens for which the buys and sells should be printed, can be specified in this list:
```
scan_token = ['BTC']
```
for example
```
scan_token = ['BTCP', 'LTCP', 'DOGEP', 'BCHP']
```

Here are the results f√ºr the delisted `BTC` token:
