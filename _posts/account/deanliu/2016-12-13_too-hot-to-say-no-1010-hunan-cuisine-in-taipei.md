<p>I hope this dish has got your attention and aroused your appetite. Wanna know more? Or wanna try it? Come with me...&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>1010 Hunan Cuisine</strong></em> is one of our favorite restaurants in town. Hunan cuisine, or aka Xiang cuisine, is one of China's famous eight regional cuisines - famous for its hot spicy flavor, fresh aroma and deep color. This chain restaurant is quite young and hence looks fashionable and trendy, but their food is no less delicious at all! The name of the restaurant contains "<strong>1010</strong>". Anything to do with digital? It turns out yes! They said that <strong>1010 </strong>represents delicious molecules and also it means "ten complete and ten perfect" in Chinese saying which means perfect in every way. Aren't they!?&nbsp;</p>
<p>These photos were taken when we had a dinner in one of their stores in September. Yeah, I save it until today to share with you as I miss it so much. I will show you what dishes we ordered and all their photos but not flavors, sorry! You have to come to Taipei (or you can go to Hunan province too, they have authentic Hunan dishes for sure!). But let's first introduce the almighty FISHHEAD of our first picture! So colorful, so red and green ... so yummy! that's our &nbsp;<strong>#1 Steamed fish head with red &amp; green minced peppers</strong>! They serve this dish with <strong>#2 handmade fish noddles</strong> on the side which you can add them into the fish head dish like this ... oh,... great fish noddles now...&nbsp;</p>

Please have a look at the menu first, dear guests! It is cute and colorful!</p>

<p><strong>大家好！這次帶大家到台北我們最愛的湘菜餐廳「1010湘」來美食導覽一番。大家對於這些菜可能都太熟悉了，我就不像對老外那樣一一介紹了，剁椒魚頭、肥腸干鍋、東安仔雞... 實在要點菜都很難啊！這家餐廳是比較新的，但是這幾年也擴展得很快，估計是裝潢新穎、菜既保留湘菜美味又經過對台灣人口味調整，價格也算合理，自然生意蒸蒸日上了。這些辣菜打包回家，加熱後再加些青菜、麵條等進去，就像是一道新的菜，我們連吃了好幾餐都不厭煩啊！嗯，該找時間再去一趟了！：）</strong></p>
<p>Hope you enjoy this HOT tour! See you next time!!</p>
