Dear Steemians and more importantly fellow Vivos!

I should had done this post two days earlier as Nov 18 is the exact date of my anniversary for becoming **the first bidder** for Viva Crowns' first ever auction ... yeah, the ***Round 1 Batch 1*** for bidding on 
### <center>100 Viva Crowns!! 100!!</center> 
<br>If you were in that epic battle, you would remember it! :)

Very few, if anyone other than William Banks the Viva architect, really knew what Viva Crowns are or even what Viva is. William wrote four posts explaining how Viva works before the auction. Still, I guess not many could really fully digest then ... Here, feeling familiar? :)

[Part 4 : Bootstrapping the VIVA Economy](https://steemit.com/basicincome/@williambanks/introduction-to-viva-part-4-how-do-you-bootstrap-a-new-economy)

Of course, after one whole year, after so many things have happened in the Viva land, after we stay this far with each other, after the number of Vivos exceeds more than a thousand (am I correct on this?) ... many of us have learnt so much more about this system (and I am not sure if I am among them) along the way although there seems to be so much more to learn ... even if we can really all figure out how this mysterious system really works, there are still lessons to be learnt about how to apply Viva to run all kinds of businesses, to help people around you and to make this world a better one free from exploitation.  

I've been thinking about how I should celebrate this during the time that most of us are waiting for the dev team to fix some badass bugs. Today when I re-read the first auction post, I thought why not gather the bidding information about this bidding *war* and make a table so all of us can re-live that moment? That's it! So here is how the first ever auction for Viva Crowns went:

You can see that this war kept warming up until the later stage of escalation led by @wingz's big bid raising it from 3,000 to 5,000! All the bids are listed below in order.

Hehe, see my name at the first place. Yeah, proudly *the first bidder for Crowns* in Viva history!! I know this title may be less well known than @cryptomancer's *the first winner of Crowns* title. But I can't be happier to get this though!

If you take a look closely at those 26 bids (I hope I did not miss any bid among those bidding comments), there are a few interesting facts:

* @cryptomancer is also the bidder with most effective bids (so bid more and you will win!)
* four out of all five one dollar increment bids were made by a single bidder @gavvet. :)
* there were 7 bidders that only bid once, including later crown holders me and @nextgen622. @nextgen622's final snipe almost made it and according to their later comments: if @nextgen622 had a better phone and been away from his son, maybe he could have won the lot as @cryptomancer said that 7,000 was his limit... Well, only God knows. :) I am happy that both of them are my fellow crown holders now...
* also another fellow CH @onceuponatime actually made a higher bid of 6,600, but it was just a little bit late. 

I was the first bidder and at first I was really worried that I would win the lot - not worrying about myself, but worrying that this method did not work and too few people knew about this auction and therefore ruining the team's efforts. Glad it wasn't the case and the game kept rolling after @blocktrades jumped in (but he did not continue to bid... a little bit strange to me though as when I saw his bid I thought '*oh you are interested too? nice! I guess the lot is yours since you have so so so many Steems*'... ha! didn't happen!).

Lucky for me to be able to get a few Crowns in Batch 2 and my Viva journey started from there and keep going until today ... 

#### We are approaching the end of 2017 and I believe 2018 will be Viva's year to shine and we can all start from there and build a better tomorrow with it! Cheers to you all! 

<br>At the end, let's review what our winner @cryptomancer said after he won it:

>Exciting action there at the end. I guess the three of us were just sitting there with fingers at the ready, watching the minutes tick down. It mostly came down to blind luck.

>Ye gods, that was some quick last minute action. My heart was thumping like crazy.
