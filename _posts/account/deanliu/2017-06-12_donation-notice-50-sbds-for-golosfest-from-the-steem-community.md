<p>9 days ago I wrote <a href="https://steemit.com/golos/@deanliu/if-you-can-t-wait-for-steemfest2-in-nov-you-can-join-the-first-golosfest-in-july">a post</a> to inform the Steemit community about her sister site Golos' first GolosFest event coming soon at the end of July (yes like our <a href="https://steemit.com/steemfest/@roelandp/save-the-date-steemfest-2017-creamy-and-delicious-1-2-3-4-5-november-lisbon">SteemFest</a>!) and the latest announcement post from Golos official account is three days ago (check <a href="https://golos.io/ru--golos-fest/@golosevents/ya-idu-na-golos-fest-29-iyulya-2017-goda">here</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of my post, I pledged to help support the GolosFest</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>ALL THE LIQUID REWARDS WILL BE DONATED TO SUPPORT GOLOSFEST!</strong></em>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>So this post is to say that "I have done it!" and hopefully this post can make some more as I have donated more than I had promised!&nbsp;A donation of <strong>50 SBDs</strong>, or <strong>0.03189895 BTC</strong>, or, <strong>$90+ USDs</strong> (utilizing the advantage of SBD currently), has been sent to GolosFest's Bitcoin account <a href="https://blockchain.info/address/3Q72jYiCfVT5gQTUtjgFcCsSMe4NfpG4es">3Q72jYiCfVT5gQTUtjgFcCsSMe4NfpG4es</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, actually the author's liquid reward from this post is <em>37.535 SBDs</em> but I thought I can make it a total of <em>$50 SBDs</em> by writing up this donation notice. Would be nice to help a little bit more! :)</p>

<p>So, that's it! Hope this small amount helps a little bit. And the following is the screenshots of me doing the transfer by @blocktrades ' <a href="https://blocktrades.us/">cryptocurrency exchang service</a>. It is really convenient and no fuss. Highly recommended!&nbsp;</p>
