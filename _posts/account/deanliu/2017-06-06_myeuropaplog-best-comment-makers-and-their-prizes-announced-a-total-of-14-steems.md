[<em>posts afterwards are not included, due to the series is still on going after I returned</em> ... ]</p>
<p>Those who commented might even not be aware that they had participated, or even got chosen today!! This is intended to encourage my followers or my post readers to give me feedback and also, as back then I didn't have time nor the convenience for replying comments, this is to express my apology.</p>
<p>I said so in the post:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Hidden Surprises!</strong> - I will pick <strong>5</strong> to <strong>10</strong> <em>best comments</em> for this entire series and give away prizes of {1 steem, 1 SBD, 2 SBDs} or maybe a grand comment prize up to 5 SBDs if there is one that I consider worthy!! I will pick them after I come back.&nbsp;</blockquote>

<p>However, I left Taiwan with a Steem price of about $0.5-$0.6 and returned to see it goes up to $1 and now even much more!! So I decide to use Steem as prizes and picked up to <strong>10 Winners!!</strong></p>
