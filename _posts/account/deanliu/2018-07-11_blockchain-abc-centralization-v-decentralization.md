# Centralization

<h4>
- where everyone receives commands from the leader to perform individual tasks arranged by the authority. 
- It's efficient. It looks powerful. But it fails to utilize the information and the creativity inside this system of people and only requires versatile human beings to act like stupid monotonic machines...
</h4>

# Decentralization

<h4>
- looks messy, chaotic and random, but it gets the job done as well
- everyone acts according to his/her own will and under some loose rules like "do not hinder others", the system miraculously performs well
- no leader needed and everyone feels free and hence becomes responsible in the long run.

</h4>
