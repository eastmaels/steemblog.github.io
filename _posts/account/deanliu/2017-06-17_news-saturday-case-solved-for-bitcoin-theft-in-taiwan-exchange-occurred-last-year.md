<p>It's Saturday here in Taipei so sharing a local news about bitcoin theft with you. <strong>2,400</strong> bitcoins were involved! (more than twice the amount of <a href="https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@deanliu/being-rich-for-1-second-you-can-do-it-too-on-poloniex-i-did-i-have-sorry-had-997-bitcoins">the wealth of a dreamer.</a>.. )</p>
<p>There seem to be no English news on this event so I will translate it in a shorter version and quote some Chinese paragraphs in the following.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em><strong>[Bitoex's $200M TWD bitcoin theft solved and the suspect Huang was almost taken into custody] </strong></em>(<em>@deanliu translated</em>)</h2>
<p>One of Taiwan's leading bitcoin exchange <a href="https://www.bitoex.com/">Bitoex</a> was hacked and lost 2,4oo bitcoins in June last year. The company had emphasized that all its client's rights and assets would not be affected and they have been cooperating with Taiwan's Investigation Bureau to trace the hacker.</p>
<p>After investigation, the Bureau's team traced the hacker's IP sources, from Ukraine, US, France and finally to a pharmaceutical factory in Taichung, Taiwan. The hacker issued several DDoS attacks through Tor (The Onion Router) from a dozen of sources across the globe including US, France, Ukraine, Hungry, New Zealand and etc, and broke with violence into the accounts of Bitoex's staffs.</p>
<p>After the hacker got ahold of the accounts and passwords, he couldn't transfer out the bitcoins yet until the company had put bitcoins up to the exchange for transactions. He had managed to steal 2,400 bitcoins worth 50 million Taiwan dollars at that time, which is worth more than 200 millions now. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The owner Lin and an engineer Huang of the pharmaceutical factory were suspected to be involved with this attack but both has denied the accusation. The Bureau has found many records of attack on Bitoex in Huang's personal computer and phone, along with his several bitcoin wallets in the UK, France and Russia. The Bureau applied to the court for taking him into custody but Huang was released and now the case is under the judicial procedure now.</p>

<h2><strong>[科技公司爆比特幣遭竊！損失2億 台中1工程師涉案差點收押</strong>]&nbsp;</h2>
<blockquote>2016年7月時，調查局接獲弘科科技（BitoEX）檢舉，指出自家公司的比特幣被駭客攻擊，遭竊2千多枚，BitoEX當時有妥善處理，讓客戶權益不受損害。不過調查局偵查駭客的攻擊來源，從烏克蘭、美國、法國等國家的IP，最後確認駭客的位置來自於台中1間試劑公司，16日上午將黃姓工程師聲押禁見，晚間台北地院將他飭回。</blockquote>
<blockquote>事發當時，BitoEX發現公司的比特幣交易量異常，將比特幣放上交易所準備交易時就會被匯出，所以懷疑遭到駭客在交易平台的後台操控，便向調查局檢舉。</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>調查局當時趕緊啟動「數位蒐證機制」，發現駭客利用暗網的「洋蔥路由器」，從美國、法國、烏克蘭、紐西蘭、匈牙利等10幾個國家發動DDOS（阻斷服務）攻擊，以暴力破解的方式入侵竊取內部員工的帳號、密碼。</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>駭客在取得帳號、密碼後，還無法立即將比特幣轉出，只能趁BitoEX將比特幣放上交易所時，才將比特幣轉出，前後共轉出2400枚，<strong>當時1枚比特幣相當於台幣2萬多元估計共損失5千餘萬，以近來比特幣飆漲的市值估算，BitoEX共損失近2億。</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>調查局的資通安全處以及新北市調處利用逆向追蹤的方式，追查出攻擊源的IP來自於台中1間試劑公司，懷疑該公司的黃姓工程師疑似涉案，並將該公司林姓負責人、黃姓工程師約談到案，2人都否認有犯案只說公司遭駭客作為跳板去攻擊。</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>不過調查局在黃姓工程師的電腦、手機裡發現許多攻擊BitoEX的紀錄，同時也找到黃姓工程師在英國、法國、俄國等國開設的比特幣錢包</strong>，15日時前往黃姓工程師家中搜索認為黃姓工程師涉嫌重大，16日向台北地院聲請羈押。</blockquote>
<blockquote>法官認為目前證據雖然顯示黃姓工程師涉嫌重大，不過卻難以認定黃姓工程師有滅證之虞，羈押庭後裁定飭回。</blockquote>
