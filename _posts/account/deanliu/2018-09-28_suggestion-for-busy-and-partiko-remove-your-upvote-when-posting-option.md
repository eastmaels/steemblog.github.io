The RC problem seizes everyone's attention for this hardfork, but there are other aspects that need our attention ... not on the chain, but on UIs.

As most of you know, that this [hardfork](https://steemit.com/steem/@steemitblog/steem-velocity-hardfork-hardfork-20) has changed the rule about where the penalty-reward for early voting goes, making it meaningless to upvote your own post when you submit (time 0) unless you wish to donate to the platform while you post.

So, for Steem UIs, adding a check-box for self-voting on the submission page is no longer a *convenient service* to their clients, rather it is now *detrimental* (albeit not significant for most) to authors if they keep this old habit without changing the setting (that I will suggest to remove).

I have checked all three UIs that I use frequently: **Steemit.com**, **Busy.org** and the **Partiko** App.

I am very pleased to see that Steemit has removed this almost right after the HF (I suppose), but Busy and Partiko have both yet to make the change.

Despite my awareness, my old habit got the better of me and I have made at least 3 self-votes while I post on both UIs...  

It's really not a big deal, but since it's a redundant function that does not bring value to your clients, I suggest @busy and @partiko can check again and remove those button/box asap for their clients as soon as you can.

**This one is busy's check box...**

**This one is Partiko's**

Last, I am not sure if this suggestion is not practical, maybe it may cost too much resource for the UI etc.. But let's hear it...

### Is it possible to *keep* these self-voting options but make the voting time 15 mins later?
