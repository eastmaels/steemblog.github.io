<p>Today marks the day when my SP level exceeds <strong>10,000</strong>. Normally, people celebrate about it or even do nothing as it is only numbers. I thought about how I should deal with it and decided that I would like to convey a message to the community about how I will stick with Steemit no matter how the future is gonna unfold. Don't wanna go lengthy about it so I will try to express it in a poem style and a few words later to explain.</p>
<h2>3 ... 2 ... 1 ... <br>
From Three Steems to 'Wan' SPs and to the unknown future</h2>
<blockquote>Three is the number of Steems I was given when registered on July 14<br>
From then to now it has been one hell of a 4-month ride that I cannot express fully in even a hundred posts<br>
"Wan" is the number of SPs this account has just achieved, witnessing this surreal journey in the digital world</blockquote>
<blockquote>From three to wan I has transformed from an accidental passer-by into a new citizen of the crypo-universe<br>
From three to wan this amazing place evolves from <em><strong>the </strong></em>platform to <em><strong>their </strong></em>platform and from today on to <em><strong>our </strong></em>platform</blockquote>
<blockquote>I was a blogger that has not blogged enough<br>
I was a talker but I has not shared enough<br>
I was an investor that has poured in my passion and pin money<br>
I was a learner that learnt the fact that there is still so much to learn<br>
I was a dreamer that for the first time experienced the phrase - only imagination is the limitation</blockquote>
<blockquote>These do not matter anymore<br>
From today on it is a brand new start to me again and I will just describe myself to be a ... <strong>Steemian</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>I am not here to speculate<br>
I am here to see spectacular<br>
I am not here to invest<br>
I am here to get involved<br>
I am not here to mock<br>
I am here to make&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>I hereby solemnly declare that this @deanliu account will always hold above 10,000 SPs<br>
Forever until the blockchain of Steem shall ever cease to exist</strong></blockquote>
<p><em>Phew</em>~~~ Did I get too serious!? :-) &nbsp;Relax... I <em>am </em>serious but it is really no big deal <em>if </em>you truly believe in it. So, just another day to Steemit and just another post to boost my SPs ... Have a nice day!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, 'Wan' (萬) means the number of 10,000 in Chinese. And in the following I am gonna talk to my dear cn community in Chinese.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,&nbsp;</p>

<h2>見證過萬一刻</h2>
<p>朋友們大家好啊，今天是在下SP過萬的日子，新規則下要上10萬恐怕是如登天般困難，所以過萬總還是個值得見證的時刻。我先說說結論吧：</p>
<p><strong>我決定從今天起這帳戶將持續持有上萬SP，直到永遠，除非哪天Steem區塊鏈不再存在。</strong></p>
<p>老實說，這一宣示其實也不用看得太嚴重，說得浪漫點，就是與你共存亡，說得市儈點，就是賭徒性格的死多頭，不到黃河心不死。只是希望能夠跟新來的朋友傳遞一點信心，或許讓小魚兒們能夠多一點持續往上游的動力，那也算是對社區的一點點貢獻吧。</p>
<p>遙想當年(其實只有4個月)，從意外偶然的註冊擁有3顆Steem開始，嘗試性的亂寫，有目的的亂寫，高興的、傷心的、文青的、分享的、無聊的各種書寫，寫到了今天還不停；100、200、1000顆Steem的投機與投資，虧損到了今天罵不完；一個、兩個到許多個的新舊朋友們，在全球各地，但尋人啟事發不完... 真的要說的話，故事說不完，就先不說了。</p>
<p>無論如何，跌跌撞撞，總算來到「萬」點大關。cn區上萬的朋友也不算少，但是一路半寫半投資上來的，我大概算第一個吧（好幾位是直接投資上萬的；甜心應該沒有投資，很快破萬，傑出寫手代表；下一 個看好大西瓜上萬囉！）。新的大叉子要來了，要上看10萬幾乎對於一般人（包括我）是不可能，所以，未來朋友努力目標，可能就是以百、千、萬，為階段性目標了。有幸現在先到達萬點，雖然市值，嘿嘿 ... ，但是畢竟「萬」字在中文裡還是有豐碩的意涵，就做了這一個決定（所以超過萬部份我還是會power down的），希望可以 ...</p>
<p>留下一盞「<strong>永遠在萬點等你</strong>」的燈，上來吧，我會一直在這裡等著你！</p>
