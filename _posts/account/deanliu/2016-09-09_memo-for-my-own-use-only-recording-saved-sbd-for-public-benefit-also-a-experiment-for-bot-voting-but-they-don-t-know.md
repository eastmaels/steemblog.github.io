<p>This is a memo (as we are not given a memo function). Upvotes not suggested for normal humans!!</p>
<p>Recording what I have promised regarding SBDs used for public good or charity. I know it's all on blockchain - just like what my wife told me when asking me to get my kid's underpants with Thomas the engine train from the closet - I know it's there but I just cannot find it!!!</p>
<p>Ok. So far on Steemit. My promises in this regard are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>$20 for cn community promised</strong> - pending</li>

<h3><strong>SUMMARY</strong>. $50 for cn; $55 for kids; $10 for tw aboriginal .... on waiting list. OK.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>......&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What's the experiment then?</strong> Well, as human probably won't vote on this one. I have always been curious how many bot votes I will get so this is also an opportunity for me to satisfy my curiosity. Use only the tag memo. Let's see.</p>
<p>** This is an editing after 2 weeks... Just to make sure that we now can edit older posts... but not for posts older than one month...&nbsp;(updated on Sep 23) **</p>
