<blockquote>Daniel Larimer, the founder and lead developer behind the blockchain-based social media platform, Steemit, announced his resignation on Wednesday, <em>“I will not be posting or voting any more. I wish you all the best.,”</em> he said.<br>

The only thing I can do is to leave a comment to update the readers with <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@ned/my-announcement-march-15-2017">Ned's announcement</a> and say</p>
<blockquote><strong>We will be fine and Steem will be up again.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote>
<p>Because that's what I believe, after countless low tides with my friends here. I mean you, the one reading so far. :)</p>
