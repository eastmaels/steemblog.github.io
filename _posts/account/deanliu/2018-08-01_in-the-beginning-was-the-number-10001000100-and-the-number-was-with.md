Yes, I invite you all to venture a guess about what this number is about

<center><h3>10001000100</h3></center>

and also about what is the *word* at the end of the sentence in the title.

If you would like some hint, think about what this sentence originally means and apply it to .... yes, of course, our Steem.

I will reveal the answers after this picture, so **do not** scroll down if you would like to try to answer that by yourself!

First of all, this number is in **binary** - a little trick to confuse you, but the result looks so beautiful isn't it? ^^

So, the number in decimal actually is **1092**. What about 1092?

If you are as obsessed as I am about Steem's history, you should have tried to look up the history of blocks by using steemd.com. Let me take you to the genesis block of Steem:

Wow! there is a **cake**! haha, I think that's the humor from steemd developers. But, well, besides the cake, there is actually **no transaction at all** in this block.

Actually, if you keep searching, there isn't any transaction in these earliest Steem blockchain blocks until.... Yes! 

<center><h4>The #1092 block!</h4></center>

There are **four transactions** included in this first non-empty block which are all **pow transactions** (I hope you are aware that in Steem blockchain's early days we had POW as consensus mechanism in addition to dPOS). The first three players that jumped onto the Steem stage are @admin, @dark and @nxt1 - they both found 1-2 pows that grant them the right to be the **block producer** that produced the subsequent block and earned the associated block reward. 

In this case, @dark became the block producer of #1093 (https://steemd.com/b/1093) and earned 1 VESTS as reward and in this 2nd non-empty block, more miners appeared and earned their rights to be the next block producers...

<center><h4>And the block sequence goes on.... until today</h4></center>

Okay! I hope you have already got the answers! So, officially they are ...

<center><h4>In the beginning was the number 1092 (0b10001000100) and the number was with pow.</h4></center>

I hope you enjoy this interesting and simple looking back in Steem's history. ^_^
