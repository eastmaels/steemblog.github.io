Love Bangkok. People, food, culture, massage... all good. Traffic is not good though...

It was about 6 years ago. I was still young, relatively... :(

Let's dive into it.

Tuk-tuk!! Yeah! Great stuff! (this one isn't typical though... should be a shuttle tuk-tuk for MBK)

Oh, no. Mango... Mango rice, love of my life... Miss it.... :(

Very stylish MRT door.

A swiss(?) cheese hot pot! very interesting for us. Not sure if it is still there after all these years.

Thai food!!! sour and spicy and yum!!! I love all dishes! Gosh I must be Thai in my previous life...

Colorful. Another trait for Thailand. Even the cars are so colorful.

People are angry! Protest! Yet... still very Thai. They seemed so happy that did not feel like they were angry about something... Cute.

People rules!!!

Have a sip in a hotel high floor bar. Call it a night. A night in Bangkok six years ago. (before I met Steem)

Okay, fine. You SteemFesters are allowed to enjoy your Bangkok now. Have fun!

本文回顧6年前去曼谷的回憶照片.... 跟SF4較勁一下.... ^_^
