<p>Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall is a national monument, landmark and tourist attraction in Taipei. It is located in Zhongzheng District, within walking distance to the Boai Special Zone where the Presidential Office is situated. The monument, surrounded by a park, stands at the east end of Liberty Square. The structure is framed on the north and south by the National Theater and National Concert Hall.</p>
<p>I went there quite often, mostly for walking my kid and sometimes just passing by. These two sets of photos were taken on two different dates and one being during the daytime one being at night. My old phone has tried its best so any criticism will be mine. :)</p>
<p>中正紀念堂我不用多介紹了，老蔣是兩岸名人，功過不論，這以他為紀念的一大塊公園，可是台北少數是也可以如此開闊的地方。我們偶而都會到這裡讓小孩消耗體力四處跑，偶而也會路過。這次照片是從兩次，一次夜晚，一次白天，經過時所拍攝。效果還是不錯的，是我這老手機的搏命演出了！下次到台北，來這裡蹓蹓吧！：）</p>
