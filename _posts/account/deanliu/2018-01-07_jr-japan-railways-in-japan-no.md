So many cute high speed trains painted on the entrances of subway stations ... A total of three different trains ... Lovely ...

It must be the famous Japan Railways (JR) collaborating with the subway companies to promote traveling by trains inside Japan right? The question is which city it is that JR wishes to promote its services?

Let's take a look at more photos ...

hmmm,... We can only make sure that this JR is [JR East](https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/), one of the seven JR companies inside the big [JR Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Railways_Group). The one that has full private ownership and makes money! Yeah, it covers the great Tokyo area. So I am familiar with it... JR also runs subways. So if you go to Japan, basically it is hard to avoid using their services. 

Oh, I miss the Japan traveling memories ... Hold on, we are in the middle of something here alright?

Hmm... It is weird that JR East would collaborate with other subway companies as themselves run subways ...  

Unless ... **this is not Japan**!! Here you go! See the Chinese characters!?

Ok! This is Taipei city. Yeah, where I live. We saw this cute advertisement weeks ago and still see them last week. Obviously JR East is doing promotions in Taiwan. Indeed, Taiwan is like the 3rd or 4th (?) largest source of foreign tourists to Japan! Yeah, we just like to go to Japan. Besides, recently the Japanese Yen is depreciating against Taiwan dollars ... Good news! Hope them can last, so when I put forth my travel plan for March this year, I can still enjoy it and ... yeah, go there and take JR again! ^_^

Here is a news in Chinese reporting this:
