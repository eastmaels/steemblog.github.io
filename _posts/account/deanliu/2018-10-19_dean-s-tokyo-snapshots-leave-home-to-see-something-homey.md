From this trip to Tokyo, so far we have found out a difference as compared to our previous trip here .... we have seen so many stores selling Taiwan style food or services or some stores that *are* from Taiwan and doing business here. Meanwhile, yesterday we saw the news that prominent Taiwanese bookstore chain **Eslite**(Ë™†ÂìÅÊõ∏Â∫ó) is planning to expand into Japan... wow! courageous...

It felt so weird to see our famous Taiwan railway ricebox here... at triple price though... ^^

So many familiar dishes... really weird.... I definitely wouldn't go to this restaurant! lol

If you are expecting me to say that I miss home already, then.... NO! I am not done with Japan yet! Don't wanna go back just yet! 

Don't let me see anything related to Taiwan again okay!? I am out~~~~~

*this **Dean's Tokyo Snapshots** series ( #dean-tokyo as a specific tag) is my photographic diary for my family trip to Tokyo. Due to busy schedule and a naughty boy with us, I won't be able to write much but I will make sure that every photo that I choose means something, at least to me... I hope you enjoy this photo series as well as me! Feel free to comment but I probably won't have much time making replies often. Apologies first. :p*

***follow me @deanliu if you haven't! or not, if this does not interest you...^^***
