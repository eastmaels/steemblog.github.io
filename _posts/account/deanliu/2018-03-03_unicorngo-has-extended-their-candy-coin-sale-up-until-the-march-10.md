News Source - [here](https://medium.com/@agentsmith_30065/hi-everybody-abdada12612e?source=linkShare-9818d7f2ae23-1520000961).

Three months ago, I made a [MEME about CryptoKittes](https://steemit.com/ethereum/@deanliu/meme-why-our-3-seconds-confirmation-blockchain-does-not-have-cryptopets) to complain the Ethereum blockchain.

At the end, I still don't have one kitty at all. I don't know if it's easier now but I have lost the enthusiasm. 

A while ago, I was told that there is another cryptopet game coming named UnicornGO, so I checked it out and decided to invest a little bit so I can have one ***Unicorn***. Although when I invested, the price had become less favorable. Anyway, I just want one. 

I do not want to endorse the project nor do I want to encourage you to do the same. But if you are willing to take your risk to get a chance to own a cryptopet firsthand, you are welcome to use my ref link here (thank you!):

According to their claims, the app is coming out soon. You may join their [telegram channel](https://t.me/unicorn_go) to get updates. 

I am not a responsible investor as I invested without fully understand what I would get. So I will just let you know that I invested 1 ETH, and I get roughly 1,000 ***Candies*** (their tokens), 1 ***Unicorn***, 1 ***Land*** and 1 ***Candy Seed***. I seemed to remember that I have read the WP, but still I am not sure how all these work. It's possible that we have to wait until the App is out to understand how.
