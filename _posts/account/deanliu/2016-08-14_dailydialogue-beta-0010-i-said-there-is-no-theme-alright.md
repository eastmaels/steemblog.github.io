<p>Hello again and thank you for following my dialogue again Check the <a href="https://steemit.com/dailydialogue/@deanliu/dailydialogue-beta-0001-keeping-track-of-my-crypto-new-life">first one here</a>. This beta version is a experimental post series that hopefully will lead to a future official DailyDialogue by me. The DailyDialogue is meant to keep track of what I thought, learnt, or even wondered in a personal way without obvious themes so I get to share many random things in my head and also document my crypto-growth every step of the way. So it is even more free style in this beta phase. Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>Picture of the Day </strong>- Riding and Running into a bright futue of Individual Era!!</p>

<p><strong>Something New at Steemit</strong></p>
<p>Just found out something changed slightly when you search for tags. You should already know how to look for tags... like this</p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/14/2016-08-142.52.08e7f81.png</p>
<p>At the end of it you can see now there are <strong>show more topics</strong> available now</p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/14/2016-08-142.52.333ad02.png</p>
<p>Click it and you shall see the list of different tags and replies and payout amount in a given period of time (I suppose so as there is no explanation). So now you get to know which tag is more popular and earns more if that's what you are looking for.</p>

<p>Obviously <strong>steemit</strong> is the most active tag. And <strong>life</strong>, <strong>photography</strong> and etc are also popular soft topics at Steemit (a reflection of whales' preferences perhaps?). The most inactive tag shown is <strong>marketcap</strong> with 2 replies and our familiar <strong>0.00</strong> friend payout. Browse through the tags, there is a lot of information in it. A secret to you is that there is a hidden tag called <strong>NSFW</strong> which is sometimes very hot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A piece of advice from me. Use the tags wisely (see @berniesanders on <a href="https://steemit.com/stopusinghashtagsteemit/@berniesanders/please-stop-using-steemit-just-to-promote-posts">steemit tag abuse</a>). Do not abuse them or it may harm somehow. See? I use only one tag here and it is used only by me so far.</p>
<p>In addition, an even smaller change: we no longer have "pending payout" but now "potential payout" (as this amount might go down before confirmation). It is very subtle but yet signaling that the dev team is improving everyday!</p>
<p><strong>Weekend Greetings</strong> - Flowers flourish in my backward... (I have quite a few photography posts if you like good photos too, check my blog @deanliu )</p>

<p>Oh, I almost forgot to clarify a question you may have. the "#0010" used in the title is not a typo, but is out of deliberation. <strong>It is BINARY</strong>. Check this <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=there%20are%2010%20types%20of%20people%20in%20this%20world%2C%20those%20who%20understand%20binary%20and%20those%20who%20dont">joke</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Welcome any suggestions and replies re this new experimental series! Just a reminder that it won't be indeed daily. Welcome to tag alone and grow together!</em></p>
