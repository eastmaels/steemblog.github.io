<p>You must really like it to have followed to my 11th beta mode issue (okay, now you are confused whether I am talking decimal or binary. I don't know either). Can't thank you enough even if you are a bot (hi, @wang , so glad to have you around for so long. I was worried when you said you were leaving. check its only post should you got curious). I am not going to pretend that I am a popular columnist but given that this has come to the 11th issue (not again...), at least I am extremely popular under the #dailydialogue tag.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Picture of the Day</strong> - <em><strong>Books carry content and reward authors, and that's what Steemit is doing - in real time.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Something New at Steemit</strong></p>
<p>Nothing. Seriously, what do you expect from an daily update?</p>
<p><strong>Out of Steam</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, I don't have real content for today if the above picture and trash talk don't count. That is because I posted twice today. So please check them and enjoy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Note</strong></p>
<p>For those who thought the series number is back to normal as last issue jumped from #0001 to #0010, you will be surprised by the next issue number.</p>
<p><em>Welcome any suggestions and replies re this new experimental series! Just a reminder that it won't be indeed daily. Welcome to tag alone and grow together!</em>&nbsp;</p>
