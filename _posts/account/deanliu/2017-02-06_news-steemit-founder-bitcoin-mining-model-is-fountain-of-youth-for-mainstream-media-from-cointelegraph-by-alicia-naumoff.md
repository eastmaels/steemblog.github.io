<p>There was a news report from <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/">CoinTelegraph</a> by <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/alisa_tciriulnikova">Alicia Naumoff </a>on Jan 31 which contains interviews with Dan and Ned. Although this article begins with how blockchain technology can reshape the mainstream media but it quickly focuses on Steem as an example and goes on to introduce Steem/Steemit and the ecosystem around them. It even covers part of our 2017 Roadmap! I think it is quite informational and worth reading, but as I tried to search inside Steemit, I cannot find any post about it. So I decide to post it here so more can see it. You may check the original story here:</p>

<p>The only information new to me in this article is probably that <strong>Steemit Inc. now only has a staff of 15 people</strong> (including Dan and Ned) and they are expanding this year. Wow! only 15 people ... look what they have accomplished already!! and imagine what they can do if they expand!! &nbsp;:)</p>
