Lately I've been writing about my escape trip to Hualien in Chinese (see #bd-diary) and in my previous diary, I wrote about me buying a plush doll of Perry the Platypus in a local wanton cafeteria! ^_^ It reminded me of my son who is travelling in Europe with his mom and I miss them very much.

So I carry Perry, aka Agent P, around with me when I was wandering around in Hualien. This is the origin of this post. Most of Perry's photos were taken in the lodge I stayed or by the seaside where I spent a lot time. Say no more! Let's follow Perry the Platypus to see what he did in Hualien!! ^_^

中文區朋友們，[上一回的故事結尾](https://steemit.com/food/@deanliu/753q5l-b-d)已經鋪好這次的梗，回去看看，或是就直接來看Perry的花蓮之旅吧！^^

In case you do not know [Perry the Platypus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_the_Platypus), I'll quote wiki a little bit below and please see the link for more.

>Perry is the pet platypus of the Flynn-Fletcher family, and is perceived as mindless and domesticated. In secret, however, he lives a double life as a member of an all-animal espionage organization referred to as O.W.C.A. (Organization Without a Cool Acronym). Many secret entrances to his underground lair exist all around the house; such as the side of the house, most notably the tree that his owners sit under in the backyard, and several other everyday objects that seem to elude the family's attention. Perry also has entrances in Hawaii and North Dakota. He engages in daily battles with Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, an evil scientist who desires to take over the Tri-state area with obscure contraptions that work perfectly according to his intended function but fail in his application of them every time.

How could you not love him? ^_^ (and Hualien?) .... 

Hmmm, maybe I should consider making more ***Perry the Platypus*** series in the future ....
