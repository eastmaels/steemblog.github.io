<p>I found a small bug this morning and it is no big deal. But as it is quite funny, so I will post it to the community. If you click to check the timing of <em>any</em> upvoted comment under <em>any </em>recent post, you will find out that all the timing is "<strong>47 years ago</strong>"!</p>
<p>See this example. This is <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@neilstrauss/steemit-in-rolling-stone-magazine-looking-for-success-stories">where</a> I found it. And I was like... haha! even @papa-pepper is not that old (<em>or is he?</em>). Maybe @andre-ager , as the name suggests? is a prophet!? :-) .... No, it should be <em>just</em> a bug.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I got curious so I dig further... <em>47 years ago</em>... hmm... is it a special code? any hidden information? ... I knew this is a <em>crypo</em>-community and nothing is by coincidence! So I googled and found that the year 1969 (yes, 47 years ago) is actually the year when "<strong>networks come online</strong>"... wow... <em>what an year</em>!!&nbsp;also did you see "late October"?</p>
<blockquote>"Switched on in late October 1969, the ARPAnet is the first large-scale, general-purpose computer network to connect different kinds of computers together. But others come online within weeks or months." &nbsp;</blockquote>

<p><strong>I am so impressed with what a little bug in the comment section of Steemit can teach me.</strong></p>
<p><em>Now I don't know if we should remove it or not</em> ...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>update</strong>. if you visit steemd.com, you might find this timing appears twice on the left "1969-12-31 23:59:59". I guess this is like the time zero in this system and it might be the reason behind '47 years'.</p>
