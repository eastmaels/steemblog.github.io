<p>This is my first time participating the famous <strong>Steemit Photo Challenge</strong>. Normally I just browsed through most photos for this contest before and this time I decided to give it a go. Why? Simply because ... I cannot miss the theme this week. It is ...</p>
<h2>Food !!!</h2>
<p>I love to eat good food, but meanwhile sometimes I eat really simple just for filling the stomach. I love all kinds of food - Chinese of course, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Malay, Indian, Western,... almost every kinds of meals in the world. I cannot say that I 'love' Chinese food the most, because you were raised up on it, you <em>are </em>it and there is no room for you to keep a distance and say you love it (hope you understand what I am saying). Meanwhile me and my wife love to travel and dine and take photos for fun. So, it is really a good timing for me to take part in this contest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only pick one photo from my files - the one that I find of photographic qualities - colorful, shapes, and perspective. Also, I cannot use those that I had used for previous posts (or can I?). So I will list a few 'food' posts at the end for you to take a look. Hope you enjoy this and those!</p>
<h2>My Entry</h2>
<p><strong>A Chinese Style Banquet - Soup in the middle, lots of dishes around, with different varieties ... looks like someone has started eating already! Let's dig in!</strong></p>

<p>第一次參加Steemit Photo Challenge這個攝影的競賽，原因無他，因為本周主題是「食物」。我這麼愛吃，又喜歡旅行與(廉價手機式)攝影，想想就跳下來參加一下囉！</p>
<p>這張照片是在北京一次吃飯時拍的，有點忘記地點與場合，但照片表現出中式餐飲的特色，而且顯得很多彩、豐富與可口，所以就挑這張吧。</p>
<p>後面放了一些過去分享過的食記與食物照，還沒吃過飯的等吃飽再來看吧！:)</p>
