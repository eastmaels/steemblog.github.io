How powerful are words?

>*Well, that depends on what it's about.*

If you say so, let me rephrase: how powerful are ***ideas***? are ***thoughts***? are ***languages***?

It is almost ***e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g*** about humans' ***being***, ***existence***, however you call it. The physical world is only the becoming of human ideas.

If you seem to agree with me so far, then I have established the argument that **words are so fundamental and powerful, if not the only thing that matters in this whimsical world**.

Next question: what cryptocurrency in the world right now is most pertinent to the *token of **words***?

**[Steem](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steem/)**. What else?

I suppose most of you agree since most readers are Steemians. Let's just take the liberty of calling Steem *the token of words*.

Then, think about it - *have we striven enough to make Steem deserve, or even barely deserve, this name, this signifier*?

No. Not even close.

So far it is only close enough to make someone like me come up with wishful queries like this one.

We have not done enough. We have not said enough. Most important of all,

### We have not dreamed bold and big enough!

<br>I know that at the end of the day, ***the token of words*** should rank top on the list.

I just don't know if it will be Steem. 

### Steemians, dare you dream?
