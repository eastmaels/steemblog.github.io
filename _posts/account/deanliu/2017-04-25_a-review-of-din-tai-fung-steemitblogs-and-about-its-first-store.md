<p><strong>Din Tai Fung</strong> is probably the most famous restaurant from Taiwan in the world. As so many Steemians have blogged about their dining experiences in many branch stores of DTF around the world. The most famous one is by @sweetsssj at a Hong Kong branch. <strong>The point is, as much as we love sweetsssj, her guest is Ned. Oh, Ned is real person, don't you know?! :) See here</strong></p>

<p><strong>And our top notch travel guru @knozaki2015 also have two posts about this restaurant. Yummy, it seems...</strong></p>

<p><strong>Let's not forget my dear friend @ace108 also tasted it in Singapore (wow, the noodles...)</strong></p>

<p>I tried them several times actually but I did not blog even once. <strong>Well, it is common to eat in a DTF here in Taipei</strong> (LOL...) &nbsp;But I have never went to <a href="http://discoverbooktravel.blogspot.tw/2015/03/din-tai-fung-yong-kang-street-taipei.html">the very FIRST store of DTF in the Yong Kang St</a>.... It is always packed with tourists from all over the world, especially from Japan. And it is a small 3-story store. Cannot accommodate many diners, thus creating a bit of mystery among gourmets...&nbsp;</p>
<p>We went to Yong Kang St to have a walk last weekend and it is still jammed. Well, that's why I make this post... :) Just to show you that this sacred store is as always...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FULL OF PEOPLE!!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>oh, is't the Xiao Long Bao figure at their door so adorable? :)</strong></p>

<p><em>Edit note//</em></p>
<p>good to know that my casual post led to this one by a Korean friend @yoon (from his photo, I edited my description above too - it is a <em><strong>3</strong></em>-story store!)</p>
