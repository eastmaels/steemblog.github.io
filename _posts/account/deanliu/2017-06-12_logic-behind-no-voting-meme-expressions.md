<p>Hello again newbies!! You thought this series (<a href="https://steemit.com/funny/@deanliu/logic-behind-upvoting-meme-expressions">#1</a> and <a href="https://steemit.com/funny/@deanliu/logic-behind-flagging-meme-expressions">#2</a>) is finished right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, not yet!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>For most of your time here, you posts only receive a very tiny fraction of all users on this platform. That's true even for the most popular bloggers! Currently we have <em><strong>184,568</strong></em> registered accounts!! (<a href="https://steemd.com/">steemd.com</a>) and yet we hardly see any post receives more than <em>1,000</em> votes!</p>
<p>So, you not only need to learn the <a href="https://steemit.com/funny/@deanliu/logic-behind-upvoting-meme-expressions"><em>LOGIC BEHIND UPVOTING</em></a> and the <a href="https://steemit.com/funny/@deanliu/logic-behind-flagging-meme-expressions"><em>LOGIC BEHIND FLAGGING</em></a>... But you also need to know the <em>LOGIC BEHIND </em><em><strong>NO</strong></em><em> VOTING</em>!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>You probably don't care if you don't get votes from <em>ALL</em> users, but what about your <em>followers</em>, <em>friends </em>and long supporting <em>whales </em>(at least <em>you thought so</em> from your side...) ... You may find some answers below and as always, hopefully with some laughter! :)</p>
