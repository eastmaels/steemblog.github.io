<p>In recent years, <em><strong>Japan</strong></em> has been a top favorite travel destination for my family. We developed this preference accidentally by the low prices of Japanese Yen and later were trapped into Japan's unique <em><strong>culture</strong></em> and beautiful <em>sceneries</em>, oh, and the <em>cuisines</em> as well!</p>
<p>In this post, I am going to share some photos taken with you from our short 2-day trip during our major Tokyo one week journey. We weren't expecting much but the sheer beauty of nature made us <em>astonished</em> again and again and we quickly recovered our energy from the tiresome shopping spree in Tokyo before this short trip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This short trip was to <strong>Okunikko</strong> （奧日光）and <strong>Senjogahara</strong> （戦場ヶ原，せんじょうがはら）.</p>
<p>Let the photos speak for us. Include our neat and simplistic accommodation as well. Hope you enjoy them!&nbsp;</p>
