<p>A week ago I wrote <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@deanliu/news-we-have-a-welcome-bot-now-let-s-welcome-it-">a post for letting more know about the existence of a welcoming bot</a> - @welcomebot and it seems it has welcome&nbsp;1953 new users now!! Only in 9 days! Incredible and well done!&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://steemitimages.com/DQmRDzsHjWykYKwBN68PEKb5LJg86nhy4e5MxvhbmqQKoZZ/image.png</p>
<p>It has also&nbsp;slightly changed its avator from red heart to a blue one with Steem logo.</p>

<p>I have promised in that post that&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><em>Liquid Rewards Sharing: 1/3 to</em> <a href="https://steemit.com/@welcomebot">@welcomebot</a> , 1/3 to the new user from whom I learnt about this bot (will be a surprise for him), and 1/3 keep for myself.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>And the payout is confirmed now. The liquid reward is $37.302 SBDs. 1/3 of it is about $12.5 SBDs</p>
<h3>The question is ... who is this "new user from whom I learnt about this bot" that will get these SBDs?&nbsp;</h3>
<p><br>
<strong>The answer is .... @pamanbear who just joined this month!</strong></p>

<p>Here is his <a href="https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@pamanbear/newbie-from-downunder-excited-to-be-part-of-this-friendly-steem-community">introductory post</a> and here is <a href="https://steemit.com/photography/@pamanbear/friday-trivia-what-the-heck-is-this">the latest post</a>. Vid is his name. Vid is living in Sydney Australia and works in the area of art and design. He didn't know about this little surprise. I am sure. As I have offered to help him a little bit during his early stage on Steemit. So we had some conversations on Steemit.chat already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't told him yet. So...&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Congratulations Vid! I hope Enjoy your time here!&nbsp;</h3>
<p><br>
Since I will be earning more from this post, I will increase the money to <strong>$15 SBDs</strong> each. So, please continue supporting @welcomebot and maybe upvote @pamanbear 's post if you like it. We haven't had the fortune to see his art post yet... So, Vid, what are you waiting for? :)</p>
<p>Last, as always... to the moon!</p>
