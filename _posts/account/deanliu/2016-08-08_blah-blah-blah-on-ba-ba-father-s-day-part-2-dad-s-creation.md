<h2><strong>August 8</strong></h2>
<p>is celebrated as Father's Day in Taiwan. @magicmonk 's <a href="https://steemit.com/life/@magicmonk/happy-father-s-day-to-my-dad-08-08-is-father-s-day-in-taiwan-because-8-is-pronounced-as-ba-which-is-dad#@deanliu/re-magicmonk-happy-father-s-day-to-my-dad-08-08-is-father-s-day-in-taiwan-because-8-is-pronounced-as-ba-which-is-dad-20160808t051740618z">88card</a> reminds me that I actually started my very first Steemit self-introduction (didn't use the popular introduceyourself tag as I did know back then) post with a title &quot;<a href="https://steemit.com/introduction/@deanliu/a-father-from-taiwan-thinking-introducing-myself-a-bit">A father from Taiwan. thinking ...</a> &quot;…  </p>
<h3><strong>Oops, sorry! </strong></h3>
<p>I forgot that you have already read part 1 of this twin post (here is the link: <a href="https://steemit.com/life/@deanliu/blah-blah-blah-on-ba-ba-father-s-day-part-1-ethan-s-work"><strong>Blah Blah Blah on Ba Ba Father's Day - part 1 - Ethan's work</strong></a>). <em>For those who have not, please do so to correctly decipher the messages embedded in this </em><em><strong>follow-up, but more important, because this one is my work and I am the father</strong></em><em>, post</em>. Thank you. </p>
<p>Part 2 begins now. <em>Go pee before you read on</em>.</p>
<h2><strong>My Son Was An Agent</strong></h2>
<p>It happened almost three years ago.</p>
<p>It was a freezing night. I wasn’t there when this happened and I blame myself for not being there to protect them, my beloved wife and son, from … can’t say no more, see for yourself. </p>

<p>So now you know. I am agent Mulder’s father. Don't tell anyone (that this guy is lunatic). </p>
<p>X-files had been so popular in Taiwan. My wife and I both love this TV series so much (and yes we do think Mulder and Scully should be together). As for why I did this…    </p>
<p>It happened almost three years ago.  </p>
<p>It was a freezing night. I wasn’t in the photo because I was busy taking pictures for my beloved wife and son when we were staying at <strong>Regent Taipei</strong> (for more on this hotel, see <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@deanliu/leslie-chow-from-hangover-is-in-a-hotel-room-next-door-to-me-live-from-taipei-taiwan">my lately report on Leslie CHOW</a>… ). Regent had a giant light ball set up at the plaza in front of the hotel as a celebration of the Chinese Lantern Festival during the new year holidays. </p>
<p>We were all excited and Ethan especially as he probably saw such a big light ball for the first time in his life. Afterwards when I browse these pictures and I suddenly had an idea of combining them together to make an X-files prequel to amuse ourselves. <strong>Never thought that one day I will have the chance to show them to the world and in a fancy and meaningful way</strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, apology for the low quality of the pictures. It’s not easy to take good photos at night using my cheap cameras. But the story of agent Mulder is also kind of obsolete itself, isn’t it? <em><strong>Love transcends time and low quality photos. </strong></em></p>
