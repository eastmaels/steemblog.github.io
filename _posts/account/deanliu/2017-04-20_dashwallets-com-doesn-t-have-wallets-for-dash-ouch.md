<h3>This morning I thought it's time to take a further look at DASH as a while ago I read several posts regarding this coin, like:</h3>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://steemit.com/dash/@tommycordero/infographic-dash-for-dummies-or-people-with-very-limited-time"><strong>[INFOGRAPHIC] Dash for dummies or people with very limited time.</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/cn/@xiaohui/btc-dash"><strong>&nbsp;借大家关注 BTC 的这波风潮，科普和分享一下 DASH</strong></a></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It's likely that I will buy a very little amount after I study it so I think I can have a look at its wallets first. So I googled "dash wallet" and click the first link on the page and it looks very&nbsp;good ... I though "<em>Wow! this design is so relaxing and friendly as they put the photo of real wallets on the front page!</em>" And, I noticed the pink&nbsp;promotion code at the top of the page is "COOLBEANS" ... &nbsp;The discount is "10% OFF" so I instantly regard them as "hardware wallet provider" for DASH as no one will provide 10% off your purchase of DASH coins and soft wallets normally don't charge you. The only logical explanation is hardware wallets. "Okay, it's not what I want. But I can browse around..."</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>So when I saw lots of "wallets" on this page, I was like "<em>come on guys... you even combine your hardware wallets with real wallets! that's really thoughtful</em>" Since I saw a keyword "RFID" in one of the wallet, I was still convinced that they sell hardware wallets for DASH. But doubts are growing ...&nbsp;</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Then I clicked the "<strong>Get $10</strong>" (hey, everyone wants free money!) ... the page popped out and says</p>
<p>https://steemitimages.com/DQmTjg9do7DBFXNC4H4Y6KswEz2oUpxKSGPTf9MugVWipLK/image.png</p>
<blockquote><strong>Give friends&nbsp;25% off their first order, and you'll get&nbsp;$10 when they make a purchase.</strong></blockquote>
<p>It still makes sense ... after all, every business has their own way of marketing and sales ... &nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After I further clicked <code><strong>About </strong></code>and <code><strong>Our Company</strong></code>, finally I came to realize that ...</p>
<h3>They actually SELL REAL WALLETS and DASH happens to be the brand name!!</h3>
<p>and, by the way ...&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Dash is a dog ... Meet Dash</h3>

<h3>Hey, don't blame me... they are leading the google search page of "dash wallet" without sponsorship!!</h3>
