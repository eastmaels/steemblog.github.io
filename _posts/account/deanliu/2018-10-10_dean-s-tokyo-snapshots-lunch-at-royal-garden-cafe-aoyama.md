Firstly, let's see this great view at Meijijingu Gaien Ginkgo Avenue. Magnificent!

At the beginning of this avenue is a very nice restaurant - **Royal Garden Cafe**

They have a bakery too... So, pay attention to their bread... they are yummy! ^^

The secret to enjoy fine restaurants in expensive cities like Tokyo is .... "*Lunch Menu*"!! Normally you still get to taste the authentic flavors of this restaurant but with a lower price! ^_<

The options are limited though. But enough for us, the one-time guest travelers.

After the meal, it's best to take a stroll along this garden-like avenue and .... digest! ^^

*this **Dean's Tokyo Snapshots** series ( #dean-tokyo as a specific tag) is my photographic diary for my family trip to Tokyo. Due to busy schedule and a naughty boy with us, I won't be able to write much but I will make sure that every photo that I choose means something, at least to me... I hope you enjoy this photo series as well as me! Feel free to comment but I probably won't have much time making replies often. Apologies first. :p*

***follow me @deanliu if you haven't! or not, if this does not interest you...^^***
