I visited Tokyo a few years ago and for some reasons I remembered a short lane in the Roppongi area. It is only like 100 meter long, but I had walked through it a few times and I really enjoyed walking on it and cannot specifically say why. So this time when I am back here, I pay it a visit again.

Starting from the side of the National Gallery Museum and heading toward Tokyo Midtown...

Oops, according to Google, it is 220 meters long... ^_^

Still has its tranquility and relaxing feeling...

Yes, I remember this little temple but I don't think there was such a high modern building behind it... Must be a new one...

This must be new too! The famous international coffee shop - *Blue Bottle*. They seem to be a perfect match.

Good to see it's still so charming... with some new looks though.

*this **Dean's Tokyo Snapshots** series ( #dean-tokyo as a specific tag) is my photographic diary for my family trip to Tokyo. Due to busy schedule and a naughty boy with us, I won't be able to write much but I will make sure that every photo that I choose means something, at least to me... I hope you enjoy this photo series as well as me! Feel free to comment but I probably won't have much time making replies often. Apologies first. :p*

***follow me @deanliu if you haven't! or not, if this does not interest you...^^***
