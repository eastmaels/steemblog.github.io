<p><strong>I love Tokyo - the food, the city, the neatness, the logic, the culture and the history. </strong></p>
<p>Shared some of my collection a couple days ago (yes, by collection I mean I had tried all of them). </p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/cuisine/@deanliu/treat-of-tokyo-a-collection-of-cuisine-from-a-trip-in-2015-winter"><strong>Treat of Tokyo</strong></a></p>
<p>Here are some more! Again, if you want to know which restaurant behind these photos, let me know. I will be happy to share. </p>
<p>Oh, by the way, the first dessert is ... literally the best I've ever had in my life (I am not into desserts at all)</p>
