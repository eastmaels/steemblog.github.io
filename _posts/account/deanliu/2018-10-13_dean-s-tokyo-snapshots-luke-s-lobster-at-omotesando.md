We ran into this street food store at Omotesando. It must be very good because ... 1) it was almost 2pm and still many customers willing to sit or stand on the sidewalk to eat it and 2) it is *not* cheap at all!

So we decided to give it a shot .... ^_^ Herd behavior really works when you are traveling.

This was what we ordered. A set of coffee, chips, and a combination roll of crab and lobster. It was a snack for us. The price is something like 1580 yen. Ouch!

Yet, I was happy! ^^

Indeed, it tasted good. A flavor of the sea. Wonderful. People kept pouring in...

*this **Dean's Tokyo Snapshots** series ( #dean-tokyo as a specific tag) is my photographic diary for my family trip to Tokyo. Due to busy schedule and a naughty boy with us, I won't be able to write much but I will make sure that every photo that I choose means something, at least to me... I hope you enjoy this photo series as well as me! Feel free to comment but I probably won't have much time making replies often. Apologies first. :p*

***follow me @deanliu if you haven't! or not, if this does not interest you...^^***
