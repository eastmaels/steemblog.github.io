**TL;DR - A friend suggested to me that I can try posting from busy.org so I did and I really like its new look!**

**摘要：有朋友建議我來試試Busy發文，所以我就來試試看。不錯，這新介面我喜歡。**

Ok! Since you read on, I will talk about what I found out to be great features on Busy. I was actually among the first batch of users on busy but to be honest I wasn't satisfied with the initial interface so I kind of forgot about it. Even later when I used it to post for a few times, that was probably because Steemit.com was down and I need alternative platform. Considering I once donated a few SBDs to busy and was awarded with a ***bronze medal***  (oops, cannot find it here this time, where have you been?^^), I am really glad that busy has transformed into a very attractive option for engaging with the Steem blockchain! Well done and congrats!

既然你繼續看下來，我就來侃侃歷史跟說說這裡的好。想當初我也是第一批試用Busy的白老鼠之一啊！只是當時真的設計的不是太好，畢竟是草創，所以我慢慢也忘記它了。後來，曾用過幾次，多半也可能是因為Steemit可能掛了，需要另一個發文的平台。不過，很多人可能忘了或不知道，我可是在這裡初期贊助了一些SBD，拿到一面感謝銅牌呢！只是這會兒倒是找不到了？所以，這次好好看了，很開心看它蛻變成這麼好用的介面！

I really love Busy's blog layout! The image is bigger and more significant and the shown first few words are longer so it's really clear to know about this post. This is better than Steemit's design. Of course, my preference only. Also, the inclusion of Voting Power and Voting Value on the left of my profile is also very convenient for me. Great!

文章呈現的版面，是我喜歡busy之處：首圖大張，引用文字也多不少。一目了然，看得很清楚這篇文章的內涵。像是我上面這篇就是感恩之詩，多麽美啊！ 此外，左邊的介紹有放入點讚能量與點讚金額，對我很方便，非常貼心喔！

**Activities** is one of the tabs on my profile page. This is really great! It's like a build-in Steemd so I don't have to switch back and forth to check my own previous actions. It's kind of like "*Sorry! Steem Apps... find other services to serve your clients, busy has covered these already*"... Oh, you can even filter those activities! How good is that!?

令人驚喜的是個人頁面上最右邊的**Activities** ，這裡可以看到你自己的點讚紀錄，獎勵入帳，別人點你或是回覆你等等！好方便啊！我這老人家在Steemit住太久了，都不知道這裡有好東東哪！方便就是棒棒，不用切換網站來找尋遺落的記憶，無價。而且，右邊還能選擇過濾特定記錄類別哪！真的是只有一個字....

<br>Click **Wallet**. Seems similar.. No, busy includes the prices for Steem/SBDs and even the 7-day charts are there too! Bravo! 

點開**Wallet**錢包，看似差不多。但這裡有市場價格啦！好方便呢。還能看到一週變化，嘖嘖！HODL !!

<br>On the discussion page, when you move your cursor to the number of votes, it will pop up a list of your voters so you can see who contributes how much to your post (of course, be grateful for ALL the votes!). This is also a very handy information (who should I vote now? .... hmm....^^ ) 

在文章頁面，當你把游標移到點讚數上面時，會自動出現這篇文章點讚者的貢獻度，按照金額排列。這訊息非常可以參考的，雖然我們應當每一個讚都很感謝！<del>接下來該點誰呢？...^^</del>

**Notifications** - this one is definitely something I have been looking for! I used to use a bot on telegram for receiving notifications but it was broken and never recovered. But I hate to find other Apps and the Steemit notification was notorious and at the end totally disappeared. It's great to see Busy has it covered! Thank you!!

右上方的通知真的是我非常需要的一項功能啊！曾經用過telegram上的一個機器人，但後來壞掉似乎也沒修理，官方的通知功能向來就非常你懂的，最近根本就沒見到了。我真的很懶得裝其他App來獲得這服務，所以看到Busy有這功能，真是再加好多分哪！（<del>只是以後不能裝沒看到了嗎？</del>）

Okay! That was my brief review of this new (to me) platform! Love it. No doubt. Neat and handy. Should definitely keep me ***busy***! ^_^ The only thing I don't quite understand and that might concern me is that Busy needs our active key to log in. I still don't know why though... Maybe someone can answer me in the comments. I will definitely be using busy to submit my posts more often from now on.

好！以上就是我對於這個我其實還不熟悉的新平台Busy的看法，很棒！簡潔又方便，不能要求更多了。唯一一點可能會介意的就是，為何一定需要用Active key來登錄？這點我還不太懂。或許有人可以幫我解答？但我想日後，我應該會更常來這裡發文了！這是肯定的！謝謝收看！晚安囉！^_^
