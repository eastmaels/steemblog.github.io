Since I [will be traveling soon](https://steemit.com/travel/@deanliu/going-to-tokyo-japan-soon) so I used some time to do a little homework and I found this article about top cities in the world for crypto spending.

According to this news report - 

[Check Out If You Can Spend Bitcoin Before You Book Your Next Holiday](https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/09/check-out-if-you-can-spend-bitcoin-before-you-book-your-next-holiday/)

from other source which has done some research on this topic, the crypto spending friendly cities of the world are ...

<h3>Top 10 List</h3>

1. Prague, Czech Republic (154 Venues)
2. Buenos Aires, Argentina (130 Venues)
3. San Francisco, USA (111 Venues)
4. London, UK (102 Venues)
5. Madrid, Spain (97 Venues)
6. Arnhem, The Netherlands (86 Venues)
7. Bogotá, Colombia (85 Venues)
8. New York, USA (80 Venues)
9. Vienna, Austria (79 Venues)
10. Berlin, Germany (77 Venues)

European cities and US cities are no surprises, South American cities are doing well too! To my disappointment, there is no Asian cities top the list. Originally I also thought Tokyo, Seoul or Singapore may appear there... (I know very well that Taipei definitely isn't crypto enough). Well, I will try hard to find some places that accept bitcoin in Tokyo when I travel there... 

So far I have done some homework and on my list are :

* The Pink Cow
* Ark Akihabara
* Sushi-Bar Numazuko Ginza 1st 
* BICQLO
* Hostel bedgasm
(*keeping digging....*)

By the way, let me add [@kafkanarchy84's comment to my post](https://steemit.com/travel/@kafkanarchy84/re-deanliu-going-to-tokyo-japan-soon-20181005t035438949z) here too... some overlap but his list is definitely more accurate than what I found on internet... 

>Two Dogs Taproom, Roppongi. - Foreign owned, English friendly, BTC and BCH accepted. One of my favorite spots!
>Sushi-Bar Numazuko Ginza 1st - Great sushi in Ginza, pay with Bitcoin!
>Any Bic Camera electronics store should accept Bitcoin, I think.
>The Pink Cow in Roppongi. Accepts BCH and Bitcoin. Right across the intersection from Two Dogs, mentioned above.
>NEM Bar - Small little bar near Shibuya that accepts all kinds of crypto currencies. TV displays current market prices. Total nerd hang out! Love it.
>St. Arnould - Out of the way little place that accepts various crypto’s for food and Belgian beer. Owner is a Japanese guy originally from Nagoya. Very cool cat.
>Royal Plaza 2F, 2-13-8 Akasaka

I won't try everyone but I will definitely keep them on my mind and try to visit them when I have time...

It's possible that some of them already stop this payment option, as things in the crypto world change too rapidly, haha!

Anyway, do you agree with this list of top 10? I've only been to Prague and Vienna on this list and when I were there last year, I actually did not see many stores accepting crypto, but I did not do any research then and again... things change quickly as well...
