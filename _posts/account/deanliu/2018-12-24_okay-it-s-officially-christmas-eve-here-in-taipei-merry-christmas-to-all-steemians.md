We have a decorated Christmas tree at home, but our place is a bit too messy to show you. So instead, above is the huge Christmas tree at Regent Taipei this year - so magnificent!! 

My son has grown to question if Santa really exists (quoting his classmate and saying that Santa is just in the storybook... etc), but this year, we still manage to make him believe in Santa because he's got a BIG bag of presents from this old grandpa!! Hohoho~~~ 

### Merry Christmas and Wish All of You a Great New Year Ahead!!
