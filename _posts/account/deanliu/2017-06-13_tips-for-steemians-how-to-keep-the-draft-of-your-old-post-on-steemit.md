<p>Okay, let me skip the process of nagging about how Steemit used to be blah blah blah ... The fact NOW is - <strong>you cannot edit a post older than 7 days</strong>. So you, the author, would be just like anyone else - a reader. What else? No one can touch it after 7 days! Says Steem blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><strong>Are you going to show us the secret way to bypass the blockchain and alter it!? (</strong><em><strong>with excitement~~~</strong></em><strong>)</strong></blockquote>
<p>Of course not, you silly. Nobody, really, <strong>nobody </strong>can mess with blockchain ok!?</p>

&lt;<a href="http://fotos.sapo.pt/tvmemoria/fotos/wickie/?uid=UrCtVzd8Jls5p43OSuvP">source</a>&gt;</p>
<p>However, today as I dig through my old piles of posts (purpose of which is blogged <a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@deanliu/steem-price-might-fall-but-i-will-still-be-happy-or-even-happier-this-is-why">here</a>), I found out a surprise!! You can literally keep the <em>editing status </em>of the post even after no matter how long! <a href="https://steemit.com/photography/@deanliu/luxury-hotel-series-regent-taipei-part-2-little-guests-and-good-morning-breakfast-part-2">This post of mine</a> is 7 months old so it's like from <em>the Jurassic Period of Steem</em> and it still works (I must had left it that way during my last editing)! You still cannot edit, but you will have access to "copy and paste!!" [woohoo! the holy grail of the internet age]. This is so important to us, the muggles, right!? my fellow muggles!? :)</p>
<p>Follow me and I will show you ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>See this post of mine on&nbsp;Nov 22, 2016. Almost 7 months ago. &nbsp;[<em>it was quite a hard time for Steem actually... not like lately</em>]</p>

<p>When I clicked it today, I saw the following status (<em>you won't see this as a reader</em>) ... What!? What's wrong? Looks like I am <em>still editing</em>!! I can add texts however I like and move things around ... and I can switch it to the <em>Raw HTML</em> mode too!!</p>

<p><strong>BUT!!</strong> This is just an illusion. When you really try to <em>save </em>the changes, error message appears (<em>voice from the blockchain God!</em>)</p>

<p>Still, we don't really want to <em>edit </em>old posts... that doesn't earn me anything, does it!?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We just want to copy from our old posts our maybe signature, maybe useful image links or something I always like to quote, etc... and paste it to our new post. So this, <del><em>be it a bug of Steemit or not</em></del>, is cool to have at the moment.</p>
<p>BUT!! It is important to remember - once you click the <strong>CANCEL</strong> button, this status is gone forever!! FOREVER!! <em>No~~~</em>!!</p>
<p>So <em><strong>be very careful</strong></em> if you want to keep it that way for later use. It's like <em>the trust from a woman - once you break it, you can never get it back</em>....</p>
<p>And <em><strong>another reminder</strong></em> - check those recent posts near the 7 days mark and if you might copy them in the future,<em><strong> keep it in editing mode</strong></em>!!</p>
