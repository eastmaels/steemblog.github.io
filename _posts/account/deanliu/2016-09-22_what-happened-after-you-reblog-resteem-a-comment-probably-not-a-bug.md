<p><em>Please, don't bother reading this post if you are not extremely bored.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Steemit introduced the Promotion function. Somehow I found out that you could actually 'promote' a 'comment' (which is pointless obviously) and the team solved it very quickly along with the problem of promoting posts after first payout... Good. Great!</p>
<p>Days ago, Steemit introduced another new function - <strong>"Reblog"</strong> (or "Resteem" ?? I am confused...). Which is also interesting and great... Good! Well, this time again I found that there is a button for Reblog/Resteem when you have the comment shown in a single page. See here - comment to my <a href="https://steemit.com/cafe/@deanliu/coffee-and-exchange-of-ideas-which-is-more-real">linguistic coffee </a>from the poet @richardjuckes ...&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a such a strong desire to just click it and see what happens and I think Richard's comment looks very good to appear on my blog page so I will give it a go. Although, it is also quite pointless to<strong> reblog a comment</strong> (which is processed similar to posts in many ways inside the Steemit system). Anyway I clicked it and nothing happened. Nothing new showed up on my blog page. There is one error message though. Saying... (sorry! Richard! your comment is not <em><strong>Top level</strong></em> enough... :p)</p>

<p>So... Conclusion:<strong> You CAN click the reblog button at the comment page but nothing will happen (have fun clicking though... )</strong>. And, this is not a bug as the team has obviously cut off this possibility (they just haven't found time to remove the button I guess... ). If you really want to see bugs... check here: <a href="https://steemit.com/photography/@deanliu/butterfly-kids-and-blue-bugs-amazing-insect-world">my bugs</a> or @pfunk 's <a href="https://steemit.com/photography/@pfunk/i-have-no-idea-what-this-weird-creepy-crawly-thing-is">more beautiful(?) bugs</a>... &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Have a great day!!</em></p>
