<p>Lately I have been thinking, reading and writing so much about Steemit and all the crypto new world. Too much that I cannot organize them systematically to share with others. Just like the other day when I saw this scene when going to work and&nbsp;I was quite surprised that my first thought on this demolition work was:</p>
<p><strong>Isn't this what Steemit and other blockchain-based new models are doing to the world?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/13/IMG_20160812_08385032ed2.jpg</p>
<p>And today I saw my page reach these comfortable numbers (however, 200 posts are not actually 200 "posts", see <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@deanliu/number-of-posts-shown-on-users-page-should-be-re-considered">here</a>), an idea presented itself: <em>why not keep track of what I thought, learnt, or even wondered in a personal way without obvious themes so I get to share many random things in my head and also document my crypto-growth every step of the way?</em> (see how no post type distinction drives me so - <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@deanliu/post-should-have-different-properties-in-the-future-not-just-with-its-content-tagged">here</a>)</p>

<p>A name like <strong>Daily Dialogue</strong> sounds cool (Deanliu's Daily Dialogue, even more so!), so I started the beta mode as a trial version like this one. Maybe someday I will do it officially like <strong>SteemMag</strong> (by @infovore ) but of course not so professional...&nbsp;</p>
<p>There we go. Some new developmentt I saw just now that I can share with you - introduction of Trending (30 days) - so we can check trending post of every tag within this month. Hence I get the 2nd place currently under #cn tag (thanks to you guys!) with this new feature. What an honor and surly feels great!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Welcome any suggestions and replies re this new experimental series! Just a reminder that it won't be indeed daily. Welcome to tag alone and grow together!</p>
