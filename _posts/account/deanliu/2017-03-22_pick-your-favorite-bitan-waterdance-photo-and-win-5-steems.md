<p>New Taipei City has come up with a "water dance" show in its famous tourist spot, Bitan 碧潭 (famous for the suspension bidge and the riverside area), since Jan 3 this year. We went there to spend the weekend relaxing beside the river, in the restaurant and on mountain trails. And luckily we have also witnessed this show and I took many shots to capture it on photos. It looked small from where I stand but afterwards when I check the photos. It is interesting to see so many variations caused by water and the colorful lights.</p>
<p>So I think they are worth sharing. To further spice it up a little bit, I will give away at most 3 comment rewards with <strong>5 steems </strong>each for three most creative comments (obviously I will be the judge).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To enter, just comment with which photo of waterdance you like the most and describe it whatever you like.</strong></p>
<p>This giveaway is partly triggered by @ace108 's <a href="https://steemit.com/food-trail/@ace108/heavenly-wang-meal-chance-to-win-steem-here-or-heavenly-wang-steem-by-ace108">recent post</a>, from which I earn 6 Steems! Time to pay it forward.&nbsp;</p>
