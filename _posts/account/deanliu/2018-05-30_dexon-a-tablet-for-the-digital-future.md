<sub>***Disclaimer**. This post is written just for fun and contains barely any useful information - neither medical nor blockchain (what?). It is for the amusement of still some small group of people on Earth (if they ever find out about this... ) and if you don't have a clue after you read this, I sincerely hope that you will after quite some time because it might mean that I am rich, finally. lol* </sub>

Sorry, this post is not about Morpheus' famous [red pill and blue pill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pill_and_blue_pill). No, no, no. It is about something *potentially* big, something that might alleviate some *problems*, something that seem to be *swallow-able* ... well, a bit of the above and none of it is real. I deliberately try to hide the main topic of it and disguise it with something totally irrelevant because I still don't know how to understand it. So, just for fun and nothing else. Feel free to pretend that you get the fun, since I guess 9 out of 10 who read this won't get it. ***Isn't it funny? haha!!***~~~~

Ok, here it comes -  the following content is a spoof of [this original medicine introduction page](https://www.tabletwise.com/nigeria/dexon-tablet).

<h2>What is Dexon?</h2>

Dexon contains *Decentra-thatstheone* as an active ingredient. Dexon works by combining or re-inventing several different pioneering DLT (*don't like tradition*) solutions like *lego-lattice*,  *asynchronous Bywhatime Free Throw algorithm*, *d-Pose* and etc. The **C.H.O. Inc.** will manufacture Dexon along side with partnership from the **I**-**D**o-**G**ood organization. Dexon is now hiring anyone interested in saving the world.

******************
<h2>Dexon's Uses</h2>

Dexon is used for the treatment, control, prevention, & improvement of the following existing DLT issues, conditions and symptoms:

* High-latency issues
* Significant transaction fees
* Limited scalability issues
* Low transaction throughput symptoms
* Probabilistic finality
* High energy wasting problems 

******************
<h2>Dexon's Side-effects</h2>

The following is a list of possible side effects that may occur from the use of Dexon. This is not a comprehensive list. These side-effects are possible, but do not always occur. Some of the side-effects may be rare but serious. I don't know what you should do if you observe any of the following side-effects.

* Grumpy exchange investors (*could been who?*) before Dexon promises any freebies
* New forces uprising leading to the overturn of the ByNancy era
* Trampled by those huge public metal rope incumbents before Dexon is even known by the world
* Not only John but everybody needs Dapps
* Redundancy problem for ***popolambos*** (*the phenomenon of receiving too much resource at the very early stage of lifespan*)
