<p>dear all, been here for some time but not really long... from time to time I ponder over how STEEM might develop in the future and most of the time feel confused... so try to get some good answers from you steemians.</p>
<p>Q1. Can a group of people manipulate the system? for example, if somehow a group of, say 100, people with strong connection in real world, say a MLM team, can they come here and upvote/discuss within only their group? I mean of course I know they can, but can they thus exploit the system so that they get a lot cashout in return but they hardly contribute to the community?</p>
<p>Q2. Is language going to be an issue for STEEM? I mean right now almost all popular posts are in English, but as steem moves on it no doubt will develop globally. Then the language issue will kick in, how is it going to affect the system? Is it going to be divided into many blocks determined by languages? </p>
<p>Q3. Is there going to be a market place for knowledge (or any intagible item that can be exchanged over internet) transaction? Since the uniqueness of STEEM is its currency/reward system incorporated, it will be quite a waste if it is only used to give out reward. Because content production and the currency system can be easily implemented to enable a market for knowledge exchange/service with price. It will go much further than facebook not just in terms of rewarded content creation.</p>
