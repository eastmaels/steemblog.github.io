Thanks to @rea ([link](https://steemit.com/photography/@rea/the-seven-day-b-and-w-challenge-day-four)), @helene ([link](https://steemit.com/sevendaybnwchallenge/@helene/the-seven-day-b-and-w-challenge-day-one)) and also myself @deanliu ([link](https://steemit.com/sevendaybnwchallenge/@deanliu/the-seven-day-b-and-w-challenge-day-one-by-deanliu)) ^_^ for nominating me for the Black & White Photo Challenge! Although I have [some complaints](https://steemit.com/sevendaybnwchallenge/@deanliu/the-seven-day-b-and-w-challenge-day-four-by-deanliu#comments) and have already broken many rules, fun is there too! :)

My entry today:

![IMG_20130923_082440 (1).jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYtGvRT7dEfJWKTjewvQrqU38oxMHv6NwJ7agrrnBEkfZ/IMG_20130923_082440%20(1).jpg)

### The rules :

* Take 7 black & white photos that represent an aspect of your life
* Present one image every day for seven days
* No people
* No explanation
* Nominate someone every day. Although anyone can join in
* Use the tag: #sevendaybnwchallenge as one of your five tags

### 規則如下：

* 7張代表你生命一部分的黑白照片
* 一天發出一張照片
* 没有人的照片
* 没有解釋
* 每天提名一個人但任何人都可参加
* 其中一個標籤必須用: #sevendaybnwchallenge

Oops! The rule I broke today is that I also include the *slight-color version* of the photo, why not? I love this kind of presentation! 

今日打破的規則是：同時放入這張照片的"有點顏色"版本，我常常覺得這種有點顏色的照片很迷人呢！一點點，但又不給你太多，引人入勝啊~~~~

I nominate @confucius because this is also an inactive account but I once had great interaction with him so would be great to see it back to live too. 

我提名孔子 @confucius 來參加，這帳號已停止活動一年了，但當初我跟他互動過，挺有趣的，前塵往事，透過這無聊的提名，來遙想一番！

And if you think this is my final post for this challenge, think again! I might break the biggest rule of all - Seven posts!! Who knows? Stay tuned .... :)

如果你以為我七天挑戰完成了的話？可別忘了我是專門來破壞規則的，誰說一定得七篇呢？我照片數量都超標了呢 ~~~ 哈哈，不告訴你，我也不知道~~~ 高興的話，也許再來一次？ ^_^
