Ok, the hottest news in town and I suppose you already know that - SBD is *Super Brilliant Dollars* that trading around $5-$7 today!

This got me interested to look further about this asset. So I dig a little bit further. According to https://steemd.com/, we now have 3,559,194.378 as ***current_sbd_supply***. That is more than three and half million SBDs out there. With SBD skyrocketing to the moon now, I suppose many SBD owners would transfer their SBD in the wallet to exchanges and sell. So I checked [SteemWhales.com's SBD wealth ranking](https://steemwhales.com/?p=1&s=sbd) and found out that ...

**WOW!! More than 65% of the system's pegged assets is now moved to the top 2 exchanges!** 

So I made the following top 20 SBD holder table for your information here. Top 20 holders account for more than 72% of total supply!

The result is not surprising as a supposedly $1 asset somehow goes nuts and trading at more than 5, 6, 7 times its intrinsic value of course will enormously drive people who hold them to dig every cent of it and sell for this unusual profit... (I sold most of mine at $2 to $3, which is great already and never did I foresee this coming)

The mystery is therefore ...

### Who is buying? 

<br>Certainly this chart won't give us any clues as buyers are hiding behind the exchanges... I don't know if we will ever know this answer in the future...

But even if we don't. As long as there is someone buying in such a good price for most of us ...

### Can we hard fork to produce much more SBDs to them?

<br>It seems logical to do so, but without a logical answer to the first question, every move seems weird though.

### Gosh! Aren't these crypto stuffs so freaking interesting!

瘋狂了，SBD我從沒見過能到7刀的，瘋狂至極。我2-3刀早就賣光光，實在是難以想像背後原因。無論如何，勢必大家都把床底下的，內層口袋裡藏的，所有SBD都掏出來賣了吧？看來越晚知道得越好啊！難不成會上10刀？

因此我就研究了一把，把SteemWhales的SBD排行拉出來看，果然六成都到了交易所了，甚至前20持幣者占了總供給的七成以上！總量也就是三百五十多萬刀，讓我不禁想，第一，到底誰在買啊？背後原因實在令人費解。

幾個月前的那一波，我接受了一種解釋就是幣圈韭菜湧入，見幣就瘋狂亂買，所以把這個錨<del>不</del>定的資產也給胡亂買入了。但這一次，明顯就是人為操作啊！有人猜測是官方想有些什麼動作，但我怎麼想都不明白啊！

要不乾脆硬分叉來餵給市場好了，這不是蠻好的策略嗎？Steem整體媒人受損啊？分叉個幾百萬顆新的SBD給他們去買吧！反正我們的債權就是一刀 ... 哈哈，不過，似乎天下沒這麼好的事啊？

目前，大家就是只能寫文章攢SBD了.... 年底怪事特別多？
