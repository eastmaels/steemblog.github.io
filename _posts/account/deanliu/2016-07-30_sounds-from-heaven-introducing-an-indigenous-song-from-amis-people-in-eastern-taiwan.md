<p>In Taiwan there are roughly 550k indigenous population and Amis people is among the main indigenous peoples with 204k population (all minorities of course in contrast to total taiwan population being 23m). These indigenous peoples are so talented in singing and I am so attracted to their voices and music. So i wish to introduce it to the Steemit music community. All income from this post will be donated to indigenous peoples charity after realization as they usually suffer from a lower social rank and are deprived of many equal opportunities. </p>
<p>This song <strong>Elders Drinking Song</strong> is performed by the late <strong>Difang Duana</strong> (1921-2002) who were considered national asset in Taiwan. He was originally a Amis farmer from Taitung and later discovered by a musical professor. He then went all the way to become an internationally known artist. This song had gain global impact first in 1993 when Enigma incorporated part of it in their famous &quot;Return To Innocence&quot; and later the latter song was selected as the official song for the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.</p>
<p>It has magical power to bring peace to restless minds, to cure wounded hearts and to bring you vitality. Hope you enjoy it like me. </p>
