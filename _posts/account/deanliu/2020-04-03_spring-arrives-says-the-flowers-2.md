Continuing our last photo sharing ... 

Today's weather in Taipei gets colder, but not much rain though. They say that Spring has a step-mother's face here, meaning that the weather changes very fast in spring. Exactly like today. Ha!

These photos show flowers in the corners of a city as you can see buildings and cars in the background.

***Spring is here! Told you.***
