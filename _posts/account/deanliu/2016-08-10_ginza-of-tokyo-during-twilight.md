<p>Previously I have shared a few times photos taken in Tokyo and gratefully some friends like them (you may check <a href="https://steemit.com/@deanliu">my blog</a> for them). As my family is currently planning a trip to... well, yeah, Tokyo again, I browsed some photos from 3 years ago and found myself missing the feeling of strolling down the streets of <strong>Ginza</strong> - an internationally popular shopping area of Tokyo that can satisfy everything that a tourist would need. I don't particularly like shopping and all, but Ginza will attract you with her ever-changing appearance all day. I especially like to be there during twilight and people swarm to the street with amazing order and sunshine starts to fade away with street lights glowing gradually... Say no more. See for yourself.</p>

<p>Good news for the pedestrians is that Ginza cares about your walking rights! Each Saturday and Sunday, from 12 noon until 5 pm, the main street through Ginza will be closed off to road traffic, allowing people to walk at ease. The Japanese call it Hokosha Tengoku or Hokoten for short, literally meaning &quot;pedestrian heaven&quot;.</p>
