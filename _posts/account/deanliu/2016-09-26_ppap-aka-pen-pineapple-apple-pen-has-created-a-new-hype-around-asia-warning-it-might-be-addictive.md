<h3>Repeat after me first: <code>Pen Pineapple Apple Pen</code>. If you don't find this combination of words interesting, you can stop reading on...&nbsp;</h3>
<p>First, do you still remember Mr Psy from Korea who sings 'Gangnam Style' and made the world crazy about the song!? Well. this time, a Japanese uncle might be doing the same again soon and he is not even a singer...</p>
<p>Yes! This middle-aged Japanese man has created a new hype around Asia with his .... well, song? creation? You can see and listen for yourself. <strong>Basically the lyrics is... pen, apple, pineapple, pen, ... thus the PPAP abbreviation.</strong> Why is this weird 'song' so popular in Asia right now? Maybe you have your own answer!&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>This youtube video is the most viewed under PPAP search.&nbsp;</strong></h3>
