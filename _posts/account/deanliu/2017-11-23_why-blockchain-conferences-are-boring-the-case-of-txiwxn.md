I’ve been to some conferences wholly or partly under the theme of blockchain for the past year in Taiwan. It’s quite natural for me to attend these as I am totally a fan of blockchain and the future it envisages. However, I regret to say that I seldom learn anything insightful from these occasions.

Why? Are these conferences not good enough? Are those *distinguished guests* not distinguished enough? Or is it because I have become such a blockchain expert so there is so few out there that can teach me anything new and I am not aware of this situation?

As much as I would really like to be regarded as a blockchain expert, I am not. So why? what went wrong? That, I think, is a really meaningful issue to think about.

After I gave it some thoughts, there might be a few reasons for that. I think. So I write this post to share with you and maybe many feel the same as I am sure that many of you have also attended countless conferences and maybe some of you share the same experience with me.

First, blockchain is still too new for this world. Despite that many of you may have already known blockchain and its applications to a sufficient level, it is no doubt that this term is getting hotter and hotter around the globe day by day. In addition, this technology is not something that can immediately bring instant changes into our lives, but most of the time it just enables us to dream, to plan, to build your own idea based on such technology and the realization of those ideas depends on systematical change which again needs time to mature. So being new and being yet to be proven in some sense and being so massively potentially powerful, everyone can have their version of blockchain dreams, but with all due respect they are *just* dreams. What is the last time you listen carefully to someone other than your friends talking about their dreams?

Secondly, we have dreamers but at the same time we have lots of geeks. It’s quite anticipated that geeks’ talks are boring (unless the audience is full of geeks), but what the heck do the organizers put them up on stage to talk to us non-geeks? Well, yeah, it’s a new tech so even the organizers cannot really properly match their speakers and the audience, or even worse, there is just no experts in this field except this weird bloke. As long as he has a mouth, let’s put him up to talk!

So, from these two perspectives, my conclusion is that we need more thinking of **blockchain + domain knowledge** in the future as this technology matures more along the way. With this thinking, we can match the speakers and the audience more accurately and we will have less dissatisfied attendees. We will then have less and less so called *blockchain experts* but more and more *XXX-domain experts who knows how to use blockchain to leverage*. After all, do you know any *Internet experts* nowadays?

***I was actually writing this article amongst a conference in Taipei focusing on blockchain. See how bored I was?***  ^^

CN區朋友們好，

兩天都在外參加會議（朋友臨時有事而我忘記報名所以他讓我頂替去），利用開會中午空檔跑到附近咖啡廳發文聽起來是不是很精實啊？呵呵！

上面的英文是我談談這一年參加區塊鏈會議的心得，有興趣自己看吧，我不翻譯了。寫英文是因為怕旁邊人看到我寫中文內容，不好意思，哈哈！

這個會也是區塊鏈會議，我算是業餘身份參加，反正這類大小會議，其實也不少，很少是純粹技術性的。上面心得不說，我這裡還是分享一些我不認同的，所謂專家說的東西，然後，開放大家回答猜測，為什麼我不認同。最好且最早的答案我按讚100%，如果兩人各說一半就50/50。讓大家也有點參與感！^^

不認同之區塊鏈應用之一：小學生畢業證書。

不認同之區塊鏈應用之二：消費者紅利點數系統。

這兩個都是會議來賓，所謂專家提出的喔，第一項甚至是會做的。但是注意，我所謂的不認同，不是做不到。第二題比較難猜，因為我的理由可能有些人認為有點偏頗，我也認為在現實中，這項應用其實是可以做到商業化的，所以我的不認同比較是一種哲學式的理由？哈哈，我看是沒有人可以猜到了...
