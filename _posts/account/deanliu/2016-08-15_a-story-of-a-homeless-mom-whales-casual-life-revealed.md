<p><em>Be patient. We will get to the story soon.</em></p>
<p>Recently, we have been given more information about popular tags if you just click "<strong>Show more tags</strong>.." under "<strong>Tags and Topics</strong>" to the right of your screen. Then you get to see how different tags are doing during a certain period of time (I don't know how long it is). The information is good for users to learn more about what is hot and what is (relatively) not on this platform - be it helpful for using tags in own post or just for fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it may contain quite a lot of information about <em>how whales are swimming in this steemy blue ocean</em>. Many are keen on knowing how whales vote. That's fine, but that doesn't mean that we cannot care more about them as friends or the respected elders at the same time. Assuming that how tags are doing is highly associated with whales' activities, we get to know more about them as peer maritime creatures... Let's take a look.</p>
<p>First you have to remove all those "hard" and serious tags from the list like tags of <strong>steemit</strong>, <strong>steem</strong>, <strong>anarchism</strong>, <strong>bitcoin</strong>, <strong>bitshares</strong>, <strong>blockchain</strong>, <strong>market</strong>, <strong>money</strong>, <strong>politics</strong> and etc. <strong>introduceyourself</strong> must also be removed as it is part of whales' duties to welcome newbies. So, I narrow it down to <strong>23 "soft" tags </strong>that might reflect ones' true daily life aside from his/her job (and that is steemit for whales). See the following tags ranked by payouts from <strong>life</strong> to <strong>fitness</strong> with respective ratios calculated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok, obviously, the whales currently spend most of their attention in developing steemit as <em>the tag steemit (1,120,380) alone exceeds the total payouts from this list</em>. Still,<strong> they need to take a break from the serious matters and relax</strong> (but still on steemit as it is also part of the action to balance the content). We can see that whales love to <strong>travel</strong> and take <strong>photos</strong>. Aside from these, <strong>art</strong> is important and followed by <strong>food</strong> and <strong>marijuana</strong> (thank God they eat more than get high!). It is touching that the concern for <strong>homeless</strong> is more important than <strong>cooking</strong> for whaleselves.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Let's take a closer look. First, hobbies.</strong></h3>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/15/2fe91d.png</p>
<p><strong>photography</strong> and <strong>travel</strong>. Definitely among the hottest subjects. Then <strong>art</strong>, <strong>writing</strong>, <strong>music</strong> and <strong>story</strong> are at the second tier. A little bit worried about their <strong>sex</strong> life, seems not enough. Even worse, they do not have enough exercise - <strong>sports</strong> and <strong>fitness</strong> are too low. Hopefully they did <strong>travel</strong> enough to compensate this.</p>
<h3><strong>Next is diet.</strong></h3>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/15/34cac5.png</p>
<p>The tag <strong>food</strong> says little about what whales like to eat. But we can see that they like to cook (<strong>recipes</strong>), or just like to watch others cook? no idea. Specifically, they like <strong>coffee</strong>, <strong>smoothies</strong> and <strong>BBQ</strong>. Check @justinlaak and&nbsp;@healthyrecipes and find out more about <strong>thousand-dollar coffee and smoothies</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I have a problem categorizing <strong>marijuana</strong>, let's take a look here.</p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/15/4299e5.png</p>
<p>In general, <strong>marijuana</strong> is between <strong>food</strong> and <strong>philosophy</strong>. In terms of hobby, <strong>marijuana</strong> is less important than <strong>art</strong> but more so than <strong>writing</strong> (huh?). In terms of diet, <strong>marijuana</strong> is slightly less than <strong>food</strong> (live to get high) but more than any other specified food tags. That pretty much sums it up for marijuana.</p>
<h3>Last, let's analyze some more&nbsp;</h3>
<p>If we include replies and rank all soft tags by <strong>payouts/replies</strong>. We will get this ranking. This <strong>p/r ratio</strong> can be interpreted as an index showing the relationship between whales' love and that of the general public as whales have big influence on payout while everyone can engage in discussions. Maybe it can be interpreted as<em> the divergence between the preferences of whales and the general public given that these subjects are already on the table</em>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/15/5d9a54.png</p>
<p>We can see that <strong>food</strong> and <strong>drink</strong> categories tops the list a lot. Also, whales have good hearts to favor <strong>homeless</strong> subjects. Learn how to make <strong>coffee</strong> and <strong>smoothies</strong>, people!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Better yet, come up with<strong> A story on how a homeless mom with two kids traveling around with a vendor cart serving coffee, bbq and smoothies wins a big hand of poker and change her life and the philosophy behind it</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Finally, a piece of advice to whales</strong></h3>
<p><em><strong>Exercise more, try more new foods, more sex for marijuana and keep looking after the homeless!</strong></em></p>
