This post is not another report on SF2. Rather, this is a personal post from me, the coordinator, to summarize how this collaboration happened and how we five Steemians from the CN community come together to put this together and finished this task that seemly only professionals can do. This invaluable experience has taught me that as long as you can find the right persons to do the right things, together you can all achieve something remarkable. It is especially so given that resources (SP) associated with the CN community were significantly reduced right before SF2 (I am not going to argue if the act is right or wrong ... that's irrelevant here), so it made me as the coordinator to worry if we can still do it. After all, my original plan is to carry out these based on my estimation of potential rewards. But I am really glad that all the team members agreed to do their part irrespective of pays! They are wonderful teammates!!

>報導結束了。這篇文章只是想總結回憶一下這個美好合作發生的過程，非常感謝隊友們願意在寒冬提早到來CN區之際仍然鼎力支持，讓這個9月發想、10月規劃的兩地合作報導依然能夠實現，一方面我們在這過程非常享受那種第一時間知道事情彷彿人在現場的感覺，一方面也能造福讀者們能夠透過編輯後的文章一起參與... 非常感謝他們！

I am going to review a little bit this process that we come together to form a team and did this wonderful mission together! From this I also learn that - if you are gonna be a good ***curator***, do this!! not the kind of curator that tries to beat other whales to upvote a potentially good payout posts!! That's not what ***curation*** means in its original meaning!!

>下面我將回顧一下這場美好的合作。

This is the earliest Wechat group established in early Sep. I thought of the idea and knew that these three gals were going to the Fest so I gathered them together in this group. Unfortunately later on @liflorence could not go because of her job, so we were down to two reporters. 

>這是最早在九月時成立的微信群，那時我想到這主意，然後得知有三位美女要去Fest，於是趕緊上網秘密徵召，只是很可惜後來 @liflorence臨時行前因為工作原因而不能前往。所以剩下兩位前線記者。

<br>Then when the Fest date came closer, I used Telegram to form a new group as all of us are not inside mainland China and I preferred to use TG. I recruited my usual partners W and Y and that was when the five of us finally met online and could start to discuss what we wanted to report and how. 

後來時間接近，十月中時我改為在Telegram上成立群，把前線兩位美女記者與後方我合作的兩位編輯Wig與Ygern也納入，於是五人小組正式在空中聚會，開始討論如何作業，順便連絡一下感情。呵呵~~~ 反正賺不了大錢了~~~~~

<br>This is something I wrote in the group before Fest. I did not actually plan much, but let all of the team did what they felt like and it worked well! The reporters fed us with live photos, videos, texts and even audios and we tried to organize them together under certain themes that may looked interesting, fun or important... You can view our works above.

>這是群裡在Fest開始之際我寫的一些東西。其實，說規劃也沒有太多，大智說說想法，之後就放任大家自己做自己的工作，事實證明，大家合作得挺好的，記者不斷傳來照片、影片、簡單描述甚至是錄音檔，我們編輯擇自己從一堆混雜的材料當中，試著組合出看起來有內容、有趣或是八卦的報導... 很懷念那段合作報導的時光！
