<p>Thank you Steemit community!! I cannot believe that I have managed to produce a <strong>$100 level post</strong> with <a href="https://steemit.com/contest/@deanliu/myeuropaplog-best-comment-makers-and-their-prizes-announced-a-total-of-14-steems">this one</a>!! This is actually my historically <em>2nd largest</em> payout post!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you believe it!? If you look at my Rep currently sitting on 69, you probably think that I have made a lot of money in the past, that's not quite true. Or, to be more precise, I never made big money with any single post but one very early post [the historically highest payout post ($400+) has an interesting story/twist behind it, you may check this <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@deanliu/bye-bye-and-thank-you-to-the-bad-whale-berniesanders">past post of mine</a> should you be interested].&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have waited for so long (since last August) to finally witness my hundred dollar level post to appear!! (<em>Tears~~~~)</em></p>
<p>https://steemitimages.com/DQmeaoaYaYFRuZSU6db34v35n74veHB3r9N1kncj8kNGoEz/image.png</p>
<p>And I am <em><strong>so happy</strong></em> that it turns out to be a post about <em><strong>giving out</strong></em> (check <a href="https://steemit.com/contest/@deanliu/myeuropaplog-best-comment-makers-and-their-prizes-announced-a-total-of-14-steems">its comments</a> about me not anticipating this to happen, of course the payout isn't confirmed yet, I know... )...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually I am working on a post on the concept of sharing and why it is important for Steem/it, so this post has encouraged me in a great timing to confirm that <em><strong>by giving out to others, you get more. And by everybody believing so, everybody gets more</strong></em>. [yeah, something I will elaborate in my next post mentioned]</p>
<p>Actually, a while ago, I almost achieved this goal during my travel post series to Jiufen ...&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/photography/@deanliu/junction-of-life-jiufen-photo-series-011-201757t65446758z">Junction of life - Jiufen photo series 011</a> [see the screenshot under]</p>

<p>Again, I did not expect the photos from this accidental shooting idea to go viral - it <em><strong>is </strong></em>an interesting idea, but hey, <em>I used a smartphone and look at the photo quality</em>... it is awful!! :D</p>
<p>I would be happy if it had passed the $100 mark, but it wouldn't mean the same with this one...</p>
<p>With @darthnava's <a href="https://steemit.com/blog/@darthnava/fellow-steemers-i-need-help-as-my-mri-results-are-not-encouraging">trending post</a> achieving more than $8000 at the moment, this reminds me of early Steemit moments - so many helping posts to help those in need... Positive energy generates positive energy, and I like and cherish this kind of community culture (if you don't know what is positive energy, go check @papa-pepper 's posts as well as what he has done for others!).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, this post serves to say<strong> thank you all for supporting me</strong> and I will continue to try to benefit Steemians around me as much as I can so your support will be maximized inside this great <strong>Steemiverse</strong>!! (instead of transferring it all to pxlxnieo and trading it for money for me).</p>
<p>Let me say it again as it is too important ...&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>By giving out to others, you get more!</strong></em></blockquote>
