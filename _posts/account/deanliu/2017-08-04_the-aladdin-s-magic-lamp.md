<p>I promised to&nbsp;share a little story behind the two Aladdin's lamps three weeks ago at the end of my travel post below:</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/travel/@deanliu/travel-around-taiwan-hot-spring-in-beitou">🚉 [輕旅行系列] 北投，溫泉 🚉 [Travel Around Taiwan] Hot Spring in Beitou</a></p>
<p>So this is what today's post is about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I tell you this little short story, just in case you don't know who Aladdin is and what is about his magic lamp. Please <a href="http://www.kidsgen.com/stories/classic_stories/aladdin_and_the_magic_lamp.htm">check this out</a>. I think this man and his whimsical gadget should be globally known. But in a nutshell, if you happen to possess such a magical lamp, rub it and a Genie of the lamp will be summoned to grant you three wishes. Yeah, pretty much any wishes...</p>
<p>Given this background information ready, let's head back to my own lamp story...</p>
<p>Maybe some of you are aware that I had a trip to Europe a couple of months ago as I keep sharing my European trip photos via a little series of mine - the #myeuropaplog. When I planned this trip, I planned it with a Steem component - using Steemit to record my daily trip photos but keep the blogging time as short as possible so not to reduce the quality of the trip. I made an <a href="https://steemit.com/myeuropaplog/@deanliu/my-europa-photo-log-myeuropaplog-announcement-new-style-travelling-on-esteem-and-sbohem-muj-pritel">announcement </a>just before the trip started (and later <a href="https://steemit.com/contest/@deanliu/myeuropaplog-best-comment-makers-and-their-prizes-announced-a-total-of-14-steems">gave away some surprise gifts to many who commented</a>)...&nbsp;</p>
<p>We took the Emirates airline and the aircraft was A380 so we were very thrilled as we had never taken this huge carrier before. The flight starts from Taipei, makes a transfer in Dubai International Airport and then continues to Vienna (yeah, Europe!). We departed at midnight on a Monday so when we arrived at the DXB airport it was early morning already and we had 3 or 4 hours to spend in this airport before the connecting flight to Vienna. [See my DXB photos <a href="https://steemit.com/myeuropaplog/@deanliu/my-europa-plog-emirates-dxb-vie-and-hello-wien-hello-europe-2017510t4495586z">here</a>]</p>
<p>Of course we walked around and shopped around in this famous modern airport before we found some place to take a rest. I had never been to Dubai, but even just by saying the name of this city you can feel there seems to be some magic in it.. intriguing...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was pretty crazy about Steem at that time (well, actually was, has been, still is and will be so it seems) and had not yet toggled my mood to a traveler's, so when my wife was browsing through all those fancy international wines and marvelous local sweets, I was checking Steemit posts or some crypto-news beside her. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the magical moment arrived. I checked the price of Steem. It went up to more than $0.5 and continued to rise to over $1 in just a few hours (or 1-2 days I cannot recall)!! It was previously around $0.3 and actually I felt very pleased already because it wasn't long ago that Steem had just reached its historical low of $0.07...&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I couldn't believe my eyes because the price pumped like crazy back then when I was in transit. I seemed to message @oflyhigh and asked him what's happening... (please confirm if I did ask you) It was in that moment that I feel Steem is back on track and the story later proves me right until today. You might refer to the Steem price chart below from coinmarketcap.</p>
<p>https://steemitimages.com/DQmaWFNKzMzQRbmnspvAgD9GS3t9mcxcU1rAirQDnvM81Y6/%E8%9E%A2%E5%B9%95%E5%BF%AB%E7%85%A7%202017-08-05%20%E4%B8%8A%E5%8D%886.11.23.png</p>
<p>Well you can imagine that I felt so exuberant when my wife was shopping frantically in an airport thousand miles away from home! I had to distract myself from indulging in the unfounded over-joyfulness. So when I saw the Aladdin's lamp keychains on display (this is a popular theme for souvenirs of Dubai), I knew I need to get one of it to mark this moment.</p>
<p>Oh, there you go. I bought two delicate lamp keychains there and brought them back to Taiwan and took photos of them in Beitou. Aren't they gorgeous like the future of Steem? :)</p>
<p>Sometimes in some special moments of our lives, we need something concrete that you can feel in your hand or whatever makes you feel real to capture this very moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought these magical lamps to capture my little magical moment with Steem. And I hope they can witness what we are going to have in years to come. At that time, maybe I will auction one of them and keep one for myself... haha... Yeah, that's why I bought two.</p>
<p>End of my little story. I hope you enjoy it!</p>

<p>幾週前我發了下面這篇文章，文章最後說了要分享一個小故事，關於這兩只小神燈：</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/travel/@deanliu/travel-around-taiwan-hot-spring-in-beitou">🚉 [輕旅行系列] 北投，溫泉 🚉 [Travel Around Taiwan] Hot Spring in Beitou</a></p>
<p>所以，我這就來實現承諾了。尤其感謝 @rivalhw 跟 ＠nationalpark 兩位讀者在回覆表達了期待之意。</p>
<p>我想大家應該都很清楚什麼是阿拉丁神燈的故事了吧？應該不用我再說一遍。反正基本上如果你手上有這神燈，擦擦它，神燈精靈就會出現，給你三個願望！我想這故事應該全世界的大人們孩子們都很清楚的...</p>
<p>好！那就回到我的故事吧！</p>
<p>大概大家都知道我之前去了趟歐洲（哈哈，不好意思，搞得動靜很大），然後旅程中，以及回來後一直到現在，我都還持續在分享當時的照片，歐洲真是令人難以忘懷啊！當時我出發前還發了<a href="https://steemit.com/myeuropaplog/@deanliu/my-europa-photo-log-myeuropaplog-announcement-new-style-travelling-on-esteem-and-sbohem-muj-pritel">公告</a>，回來後還給許多回覆者發了<a href="https://steemit.com/contest/@deanliu/myeuropaplog-best-comment-makers-and-their-prizes-announced-a-total-of-14-steems">神秘獎</a>，這都在我 #myeuropaplog系列裡。</p>
<p>當時，我們特別選了Emirates航空，也是想搭乘一下傳說中的巨無霸客機A380，果然是很大啊，但沒法去二樓參觀，因為我們是經濟艙賤民，呵呵。飛機深夜從台北飛杜拜（迪拜），在那裡要待3-4小時，再轉機到維也納（噢！歐洲我來了！）。<a href="https://steemit.com/myeuropaplog/@deanliu/my-europa-plog-emirates-dxb-vie-and-hello-wien-hello-europe-2017510t4495586z">這裡</a>有些旅程的與杜拜機場的照片。</p>
<p>所以，當我們到杜拜機場時，大概已經是清晨了，但非常疲累因為飛機上不好睡。不過，我們都很興奮，因為從沒到過杜拜，而且後面要往歐洲更是期待！杜拜這城市，光是念它的名字，就會感到一股神奇的力量呀！好像背景就會響起阿拉伯的音樂呢！</p>
<p>我們在機場裡到處逛逛，有些商店都應該是開24小時的。先逛，再吃，再睡，然後去搭轉乘飛機。這就我們的計劃。</p>
<p>當時，我還在心繫Steem的模式，不能怪我，我常年處於這狀況，只是行前已經有做好心理準備，要轉換心境，成為旅人模式，否則不就白出來了嘛！但轉機時，還算還沒開始，我也還在想著旅程中該怎麼發照片又不佔用太多旅遊玩樂時間... 所以，當老婆在逛著商場，我就看著手機，跟著她走。經過琳琅滿目的世界名酒區，杜拜華麗豐富的甜點區，甚至是要抽獎的保時捷汽車，我都沒太大興趣，只是看看有趣...</p>
<p>神奇的時刻來了！我按往日習慣，又看了下Steem的價錢。竟然，升到了$0.5附近！而且還看似要一路漲上去！印象中那幾小時，還是後來1-2天之內，價格衝上$1以上，真是太瘋狂了！</p>
<p>當時其實我出發那幾天，已經對於回穩且上漲的Steem價格感到很欣慰了，大約是在$0.3上下，那已經是從再往前一陣子的歷史低點$0.07回升幾倍了！所以，我在杜拜機場，不太敢相信我的眼睛，我心想難道發生什麼事了嗎？似乎還傳了訊息給O小嬸，問他咋回事呢！（請確認一下啊！我有沒有問你啊？）他哪裡知道呀，成天搞程序的... &nbsp;只是傻笑吧！</p>
<p>那時，我感到不可置信，同時又有點香菇，想這段時間以來的堅持，終於似乎Steem看得到明亮的未來了... 你可以看看上面的歷史價格走勢圖，我在杜拜當時，就是那個大轉折向上，在那之前，其實已經回穩了。直到今天的故事，你已經都知道了...</p>
<p>所以，當老婆瘋狂採購時，我都傻笑地跟著付錢，在這離家千哩外的中東地區，果真是充滿神奇力量的地方啊！我稍微回神，覺得不能在耽溺在這種幻夢之中，畢竟前方還有許多荊棘啊！所以，我趕緊找找可以讓我分心的東西。此時就看到杜拜知名的神燈系列紀念品，心裡想就是這個了！挑了兩個可愛精緻的神燈鑰匙圈，以為此刻之紀念。之後，帶著它們到歐洲旅行，再帶回台灣，不小心放在背包裡帶到北投，就幫它們拍拍美照，今日來說說這小故事啦！：）</p>
<p>有時候，人生中總有些特別的時刻，我們需要進行一些行為來紀錄它，例如吃大餐，做瘋狂的事，或是，像我一樣，在當下買個東西，作為保存這時刻的實體。</p>
<p>這兩只小神燈，成為我捕捉這神奇時刻的載體，希望它們能夠持續跟我們一起，見證Steem光明的未來。</p>
<p>我買兩只，所以，等以後我們都發達了，說不定我再來拍賣一只，留一個在身邊當紀念？呵呵！</p></h6>
