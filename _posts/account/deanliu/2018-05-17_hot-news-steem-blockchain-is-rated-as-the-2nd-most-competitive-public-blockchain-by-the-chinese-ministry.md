After I read about this post by @kingscrown - [STEEM to be rated by China's Ministry!](https://steemit.com/steemit/@kingscrown/steem-to-be-rated-by-china-s-ministry), I tried to google more information and was surprised to find out that the result of the evaluation has just been released this morning!! (source in Chinese [here](http://www.sohu.com/a/231889123_115060))

What surprised me even more is that our beloved **Steem blockchain** is rated as the **SECOND** most competitive public blockchain with a total score of 115.9 among all candidates, including **Ethereum** (1st place), **Lisk** (3rd place), **NEO** (4th place), **Bitshares** (12) and **Bitcoin** (13) among others.

The first place is Ethereum without much surprise, but Steem is rated to be the most *technological capable* (with a score of 82.6!) blockchain of all due to its dPoS technology featuring higher throughput and fast transaction time. Wow!! Let's have a look of all the results: 

## <center>Global Public Chain Assessment Index</center>

<sub>*note: the 3rd to 5th column represent each chain's scores in **the technological capability, the usefulness of the application and the inattentiveness** respectively; the 6th column is the overall score and the last one is the ranking.*</sub>

The above table is from this Chinese news source:

[工信部发布首期全球公有链技术评估指数，以太坊排名首位](http://www.sohu.com/a/231889123_115060)

This evaluation is done by the **China Electronic Information Industry Development (CCID)** of the **Ministry of Industry and Information Technology** of the Chinese government and it has been announced that this index will be renewed every month since this very first round.

## *How exciting!! Isn't it!? Let's spread the news Steemians!!*
