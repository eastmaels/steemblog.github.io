<p>The key to what I state in the title is .... You have to believe that <em>Steem has a bright future</em>. If you don't, maybe this post isn't for you because the confidence is <em>all </em>that matters.</p>

<h1>A Simple Calculation on An Old Post</h1>
<p><br>
Okay, you are <em>still </em>reading! Great. Let me show you why. This morning when I was taking a little time out to re-live my old Steemit times (going though old posts and comments...), I saw this one with 100% SP - <a href="https://steemit.com/photography/@deanliu/luxury-hotel-series-regent-taipei-part-2-little-guests-and-good-morning-breakfast-part-2">the #2 of my [Luxury Hotel Series]</a> (which I haven't dished out even the second hotel yet.. lol). Out of curiosity, I decided to check how much it had earned for me. No, not the payout number shown below as - first, it <em>is </em>the total payout, not <em>the author's cut</em> and secondly, I wanted to know how much <strong>SPs </strong>(Steems in shareholder form) it had generated at that time.</p>
<p><em>[along this process I also discovered a </em><a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@deanliu/tips-for-steemians-how-to-keep-the-draft-of-your-old-post-on-steemit"><em>very useful tip</em></a><em> for blogging. you may check it </em><a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@deanliu/tips-for-steemians-how-to-keep-the-draft-of-your-old-post-on-steemit"><em>here </em></a><em>if interested]</em></p>

<p>Finding your reward from old posts isn't an easy task at all. Not possible on Steemit.com as I realized after trying that it only offers up to one month old reward record [correct me if I am wrong]. So, I try, as a muggle, to find other sources. Seems not possible on Steemd as it has too many transactions and no search function.</p>
<p><a href="https://steemdb.com/https://steemdb.com/">Steemdb.com</a> by @jesta seems to be my final hope? After I looked it up, <em><strong>bingo</strong></em>! It didn't let me down. Thanks again to these great developers! ... without whom, <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hermione_Granger">Hermione </a>can only be a pure muggle, not a witch. :)</p>
<p><strong>So I have got the number!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>With a total payout of <strong>$12.7</strong>. At that time, Steem price is about <strong>0.000157 btc</strong>, or <strong>$0.115 USD</strong>. Guess how many SPs did that post earn (<em>again, it is 100%SP post</em>)?</p>

<p></p><p>That means, in terms of today's price ($2.xx), that post has become a roughly <strong>$250</strong> post today!!&nbsp;Wow!!</p></h3></center>
<h1>Steem Roller Coaster, Anyone!?</h1>
<p><br>
So, what's wrong with <em>low </em>Steem price!? If you have faith and the commitment to it. As I said above, all that matters is your faith and endurance. $12 post at that time wasn't anything special (but I have been and still am grateful), not special today as well. But it is so precious to have generated so many Steems for them to grow later until today. This is the <strong>magic </strong>of <em>time </em>and <em>crytocurrency</em>. I think.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steem price is like the <em>roller coaster ride</em>. Up and downs are <em>normal </em>rather than <em>exceptions</em>. You don't need to be a trader to profit, you might lose big. Just hang on and enjoy anything you <em>see </em>and <em>feel </em>during the journey. <strong>Don't get off</strong>. This is once a life time opportunity. No matter how others might be gaming the system, secretly robbing the rewards, or earning disproportional rewards ... <em>let it be</em>. It's the reflection of our versatile world. Focus on <em>yourself</em>. Earn $1 today, it might become $100 tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>As long as you believe, during this crazy ride. fun, is't it?</strong></p>

<p>As Steem price grows back to its old level, it might goes <em><strong>up</strong></em>. To the moon yeah!! Or <em><strong>down </strong></em>to the hell again. But what I have shown is that we don't have to be sad, we should even <em>embrace </em>it. As long as you have what? _____ ! &nbsp;Yes, you've got that. :)</p>
<p><strong>$0.... $4! ... $3 $2 $1 ........ $0.5 ...... $0.3.......$0.1!! ... $0.07!! OMG</strong></p>
<p><strong>.... &nbsp;$0.1.. $0.2.. $0.5... $1!... $2!! OMG ....&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h1>Keep Your Faith and Let Time Do the Trick</h1>
<p><br>
As a mundane and ordinary blogger/muggle like me, you can just let TIME be your friend and let it do its magic. Keep <em>blogging</em>, <em>commenting</em>, <em>interacting</em>, <em>curating</em>, <em>networking </em>and <em>learning </em>... Don't worry about the price. The price is the <em><strong>value discovery process</strong></em> for outsiders. If you have already discovered its value and believe in it, then leave the discovery activity (aka price) to others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be rewarded by all kind of <em>true values</em> - <em>friendship</em>, <em>knowledge</em>, <em>freedom </em>and yes, <em>monetary income</em>. Sometimes, you'll just have to wait. It ain't feel like waiting at all to me. Almost a year for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, thanks for listening to my mumbo jumbos! I hope somehow someone out there is reading and benefit from it so my reward is justified. Tell you a secret - I am not gonna sell it anytime soon...&nbsp;</p><p>
