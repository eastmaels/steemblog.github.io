Tonight I had the privilege to meet with a bunch of great Japanese Steemians at Shiodome Tokyo. Thanks to @kinakomochi, who is the community manager of Steemit JP, for setting this meetup for me [previous announcement is [here](https://steemit.com/japanese/@steemit-jp/4acdsg-10-14-meetup) and [here](https://steemit.com/japanese/@kinakomochi/meet-up)] and thanks to @yoshiko @kayoko @yasu24 @ytrphoto @tamito0201 for joining. You guys are really awesome! And I did not say this because you pay for my alcohol and food ^o^

We met at this place at 7pm - **UOKIN PICCOLO Êñ∞Ê©ãÂ∫óÔºà„Ç¶„Ç™„Ç≠„É≥„Éî„ÉÉ„Ç≥„É≠Ôºâ** and it's really great for me to experience this *Izakaya* culture with the locals because I cannot speak Japanese and this time I travel with my son so it's not possible to bring a child here (thanks to my wife for taking care of him while I joined meetup). The place was packed and the energy was high.

The amazing thing about Steemian Meetups is that you never have to worry about what to talk about ... we do have *a lot* of common topics and even know many common friends who we even have not met yet! Also, it won't feel weird when you take out your phone to take photo of the food!! Haha! We are all *bloggers* and that's what we do - sharing our life experience! Although we might not had communicated very smoothly, it was definitely one memorable night full of laughter and sincerity for me. 

I think I might have expressed the notion that I don't want to expose my personal images before meeting up, so they were very thoughtful and did not ask me for photos together. Still, I asked my Steemit substitute to take a photo with @yoshiko holding a Steemit banner ... This lady is allegedly the mastermind behind the Steemit-jp conglomerate ... She can do anything, really. ^_^

The other lady @kayoko sat in front of me. She was very kind to help everyone with tonight's food. She uses knifes very professionally that a fish was dissected in no time. You don't want to mess up with her.... lol

@kinakomochi is like the big brother of the group and takes care of everything. He is also very cheerful and easygoing person. Kind of like my first Japanese Steemian friend. Kudos to you, man!

@tamito0201 sat next to me and he told me that he only joined Steemit a month ago! He is a stylish dude with a low-keyed sense of humor. Cool.

@yasu24 seems to be a quieter guy who don't talk much. But when we called it a night and walked to the metro station, Yasu and I talked a lot along the way and realized that we know many people in common like @htliao, @justyy and @travelgirl... etc and I was quite surprised to know his passion for this community! I was also moved that he told me he had to spend 2 hours in transit tonight just to join this meetup! Thanks Yasu!

@ytrphoto, another enthusiastic and energetic Steemian! He seems to know a lot of people, including in the crypto sphere and knows a lot of things! He loves to blog about food and really loves coffee. So he recommend me some places to visit while I am in Tokyo... Like the following.. Thanks Yotaro!

Cannot thank you all enough for giving me such a unforgettable night! This is my first ever overseas Steemian Meetup so it means something to me. Hope to see you really soon! ‚ù§Ô∏èÔΩûÔΩû

*this **Dean's Tokyo Snapshots** series ( #dean-tokyo as a specific tag) is my photographic diary for my family trip to Tokyo. Due to busy schedule and a naughty boy with us, I won't be able to write much but I will make sure that every photo that I choose means something, at least to me... I hope you enjoy this photo series as well as me! Feel free to comment but I probably won't have much time making replies often. Apologies first. :p*

***follow me @deanliu if you haven't! or not, if this does not interest you...^^***
