<p>Normally I do not post on internet memes but I had done once before when PPAP was hot. Today would be my second time doing this. The reason is similar ... <em>just can't resist the desire to share</em> with more people! Besides, this song is about <em>chicken </em>and when is a better time to share this at the beginning of the Year of Chicken!?</p>

<p>This is a new song by&nbsp;Takeo Ischi, a 69 years old Japanese singer/yodeler active in Germany. You can check the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeo_Ishii">wiki</a>, but it doesn't really matter who he is, right... okay, here is the song titled ...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>!!! &nbsp;Chicken Attack &nbsp;!!!</strong></p>
<p>It is a English song by a Japanese singer in Germany with the theme of Chicken, animal of the year for Chinese. Sounds international enough? Not only so, it has so many things in it:<strong> </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yodeling"><strong>yodeling</strong></a><strong> singing</strong> (I learn this term for the first time), <strong>environmentalism</strong>, <strong>animal rights</strong>, <strong>justice</strong>, <strong>martial arts</strong>, <strong>humor</strong> ... and most important of all ... it sounds great and addictive!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is just so inspirational and positive that I decide to <em><strong>Chicken Attack</strong></em> you!! Now, watch out and take it !</p>

<p><strong>If you really like it like really really like it... then here is a 10 hour version for you :)</strong></p>

<p>[CN version]</p>
<p>通常我不太轉網路上的這些meme，很久以前因為PPAP而寫過一次，但這次又忍不住了。這次是聽到日本旅德的 “約德爾唱法” (yodeling)歌手，69歲的石井健雄新推出的歌曲《Chicken Attach》，實在是非常迷幻，勵志、深刻、詼諧，重點是真的好聽會上癮，在這雞年的開始，真是非常應景的一首好音樂啊！歌詞表面看也是很搞笑， 老歌手在歌曲最後的超強7段轉音也很精采，娛樂性也十足，難怪會瘋傳！</p>
<p>上面<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8CIZgEppnU">第一個連結</a>是正常版本，第二個是10小時<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9eI40RNoQ">馬拉松版本</a>，果然夠瘋！:)</p>
