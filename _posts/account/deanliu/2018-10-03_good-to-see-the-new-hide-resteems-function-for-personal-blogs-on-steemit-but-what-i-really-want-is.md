This morning, I found a little bit change to my Steemit blog -  there is a surprise two words "**Hide Resteems**" in turquoise above my blog articles ...

Once you click it, your blog (or whosever blog) will be switched into *No resteem* mode and hence showing "**Show all**" if you want to switch back to original mode.

I have to say that this is a looooong-awaited function, so I am glad (of course, some other UIs or Steem-Apps already have this function but I am still quite addicted to Steemit.com). Thank you the Steemit team for finally bring this function to us users... (*update: I just saw a [resteem](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@eonwarped/utopian-filter-resteem-from-user-blog) from @timcliff and maybe we should thank @eonwarped instead!*)

However, regarding Resteems, IMHO, what I really need, as compared to the above change, is ....

<h3>A Feed with Resteems filter!</h3>

Yes, I need this filter function on my feed, more than on my (or other's) personal blog!! So I am a bit disappointed to find out that this is still missing after I saw the above change.

I love my friends, I follow them, so that means I have to tolerate whatever they post, or I can always choose to un-follow. But I don't need to love their judgement on what to resteem for his/her friends (me included!). Some friends really resteem a lot, especially within a short time frame, and when that happens, my feed will be clogged with all resteems from one single person that I follow.

Obviously I don't like that. But I don't want to un-follow that person as well since I still want to know what s/he wants to say/post... 

So there you go - my **feed** becomes useless and it becomes a list for '*someone that I have interests*' only. 

**I hope a resteem filter on feed will be available soon... that way, my friends can resteem as many articles as they want and I won't be bothered!**

Do you think so too, Steemians!?
