<h2>Bet with Me</h2>
<p>My previous "Bet with Me" went ... great in terms of post payout, but better luck next time for my dear participants! Check this one... The bet is lost but the post hasn't ended...&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/sports/@deanliu/bet-nba-finals-with-me-three-8-steems-prizes-up-for-grabs-if-cavs-wins-2-and-you-got-lucky">Bet NBA Finals with Me - THREE "8 Steems" Prizes Up for Grabs If Cavs Wins #2 And You Got Lucky!!</a></p>
<p>You can consider support it while you can, not to benefit me ... Because ... to let you know a little secret: I will still offer each of them something after I calculate the final income and costs... (they don't know it yet.. :D but I take care of those who engage in activities held by me as always ...) &nbsp;But this doesn't mean that I will do the same for this one... Who knows maybe this one got heavily flagged... LOL</p>

<h2>Make it Bigger This Time!! Roland Garros x NBA</h2>
<p>Okay, today I witnessed the lost of my beloved <a href="http://www.nba.com/warriors/">Warriors</a> but I am not sad because they can bounce back any time in their home games. <a href="https://steemit.com/sports/@deanliu/bet-nba-finals-with-me-three-8-steems-prizes-up-for-grabs-if-cavs-wins-2-and-you-got-lucky">My previous post</a> bet on Cavs to win, remember!? LOL ... As I had said...</p>
<blockquote><em>Its Odds is Good!!&nbsp;</em></blockquote>
<p>This time the odds are even higher: <strong>3.5</strong>!! They played pretty solid today, as home team yes... but still... It's a good price! So go for it again!</p>

<p><em>[</em><a href="https://nba.udn.com/nba/news/"><em>source</em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>But I am not satisfied. I want to bring bigger prize for my participants!! So I decide to combine (sorry I don't the the terms for it) the also hot sports final at the moment .... The <a href="http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/index.html">Roland Garros Grand Slam</a> Tennis Final!!</p>
<p>The truth is... I am also a tennis fan for a long long time... Federer is probably my top favorite. But I also love so many of them... Nadal, Djokovic and even Wawrinka, just to name a few... And this time, the men's final comes down to <strong>Nadal</strong> vs <strong>Wawrinka</strong>!! <em><strong>What an exciting and historical encounter</strong></em>!! If you have followed this year's Roland Garros, you know that the Nadal we used to know is back!! Com'on!! Should I bet on him, the (old) king of clay?? Again, the same logic applies... it is the odds that matters!! So N:W=1.1:4.0 ?? No way!! You can <em>not</em> write off Wawrinka at 4.0!!&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>[</em><a href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/"><em>source</em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>Okay then, easy choice for me... Go for Wawrinka to win and then Cavaliers to win (both must hold), then I can enjoy the odds of 3.5*4= 14!! <strong>What an odds</strong>!! That's it! That's how I am gonna create <strong>BIG PRIZE</strong> for my participants!! :)</p>
<p><strong>See my sports lottery under!!</strong></p>

<h2>Game Rules - join soon or you will not qualify!</h2>
<p>As you can see that I bought <strong>NT250</strong> for both Wawrinka and Cavs to win. If I win, I will have NT$3250 (3500-250) or roughly &nbsp;<strong>$105 USDs</strong> net profit and I would like to share all with anyone who join my little game!! :) Here are the rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Prizes</strong>: <strong>ONE TOP PRIZE of "$100 USDs"</strong> and <strong>One second prize of "$10 USDs"</strong>!! [<em>Only when this bet wins</em>]&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Participation</strong>: No need to upvote the main post. JUST <strong>UPVOTE</strong> THE "<em><strong>Wawrinka Wins and Cavs Conquers</strong></em>" <strong>COMMENT</strong> OF MINE. Please make sure that you UPVOTE WITH A WEIGHT OF <strong>MORE THAN 50%</strong>. Of course, you have to do so <strong>BEFORE THE ROLAND GARROS GAME</strong> starts (Still one whole day left to join!!) That's it! upvote the comment with more than 50% weight before the big tennis game and you are in.&nbsp;[If Wawrinka <em>does</em> win and you joined <em>after</em> this but before the NBA #5 final starts, technically speaking you should still deserve some chance, but I am not sure if that is easy to calculate so please join early]</li>
  <li><strong>Announcement</strong>: Winners will be announced a few days after the bet outcome is confirmed (I hope this has to wait until the NBA Final #5 is over). Only eligible participants will enter the <em><strong>random</strong></em> drawing if we are luck to secure both wins. And we will. :)&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Note</strong>: If either Wawrinka or Cavs loses, then this game is <strong>OFF</strong>. I will lost $8 but luckily with post income to cover it if lucky. But I do hope Stan and Cavs can bring surprises so you get to have a shot at <strong>THE BIG PRIZE</strong>!! &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
