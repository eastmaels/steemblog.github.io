<h3>I used to share some restaurants that I had and now I think it is a good time to keep doing this. One because I would like to introduce great foods in Taiwan to the world and secondly I can keep my food log online as well. And I intend to start the title of this kind of posts with "My Food Log.... ". :) &nbsp;[experimenting a little bit with a similar tag as well]</h3>
<h3>Actually I have done two relevant posts lately:</h3>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/food/@deanliu/lunch-today-after-going-to-a-future-commerce-show-liao-s-lamb-thick-soup-at-back-station-2017428t13315142z">Lunch today after going to a future commerce show - Liao's lamb thick soup at back station</a></p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/travel/@deanliu/a-review-of-din-tai-fung-steemitblogs-and-about-its-first-store">A Review of Din Tai Fung steemitblogs and about its FIRST store</a></p>
<h3>For the 2nd one, you must have known that Din Tai Fung is famous for its steamed soup dumplings (Xiao Lung Bao). But... be that as it may, you definitely have many more choices in Taipei - the city of Chinese cuisines.&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>So today I am gonna let you know one great place to have xiaolungbaos - Jin Din Rou. It is already famous among Japanese tourists who may be have too much DTF so they want a fresh new choice for these little evil dumplings....&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Me and my wife went there a few weeks ago. And we have to say - yes, it is not inferior to DTF in terms of food quality.</h3>
<h3>Jin Din Rou is located in the busy streets of Chungshan district, at the back door business strips of the Regent Hotel Taipei, which accommodates a lot of foreign tourists, especially from Japan. It looks like this:</h3>

<h3>If you think you can just enter the gate and look for a seat, well, most of the time, you cannot. You will be guided to go to the building next door, yeah, the one at the left with a green elevator but you can just walk to the 2nd floor. Follow that blue sign.</h3>

<h3>There you are. It doesn't look fancy like Din Tai Fung and even a little bit too simple.</h3>

<h3>But... who cares!? We are here for the food!! See!? They DON'T CARE!! :)</h3>

<h3>So we had our table. Hot tea, ginger shreds (for those dumplings of course!) and nice tableware ...&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>What we had that day are: xiaolungbao of course, fried rice (you can roughly judge its chef simply from this dish), sour and spicy soup, fried vegetables, mapo tofu, wined chicken and some beer!! &nbsp;</h3>

<h6><p>各位好，決定重拾過去傳統，多發發美食文章，然後試試以 #myfoodlog 來當標籤。很多人都知道台灣小籠包，但都只知道鼎泰豐，難不成台灣只有鼎泰豐嗎？其實好吃的小籠包店還是很多的，今天就跟大家分享這家－京鼎樓。京鼎樓是在晶華商圈，在晶華酒店後門附近，所以這間店在日本旅客中應該已經小有名聲了，畢竟晶華酒店是日客聚集地啊！</p>
<p>到了店門，多半你要被帶到隔壁的2樓去用餐的，可能是生意太好，只好在隔壁租空間來當餐廳吧！我們當天點了小籠包、醉雞、炒青菜、酸辣湯、麻婆豆腐、炒飯，還叫了點啤酒，瞧瞧，看起來好吃吧？印象中，幾乎每樣都不錯，甚至我個人覺得他的小籠包不輸給鼎泰豐，但比較便宜。炒飯、醉雞這些都是考驗功力的餐點，都一一過關！店內到用餐時間就幾乎客滿，甚至他們也開始賣起自製鳳梨酥！</p>
<p>鼎泰豐有湯姆克魯斯，這間店也有楊紫瓊！廚房有一部分也是透明公開的，似乎賣小籠包的都必須這樣了.... &nbsp;下次到台北，可以來嚐嚐。旁邊還有一間雞家莊，也很棒，下次我再分享囉！</p>
