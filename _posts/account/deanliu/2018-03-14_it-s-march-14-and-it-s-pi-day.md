Steemians! It's [Pi Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day) today! Yes, the number that you are very familiar and maybe afraid? 

[π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi), the ***ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter*** and ... whatever, anyway it's a very important mathematical constant that is very important to some smart people that we don't really know.

Not to be confused with [National Pie Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Pie_Day) of USA though... It's on Jan 23.

We bitcoiners should be more familiar with pies right? I don't need to include any link here since you should all know those two .... oh no,... not pie, it's pizzas! Damn it! (BTW, May 22nd is Bitcoin Pizza Day!) Anyhow, pies, pizzas ... all are round shapes and therefore perfectly associated with π. 

I saw Taiwan's Google search page becomes the picture above so I know these all. 

And by the way, Mar 14 is also [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)'s birthday. For Asians, Mar 14 is also widely known as the [White Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Day), which is the reverse of Valentine's Day and ladies give (white) chocolates as expression of love to the gentlemen they like. 

### Such a romantic and intelligent day, right!?

However, for the crypto community, today, from the very search engine above, news has it ...

[**Google says it will ban cryptocurrency ads**](http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/14/technology/business/google-bans-cryptocurrency-ads-bitcoin/index.html)
