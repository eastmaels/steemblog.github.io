<h3>Post the news here so more can see...&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>A few paragraphs quoted ...</h3>
<blockquote>Decentralized social media platform <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/steem">Steemit</a> has announced a new marketing direction and the launch of a “crowdsourced growth” initiative.In a press release, CEO Ned Scott announced that Mitchell Loureiro as vice president of marketing would help in “taking Steemit from a crypto-centric project to a household name.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“By leveraging the wisdom of the crowd to amplify and multiply the impact of marketing efforts we’ll build out countless sub-communities, each incentivized to grow until we join the ranks of the social media giants,” Scott added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We believe that the only way Steem growth can scale is for it to come from the community itself. So we’re going to create community-driven growth processes from the very start. That’s right everyone, <strong>we’re crowdsourcing growth for Steem</strong>.” [<em>emphasis added by deanliu</em>]</blockquote>
