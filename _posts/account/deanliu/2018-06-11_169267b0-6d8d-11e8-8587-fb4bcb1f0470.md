Two weeks ago, we took our kid to a park named **Rainbow Riverside Park (彩虹河濱公園)** near the Songshan Station (松山車站). In this video, I recorded most of our walk to and returning from the park. We did not find any rainbow, in the sky or on the ground. It's weird. But anyway we had enjoyed the scenery and views along the way - including cyclers, joggers, little baseball players, ... a river, Taipei 101 on the horizon, and occasionally airplanes taking off from the nearby airport... *It was quite relaxing* ...

LOVE? Well, you'll have to watch the video to find out! ^_^

The following map shows our path from the station to the park.
