Dear DLivers and Steemians,

This is my first DLive video and it was a live stage show performed by the famous [**Paper Windmill Theater**](http://www.paperwindmill.com.tw/) for children in Taiwan. We were excited when we knew that they were going to perform *for free* in Da-An forest park in the Taipei city and that was my son's first Paper Windmill show as well as mine and my wife's first. PWT has been there for Taiwan's kids for more than 20 years! Yes, 20 years full of laughter and love. Finally, we the grownups knew what's this all about and we were all deeply moved - laugh to tears and moved to tears at the same time of course... ^_^

"Wu-Song Fights the Tiger" is a famous Chinese folklore, in which heroic Wu-Song helps the villagers get ride of the ferocious tiger in the mountains. Of course PWT adapted the story to be one with love and joy and of course the tiger becomes a cutie and loved by all! Watch the video! Although it's in Chinese, I am sure that you can feel the vibe too!!
