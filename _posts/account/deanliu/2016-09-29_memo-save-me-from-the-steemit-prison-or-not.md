<p><strong>Yeah. I am in prison, according to this page... LOL</strong></p>

<p><strong>Please save me. Which prison? Of course the Steemit prison (beta). It quite describes my current situation - I am truly locked up by this platform. Need to escape. No physical walls. It's me who wants to be locked away.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Memo it just for fun. Keep steeming, inmates!</strong></p>
