**Amanoya**'s Japanese style sandwich. Ouch! Probably the best sandwich I have ever had in my life... I am not sure if I have to eat it a hundred times will I still feel the same but that was what I thought when I ate it... Egg moisturized layer in the middle is the key to ultimate taste, I think.

^^Cream Waffle of **Ginza Manneken Waffle** and my personal favorite is the flavor of rum and raisins. Insanely delicious.

Last, is a great taste from Hokkaido. There is a Hokkaido Specialty Center near Yurakucho station in Tokyo and here has a lot of Goodies of Japan outside Tokyo! One thing you cannot take home is this - the melon flavor ice cream!! Oh, man... that is really good and I went there to have a cone of ice cream of melon flavor every time I visited Tokyo. Every time.

Definitely a good place to spend your large quantity of Japanese coins. ^_^

*this **Dean's Tokyo Snapshots** series ( #dean-tokyo as a specific tag) is my photographic diary for my family trip to Tokyo. Due to busy schedule and a naughty boy with us, I won't be able to write much but I will make sure that every photo that I choose means something, at least to me... I hope you enjoy this photo series as well as me! Feel free to comment but I probably won't have much time making replies often. Apologies first. :p*

***follow me @deanliu if you haven't! or not, if this does not interest you...^^***
