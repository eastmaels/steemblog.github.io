Not me. It's my wife and son who are currently travelling in Europe.

Yeah, my wife sent me some photos last weekend (see below) about a Bitcoin ATM (in some places, they are called **BTM**, i.e. ***Bitcoin Teller Machine***). She knows that I am crazy about these cryptocurrencies and I have been talking these alien things to her in the past year. 

I was excited to see those photos, but did not ask her for more details (I am pretty sure she did not use it as she has never handled any *coins* before) because I know it's quite stressful travelling with a 5 years old boy alone in a foreign country (*who the fxck has time to answer your trivial questions about this stupid machine! you should be thankful that I had time to take these photos and sent them to you already*... I imagine^^)

Well, I have Google to help me. So, I soon found out that this machine belongs to a Czech startup company **WBTCB**, *World BTC Business*. Here is their [website](https://www.wbtcb.com/en/).

I have also found a story on coindesk back in 2014 about this company:

Based on the info from the website, I tried to locate the Bitcoin ATM my wife ran into. Turns out it's inside a shopping center called Omega that Google Map doesn't have a direct street view, but I can still imagine from the bird's eye view. ^_^

This reminds me of my previous encounter with BTMs ... Also in Europe and it was my first time! ^_^

I visited Prague last year, but have never been to Brno, a city that I can only associated with [Milan Kundera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Kundera). Now, since I have known that they have a bitcoin machines there, suddenly this city seems a lot friendlier to me now... lol
