## Hunter's comment
Impressive technology by XROUND Inc.! Traditionally, voice enhancement technology is limited to 2D and with their patented algorithm, they manage to simulate the sound in a 3D way and create a surrounding ambience!! 

What's more amazing is that you only need to stick to your original speakers or earphones and connect them with **XPUMP** and you get to enjoy the sound effect of a cinema's!! It would be really great for listening to music or playing computer games and etc... See the Gif above and you get the idea!!

Currently they are crowdfunding the upgraded version **XPUMP PREMIUM**on Taiwan's leading site flyingV [link here](https://www.flyingv.cc/projects/18733) ... Here is an introductory video to show you how it works:
