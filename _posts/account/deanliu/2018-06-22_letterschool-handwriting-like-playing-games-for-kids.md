## Hunter's comment
This is really a COOL App for parents! From my own parenting experience, for non-native English speaking places, if you want your kids to learn English well, the key secret is to let him/her familiarize or live, even better, the alphabets!! So they will find playing with these letters is interesting and fun!

LetterSchool is an ideal App for this purpose. Toddlers and preschoolers can ***tap, trace and write*** letters and numbers in game-like settings so learning is just equivalent to playing! Kids get to learn how to pronounce their little **shape friends** at the same time while playing with it.

The idea is simple and it works great on kids. Check out this video to get the feeling of it:

Definitely a cool product for parents of little kids.

For [iOS](https://app.adjust.com/vgi1n9) [Do use iPad for your kids!]
