Last night I took some time to reconsider my witness votes and I had not changed my votes for at least more than half an year! Recently I saw some voices urging Steemians to vote for witness as this activity is so fundamentally important like casting votes to democracy... So, I decided to do it when I have time and last night I did.

The main changes I made to my votes are - 1) removing some inactive witnesses (wow, there were *A LOT*! sorry for keeping those inactive votes for so long~~~); 2) voting for new (*relatively*) witnesses from the CN community, especially for ***Partiko***, an amazing Steem mobile UI; 3) voting for someone I know that started witness job *after* my last vote adjustment (like @kevinwong)

The biggest difference between this voting and last voting is that .... wow! **now I *almost* all have good reasons for voting someone as a witness of Steem** and that's something I did not have before - I vote for those who *looks* like influential users or just famous, most likely just because they were sitting at the top 20 places. This change is really great and it means that now I have a deep enough understanding of the platform and I can make it better with my limited own Steem Powers. How cool is that?

It seems I still have two spots available that I have not yet figured out whom to vote. Not a big SP holder, but feel free to recommend anyone to me. 

**Review your own witness list now if you haven't done it for a long time! ^^**

昨晚我想到一件待辦之事：重新檢視我的見證人名單。主要是，我真的太久沒有更動了！然後，一直惦記著要去投Partiko一票的（順便把 @skenan給XX了） ... 終於昨晚想到又剛好有空，於是就花了一些時間來檢視一下。哇！看到很多我投的已經不活躍的見證人，真是太不好意思了，浪費許多票～～

主要更動如下：1) 去除不活躍見證人（不活躍不投也不會不好意思了）；2) 把中文區見證人都投了（有漏請跟我說）；3) 捕投一些新出現的見證人

最大的感觸是，以前投見證人都是胡亂投，看人家有名或是排行榜靠前就投，其實都不太認識。這一次，最大的驚喜就是，我幾乎投每個見證人都知道為什麼理由，哇，這感覺真好，代表我更了解這平台，也更知道要如何投票讓它更往我希望的目標去～～

最後，還剩下兩個位置，歡迎提出投票建議喔（<del>O哥別再懶了，快跳進來吧</del>）！（**開心！！昨晚得知大神又重回前20見證人，似乎對於Steem的信心又提升了不少呢！**）

**如果你還沒投票，或是很久沒調整，趕緊去投吧！為Steem發展盡一份力量！^^**
