<h2><strong>August 8</strong> </h2>
<p>is celebrated as Father's Day in Taiwan. @magicmonk 's <a href="https://steemit.com/life/@magicmonk/happy-father-s-day-to-my-dad-08-08-is-father-s-day-in-taiwan-because-8-is-pronounced-as-ba-which-is-dad#@deanliu/re-magicmonk-happy-father-s-day-to-my-dad-08-08-is-father-s-day-in-taiwan-because-8-is-pronounced-as-ba-which-is-dad-20160808t051740618z">88card</a> reminds me that I actually started my very first Steemit self-introduction (didn't use the popular introduceyourself tag as I did know back then) post with a title &quot;<a href="https://steemit.com/introduction/@deanliu/a-father-from-taiwan-thinking-introducing-myself-a-bit">A father from Taiwan. thinking ...</a> &quot;. And that was just 3 weeks ago!  [<em>note. about father's day, you can check a reply </em><a href="https://steemit.com/life/@magicmonk/happy-father-s-day-to-my-dad-08-08-is-father-s-day-in-taiwan-because-8-is-pronounced-as-ba-which-is-dad#@deanliu/re-magicmonk-happy-father-s-day-to-my-dad-08-08-is-father-s-day-in-taiwan-because-8-is-pronounced-as-ba-which-is-dad-20160808t051740618z"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em>] </p>
<p>So, I decided to make two posts today (hence part 1 &amp; 2. link to the counterpart at the end of this post) - first one is here to show the son's work. and the second one is to show the dad's creation 3 years ago. This was supposed to be in my diary. But since there is no such type of post (see <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@deanliu/post-should-have-different-properties-in-the-future-not-just-with-its-content-tagged">my proposal on post types here</a>), I have to make it funnier (or... <em><strong>more scary?!</strong></em>) so that it brings value to you. Here is the part 1.</p>
<h2><strong>Ethan's Killer Whale!</strong></h2>
<p>My wife and I took Ethan (my 3 years old son) to a department store yesterday (Sunday) and we let him take a roughly 1-hour 'course' for modeling some cute figures with playdough (the store is the <a href="http://www.k-kingdom.com.tw/" rel="noopener">K-Kingdom</a> in case you visit Taipei next time with kids and this session costs about 30 US dollars). Ethan had finished two works with instructions from a young lady from the store. He was so intrigued and focused that he barely say anything so we the parents get to take a short break from babysitting - I stayed with him and read some good articles about bitcoins and his mother went for a little shopping. Everybody was happy. </p>
<p>Although the true value of Ethan's activity lies in creating optimized time allocation for everyone, his works symbolize this happy result. So, I am gonna share with you here one of his works - the killer whale!! (<em>No, I did not pick the whale by my steemwashed mind, </em><em>at least not from my consciousness level</em><em>.</em>) </p>
<p>Be prepared.....  <strong>Ethan's Killer Whale</strong> is coming to get you!!</p>

<p>I hope that you are not too scared by this intimadating picture. Actually, please refer to the wikipedia for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whale" rel="noopener">a scientific introduction on killer whales</a>.<em> Quote: &quot;Wild killer whales are not considered a threat to humans&quot;</em>... And I especially like this one: &quot;<em><strong>Killer whales are highly social</strong></em>&quot;. So, please, enough about the mambo jambo about whales consuming all the resources. They won't hurt us..... or,... hmm... would they? whales, please upvote to show goodwill... </p>
<p>Okay, back to Ethan's formidable creature. Personally I think it looks like another formidable creature from Japan TV/comics - the<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjOvth3O2Vs" rel="noopener"><strong>Ultraman</strong></a>!! whose creator also brings the montrous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkcfB3z0_-0" rel="noopener"><strong>GODZILLA</strong></a>! You can see all the scaryness across them.</p>

<p>Too scary?! Please don't get mad. I come in peace. Don't want to scare anyone. Whales are peaceful (whales, please upvote to show goodwill...). And... the Ultraman... if you know its translated Chinese name used in Taiwan actually means &quot;<strong>salty egg superman</strong>&quot; (the big eyes explains why), you probably won't be scared too much. </p>
<p>Again, apology if you think this post is suitable for kids and show it to them and they got scared. We don't have rating/censorship here at Steemit. It's partly not my fault.</p>
<p>Should you accept this apology. Please continue to check the counterpart post here:  <a href="https://steemit.com/cuisine/@deanliu/blah-blah-blah-on-ba-ba-father-s-day-part-2-dad-s-creation"><strong>Blah Blah Blah on Ba Ba Father's Day - Part 2 – Dad's creation</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Last, a photo showing where and how he made his creation. And no, I am not gonna show you the girlie playdough cake he made (he actually spent more time on this one).</p>
