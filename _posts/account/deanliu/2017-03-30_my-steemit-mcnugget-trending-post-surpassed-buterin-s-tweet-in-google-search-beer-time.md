<p><strong>Check my post two days ago here<br>
</strong>https://steemit.com/mcnugget/@deanliu/you-would-have-to-turn-a-chicken-mcnugget-into-a-chicken-to-be-able-to-hack-it-buterin-quoting-tapscott-on-twitter<br>
<br>
To my surprise, when I, out of curiosity, tried to google that Tapscott's quote, I found out that my post (not exactly my post but close enough) on Steemit actually ranks higher than Buterin's original tweet!!<br>
<br>
How come!? Is it the power of Steemit too strong that it will push anything published here to top ranking spots in Google? I don't get it... Maybe someone with technical background can answer this question...<br>
<br>

<h3>But, for now, I am gonna celebrate with my meme buddy with beers!!</h3><br>
