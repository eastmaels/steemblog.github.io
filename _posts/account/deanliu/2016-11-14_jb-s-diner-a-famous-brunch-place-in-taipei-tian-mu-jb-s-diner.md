<p><strong>Last time I introduced a un-traditional market in Tian Mu. On that day, we actually had a great brunch nearby in a also very famous brunch restaurant of Taipei. Let me also share it with you today.</strong></p>
<p><strong>上次我們去了天母士東市場探險。當天我們去之前，是在一家非常有名的早午餐餐廳吃得非常滿足後才去的。今天就跟大家也分享一下這家餐廳與餐點吧！</strong></p>

<p><strong>JB's Diner is one of the amazing brunch places in Taipei, a western-style restaurant serving diner style food (breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner) all day long. They're located in the heart of the Tian Mu area of Taipei behind Shinkong Mitsukoshi deparment store. According to some bloggers, JB's Diner has that classic American Diner food but less greasy and more on the healthy side. Their food has very large portion and the price is considered cheap for the quality and quantity you are getting.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The following photo was shot from their 2F - the main dining area. As you can see they have a great view outside the window.</strong></p>
<p><strong>JB’s Diner是台北天母一間非常知名的早午餐餐廳，主要餐點是美式餐點，全天候從早餐到晚餐時段都提供。位於天母新光三越百貨旁巷子內。餐點份量很大，價格並不特別貴，因此人氣十足，假日一定要訂位，否則可能要等很久。以下是從二樓主要用餐區拍攝的窗景，可以看到用餐區有很棒的視野，氣氛非常輕鬆愉快。</strong></p>

<p><strong>This is 1F with limited seats but the sign says it all: “ EAT HERE - Satisfying Your Hunger “ To me this decoration is very American style. If you prefer bar seats and wanna talk to the chef, stay here. Most customers go upstairs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>一樓只有有限的吧台座位，如果你一個人來，想找廚師服務生聊聊天，可以考慮坐這裡，但是大部分客人都會上樓，二樓才是主要座位區。一樓的裝飾很美式，簡潔的招牌寫著 “ EAT HERE - Satisfying Your Hunger “ 簡單，明瞭。</strong></p>

<p><strong>We orederd three sets of brunch for only my wife and me. Not because we eat a lot but for we rarely come to Tian Mu and this restaurant is famous so we (actually just my wife who likes to try new things) just order more if needed. Here we go. The first one is the classic American burger - See the big juicy chunk of beef in the burger, magnificant pickles, tomato slice and lettuce and the famous JB fires with cheese and some bacon … Really… worry about losing weight later and just have a BIG bite!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>我們兩人點了三放早午餐，不是我們吃得多，而是因為比較少來天母，這間店又是天母的早午餐名店，有機會來當然要多嚐嚐看囉！吃不完（後來確實吃不完，因為份量太大了）再打包吧！首先端上的是，經典美式漢堡！看看那漢堡麵包裡那塊看起來美味多汁誘人的大塊牛肉，生菜蕃茄以及非常酸而美妙的醃黃瓜放在旁邊，光用想的都受不了了！更別說旁邊的知名炸薯條，淋上起司並灑上一點培根.... 真的，就先別管什麼體重，健康問題了，先咬上一大口再說吧！</strong></p>

<p><strong>Next one is the Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon. I’ve always loved the outlook of this classical dish - really looks delicious and geometrically beautiful. But I don’t particular like so much egg and I am also not a fan of muffins. My wife ordered this and she enjoyed it very much. Since we have fries already, hash brown was selected as the potato option. “hash” brown … cool. :-)</strong></p>
<p><strong>第二道也是知名的班乃迪克蛋，兩顆半熟蛋（水波蛋），上面澆上荷蘭醬（奶油，蛋黃蛋白與檸檬等材料做成），置於Muffin上，這道是選擇煙燻鮭魚當主料。我特別喜歡這到料理的外型，看起來非常完美而可口。只是，實際上我並不特別喜歡吃這麼多蛋，也沒有特別愛吃Muffin，所以是我老婆點的。配菜選擇煎薯餅，煎薯餅英文是hash brown，讓我想起hash是加密貨幣理常見的一個技術詞彙。</strong></p>

<p><strong>Last, we have the Mexican Wraps shredded sausages. I really like this one although it doesn’t look particularly splendid. The sour cream, the ingredients, the salsa sauce… all tasted GREAT and SPICY! Just love the flavor… also comes with a small fruit salad. By the way, it would be a great loss to American if you shut the door to Mexico.</strong></p>
<p><strong>最後是墨西哥捲餅。看起來沒什麼，因為好東西都捲在裡面了。內容物是生菜，煎炒碎香腸與酸奶油等，配上辣辣的莎莎醬，實在是又辣又好吃啊！墨西哥是個充滿各式美妙文化的地方，可千萬別蓋高牆擋住啊！</strong></p>

<p><strong>It was really a satisfying brunch for us - giving us all the engery needed to stroll through this interesting neighborhood and explore the Shi Dong market that we had never been too. A final photo shows the front of JB’s Diner. </strong><del><strong>Oh, sorry about my car blocking the sight … I couldn’t find a parking space so I just parked in front of the store, giving no regards to any fines that might incur because I am just filthy rich….&nbsp;</strong></del></p>
<p><strong>Sorry, where was I? :-)</strong></p>
<p><strong>這一頓早午餐，份量既足又非常美味，我們吃得很開心，還打包帶走不少。一頓好早餐，讓人充滿能量，讓我們那一天走遍天母附近有趣的街道巷弄，也去了士東市場。最後一張照片是餐廳正面照，</strong><del><strong>抱歉，我的車擋到一點，因為當天我找不到停車位，就索性停在店門口，不管可能會被開罰單，反正老子超級有錢，錢多到花不完嘛！....&nbsp;</strong></del></p>
<p><strong>抱歉，一時失神，我說到哪兒了？：）</strong></p>

<p><strong>HOPE YOU ENJOY THE FOOD &amp; THE FUN!! 希望你"看"得很開心囉！:)</strong></p>
