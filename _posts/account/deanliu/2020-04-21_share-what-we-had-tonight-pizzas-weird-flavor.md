I passed by a small pizzeria this evening and I decided to take away some pizzas home for dinner since my son loves pizza and we have not eaten it for quite a while.

It's a family store run by a couple and I ordered three pizzas, three small ones, that I would like to share with you, for a reason. :)

The first one is ... Beef flavor!!

The second one is .... Seafood flavor! Yum~~~~

And, the third one, also the last one is .... I'll let you guess. I bet it's hard to guess since it's difficult to judge by its appearance... ^0^

Okay, say no more. I will tell you now...

It's **Stinky Tofu** flavor!!! Cool, isn't it!? 

I can smell it before I opened the box!! lol

If you're thinking ***eeeew or yuck~~~~~~***, sorry, it's actually quite good to eat! I'll say it's the best among the three!!!

Just eat and don't smell it. Haha! I will buy again next time...
