This isn't a magical formula of any kind.

The first number is in general the ratio of your author's reward to total post reward.

The second number is the dollar value of current SBD - *the dollar* in this system.

Therefore, say if you can manage to produce a $10 post, in the end you can only get $4.5 only.

Ouch! That's gonna hurt! Consider how hard it is to earn rewards from this vote-trading dominant platform, the real reward you are gonna get may let you down again... 

Yeah, this is one of the bad consequences of serious underpegging SBD. 

To learn that your real reward is actually 40% lower 
 than you expected may not be the most damaging, but making you doubt the honesty of this platform might be.

I have always been a supporter of the SBD, but after this time, now I have doubts too.
