### Dear Steemians and Dlivers,

<br>Yeah, that's right. After many good friends of mine on Steem have joined this hot platform and thanks to @travelgirl's sincere invitation, I have decided to give it a try and start yet another new journey on Steem with @Dlive from now on.

Actually at first I did not think that's a good idea. Not only because 95% of the time my blogs are static - mostly texts and sometimes my photos, but also due to the fact that ... I have never shown up in any of my photos or videos - body, face, voices... no, nada. I care about my private identity and I don't think this is any obstacle to a deep interaction with my audience. *How can a guy like this do LIVE streaming?* Right, that was my thought when they invited me.

However, mainly two things changed my mind afterwards. 

Firstly, they explained to me that Dlive not only has LIVE streaming, but also videos, meaning that ***you don't need to do LIVE videos to use that platform***!! That was the first time I know about it - before that I thought anything on Dlive must be at least live when you post it and then those live videos become non-live and can be viewed afterwards. Obviously I was wrong. So, I have done videos before so I should definitely consider using it.

Secondly, since the invitation I got intrigued by the idea of LIVE streaming and cannot drop this idea out of my mind. ***What makes people want to watch live streaming?*** *What's the true value for being **live**?* *What can I do on DLive to increase value for others while sticking to my principles of not revealing myself?* ... All sound very interesting and challenging to me. So I cannot resist the idea of doing something *really different* or even *experimental* on DLive. The question changed from *why* to *why not*... 

So there you go,

### Dean Liu is on DLive!!

<br>Sounds so meant to be, right? ^_^ Please don't expect to see me in person, because I still won't show up in *any* of my future streams or videos. Besides, I am no pretty girls so really you miss nothing and let my *brain* do the value-up to this live streaming arena, ok?

It certainly will be quite difficult to do live streaming without a host, but I don't want to join here and only do videos. So ***I promise that I will definitely do live streaming at least once*** and hopefully more if I have good ideas keep coming and for the rest I will also explore what kind of videos I can bring to you to enrich this platform.

I already have one idea about my experimental live streaming, but I will keep it as a surprise and I need time to get familiar with those technical details.  

Meanwhile, I will explore more about what others are doing on DLive - it's quite a new thing to me too! I have already checked out the platform and most of live videos seem to be gaming. Some where deep down my memory long ago, I can really appreciate the value of watching others playing games - yeah, I understand as when I was very young, I used to stand behind the arcade game consoles and watch others play and I could stand there for a long long time as if I was playing ... Kind of like that right? 

While I can still understand it, me as a middle aged person can no longer afford the luxury of spending my time like that. So one of my goal here is to explore the potential ways to utilize ***live streaming***, or, in simpler words, *how to play it differently!?* 

I'll end this with this question mark and keep you waiting for the answer. ^_^

Thanks for reading and thanks for future ***watching***. I'll see you soon!

CN區朋友們好，

是的，劉美女也來加入@DLive了！我即將開始使用這平台囉！

但是請別開心太早啊（其實根本沒人開心，嗚嗚嗚），我真人不露相的原則還是不會改變的喔。什麼？不露臉不出聲音，還要搞什麼Live啊？

對啊，我一開始也是這麼想。但是呢，DLive的夥伴 @travelgirl來邀請我時跟我說明了，你不一定都要做即時轉播，其實DLive平台也可以當成視頻平台的。這是我第一次知道這件事，原來我一直以為，你要玩DLive的話，上傳的那第一次必須是要直播的，之後變成非直播的視頻，可以重複觀看那就是一定的囉。原來如此，所以我還是可以考慮一下（畢竟... 咳咳.... ^^）。

其次是，自從開始理解直播這回事之後，我開始對這件事感到興趣：到底人們為什麼要看直播？直播的價值在哪裡？不只是Steem，外界直播的市場非常大的，尤其是亞洲。所以，我也開始思考這一回事.... 或許，我也可以挑戰一下，用全新的方式來玩直播這件事？似乎是很有趣的挑戰哪。

總之呢，後來我就覺得可以一試，只是拖了比較久才寫這一篇聲明，真不好意思啊！^_^

來來來，鄉親父老注意啦！

### Dean Liu is on DLive!! 劉美女開始玩直播啦！

<br>哈哈，這句話聽起來很吸引人吧！但我還是不會露臉說話的喔！往後我的視頻影音相關的文章，就會改以DLive來做為平台，而且我也承諾，既然上DLive，就不能迴避玩直播，我都說要以全新方式來玩了，至少我會做到一次，也希望我能玩出更多花樣，一起來探索思考，什麼樣的直播，能夠帶給人們什麼樣不同的感受吧！

目前DLive的影音，直播類可能主要是以Gaming為主。我年輕的時候可能也會非常瘋這個，所以我可以理解。但年紀大了（都25歲了），這類型的視頻已經無法讓我感到有趣了，所以我想，我的任務就是為比較高齡的用戶，來找出直播這個新時代的產物，能否對他們的生活也產生一點意義吧？哈哈，沒那麼嚴肅，反正就是盡量玩出不一樣的東西囉！

**那麼，就有勞讀者們轉型成觀眾們，持續鎖定，拭目以待囉！**
