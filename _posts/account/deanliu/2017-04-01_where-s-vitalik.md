<p>Well, people said that the payout is gonna be low recently, so let me share something <em><strong>not important at all and meaningless</strong></em>, but it may be fun if you like to find "<em><strong>Wally</strong></em>" in a big picture when you were a kid. :)</p>
<p>This is NOT an April fool post at all, I hope you believe me. Anyway, is or is not is not important. All because the payout is low... LOL...</p>
<p>Let's start finding <strong>Vitalik</strong> in the following photos that I took (see <a href="https://steemit.com/mcnugget/@deanliu/you-would-have-to-turn-a-chicken-mcnugget-into-a-chicken-to-be-able-to-hack-it-buterin-quoting-tapscott-on-twitter">my previous post</a> if you want to know why and <a href="https://steemit.com/mcnugget/@deanliu/my-steemit-mcnugget-trending-post-surpassed-buterin-s-tweet-in-google-search-beer-time">what happened to mcnuggets</a> ... ). Apologies for their low quality. <strong>You can support me upgrading to a better phone by upvotes</strong>... lol ... but I am not kidding... I am thinking about it recently...&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The following two photos will definitely reveal where he was ... Just too obvious..&nbsp;</h2>

<p>**** <strong>&nbsp;the lady</strong>:&nbsp;<em>"hmmm... I think I am gonna let my son play computers as long as he wants from now on ... "&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>**** Oh, yes, this is <em><strong>the stupid gesture</strong></em> you will be asked to do when doing public photo shooting in Taiwan ... &nbsp;</p>
