<p>Dear DailyDialogue Darlings, we have come to the <strong>100th</strong> (don't get me started) issue of this beta dialogue! Maybe it is time for a little narcissism, which is a hot topic last week. If you need a link to know this, then you are not one of us. Please transfer $1 SBD to me so I will tell you (20% discount if you send within 24 hours). Back to the topic - narcissism is actually good for self-esteem, even better for self-steems here. Everybody need a little dose of narcissism so we feel good every morning. Cheers!</p>
<p><strong>Previously on DailyDialogue</strong> &nbsp;<a href="https://steemit.com/dailydialogue/@deanliu/dailydialogue-beta-0001-keeping-track-of-my-crypto-new-life">#0001</a> , <a href="https://steemit.com/dailydialogue/@deanliu/dailydialogue-beta-0010-i-said-there-is-no-theme-alright">#0010&nbsp;, </a><a href="https://steemit.com/dailydialogue/@deanliu/dailydialogue-beta-0011-out-of-steam">#0011</a></p>
<p><strong>Picture of the Day</strong> - <em><strong>Echoing the theme today (I said no theme in a previous issue? well, sue me). Not a narcissus? It IS. Because I say so. &nbsp;</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Narcissism Demonstrated</strong></p>
<p>First, about <strong>OUR </strong>achievement. See how we have monopolized this tag?! An encouraging message here: everyone can do this as I am nobody and with a cheap smartphone and office lousy computer, YOU can do it too. ACT TODAY! or tomorrow if you are just too beat up. or never, whatever.</p>

<p>Secondly, I just cannot help but share with you my little hobby of photography ( @berniesanders please upvote one of them to encourage me! &lt;-- thought you are "narcissistic" today?). See how these mini photos looking great together after I deliberately edit the screenshot to present to you... They are my little babies... Love them. Click @deanliu to see them if you want.</p>
