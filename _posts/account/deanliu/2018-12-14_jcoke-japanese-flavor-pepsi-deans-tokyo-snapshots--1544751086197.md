We encountered this unique flavor of Pepsi coke when we visited Tokyo a few weeks ago.

Of course, I did not hesitate and bought one bottle from the vending machines.

Opened it with much curiosity, wondering what kind of taste can represent Japan, I took a big gulp ... and ...

### Yuck!  

What the Fxxk is that taste!? It's hard to describe... but it felt so .... *artificial* ... Anyway, not enjoyable at all ... personal opinion only of course.

I wonder if any Japanese Steemians can come forward and tell us more about this *unique* flavor of Pepsi and if local people enjoy it. I am really curious... 

But I still encourage all of you to buy one bottle and try it. Maybe you will like it... ^_^
