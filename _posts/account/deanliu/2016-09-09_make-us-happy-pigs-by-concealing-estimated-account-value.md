<h3><strong>Have you checked your Steemit Wallet lately, especially today!?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Even the most insensitive users have noticed the drastic falling of Steem prices... Complaints, criticisms, and solutions abound. That's alright and understandable...</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong>... whatever the dev team thinks of this recent trend, there is <strong>ONE THING</strong> that you can do easily and immediately, without breaking any rules or promises, to <strong>increase the spiritual well being of fellow Steemians</strong>.</p>
<h2>That is ---- Conceal the "Estimated Account Value" in our wallet balance!!&nbsp;</h2>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/2016-09-097.55.1079f58.png</p>
<p>We hate to see this decreasing number <strong>EVERYDAY</strong> to disturb our peaceful state of mind when Steeming !!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seriously, turning it off doesn't affect anything here, not even transparency. Those number crunchers can always calculate their and others' exact account values easily - they don't need you to provide this convenience. Nor do we who don't really or don't want to see the 'truth' every time when we need to take care of daily transactions like investing in RHW and etc...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why Not!? It is good for EVERYBODY!</strong></p>
<p>Let me demonstrate by showing graphs from SteemWhales.com (graph credit to the site). Normally we see this chart for someone's wealth.</p>

<p><strong>Why not remove the red dots and line (estimated value) and just focus on the INCREASING SPs!!&nbsp;Feel much better!? Feel confident and much better!?</strong></p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/2016-09-098.02.17a6847.png</p>
<p>That's really what long term investors and Steemit believers should do right?! <strong>Focus on SPs, not current value</strong>!! Oh, this is not a suggestion to SteemWhales.com - these graphs just happen to nicely demonstrate how people feel everyday. Suggestion only to Steemit.com to conceal that excruciating number...&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least... Give us an <strong>OPTION to TURN IT OFF</strong>!!&nbsp;</p>
<h2>DON'T YOU THINK NOW IS THE PERFECT TIMING, EVERYONE!? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
