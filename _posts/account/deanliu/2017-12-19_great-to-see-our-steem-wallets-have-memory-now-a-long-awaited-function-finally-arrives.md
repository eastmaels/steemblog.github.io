Great news for Steemians!

Oh, I did not mean the sky-rocketing Steem price although it might be a greater news than this one but I assume most of you have already known this...

What I am referring to is that ...

**Our Steem/SBD wallets finally have memory now!!**

Yes! They can remember which accounts you have made fund transfers to before. I must say this has been one of my most anticipated function on Steemit and now I finally got it before Christmas!! Woohoo~~~

Now you and I don't have to worry about mistyping account names and lose all your cherished Steems or SBDs! I suppose it doesn't really need much work but may benefit a lot of careless people ... But we have it now so I am happy and thankful for the Steemit team!

***Edit note: thanks to @aggroed for letting me know. We should mainly thank @netuoso for [making this development contribution thru utopian.io](https://steemit.com/steemdev/@netuoso/check-out-the-new-transfer-autocomplete). I can now feel the power of decentralized development! ^^ (please upvote his post to thank him!)***

I've seen so many times of this kind of tragedy happening to many Steemians. Not happening to me as I am really so careful not to make this mistake, but the psychological pressure is quite tormenting especially when I am responsible for sending people what they deserve to have from a public account that I am in charge! For instance, I have a collaboration with @wilkinshui and I send funds to him at least weekly, so I need to make sure I did not send to @willinshui, @wilkinhui, @wilkinshiu, etc ... Even if these accounts are not registered, my funds will still be gone forever!!

See? It is the same for the even more important exchanges! I can easily identify @bittrex from the list it provides now rather than checking my spelling again and again... (*credit to the Steemit team that they had the exchange memo reminder before this memory function come live*). Is it bittex, bitrex, bitterx, or bitterex? Oh, give me a break... 

See the following image. Now the list even include those accounts that you are following!! It totally makes sense! Very considerate! <3

I guess with rising Steem price, people may benefit from this new function even more!

***Merry Christmas in advance to all those who contribute to make Steem better! ^^***
