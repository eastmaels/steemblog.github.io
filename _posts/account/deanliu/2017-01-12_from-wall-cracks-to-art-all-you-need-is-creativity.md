<p>Recently there is a news in Taiwan about a young architect, Mr. Fu, using his drawing talent and imagination to convert possible defects on the walls of the buildings he builds into lovable artwork that even the clients ask him to create more on the walls. Originally it was difficult to explain to the clients that hairline wall cracks are inevitable and now imperfections bring beautiful creations! This story teaches us that we need to try to view things differently sometimes in order to get out of a situations that seems unsolvable. And, use your imagination.</p>
<p>Let's see how Mr. Fu does all the magic to bring these cracks to live!</p>

<p>高雄市最近有一位35歲的傅姓建築師因為他的隨手牆壁塗鴉而爆紅。當他把房子交給業主時，喜歡在牆壁畫上可愛逗趣的插畫，但原來那些都水泥乾掉出現的正常裂痕，由於早年跟業主解釋都不被接受，他乾脆畫畫「自首」，沒想到業主看到後不但不再抱怨施工品質，反而主動要求把插畫留下。不管是旅人牽著駱駝在沙漠中行走、還是男童攀爬在牆邊掙扎，或者是極限運動家靠著繩索垂直而上，在在顯示畫者的想像力無窮。所以，生活中多多運用想像力，從不同角度看事情，說不定會出現意想不到的好效果！</p>
