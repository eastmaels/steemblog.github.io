<p>Dear #photography steemians, here I am again. Previously I have shared three posts about Tokyo (<a href="https://steemit.com/cuisine/@deanliu/treat-of-tokyo-a-collection-of-cuisine-from-a-trip-in-2015-winter">Treat of Tokyo 1</a> and <a href="https://steemit.com/cuisine/@deanliu/treat-of-tokyo-2-a-collection-of-cuisine-see-what-the-city-can-offer-you">Treat of Tokyo 2.</a> And then a <a href="https://steemit.com/photography/@deanliu/geometry-of-tokyo-a-collection-of-shapes-and-light-and-shadows-from-my-trip">Geometry of Tokyo 1</a>.), and was so delighted to know that an amateur like me who just love to travel and take photos (with all my heart though!) can also have some positive feedbacks - maybe that's the SteemPower (which may become Steem Powers indeed lol)! </p>
<p>The sharing itself is good enough - after all, who would want to check out your photos if you did not show them in a decent art gallery? So I will keep doing this, digging, rummaging all my own photo files and select my favorites to share them here. Hope to see more feedback in replies, although upvotes are certainly appreciated.</p>
<p>Most of the photos were taken by my Sharp smartphone ('smart', but really cheap. model SH837 which cost around 200 us dollars only 3 years ago. I am still using it). So, <em>average joe with below-average phone</em>, but these photos I think are still not too bad, huh? Of course, the scene is the key. Tokyo rocks!</p>
<p>There aren't many users from Japan. Previously I thought posts in Japanese use &quot;#jp&quot; but lately found out that maybe I should use #ja instead. So I change the tag in this post. </p>
<p><em><strong>Beauty transcends cultural boundaries, languages, and even space and time</strong></em>. Hopefully so does Steemit. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Above is the famous <strong>Tokyo Station</strong>  (東京駅, <em>Tōkyō</em>-eki).</p>

<p>The above three photos were taken inside the <strong>Tokyo Station Hotel</strong>. Just love this hotel! Probably write another post someday to introduce it. </p>
