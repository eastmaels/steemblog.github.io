<h3>Everybody here knows what SBD is. So I hope this news can makes you smile on this special day - Smile Day, is it? 聽說今天是國際微笑日，希望這篇報導可以讓你微笑一下。關於SBD。</h3>
<p><strong>以下是台灣東森新聞轉報導大陸新聞</strong></p>
<p><strong>The following news report (in Chinese) comes from Taiwan's online news: ettoday.net (link in the title). I will translate in the following.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ettoday.net/news/20160813/754724.htm">燒錢啦！人妻把萬元鈔票藏電鍋　一煮飯就焦焦脆脆了</a></p>
<blockquote>浙江省紹興市的王姓夫妻半年前來到柯北工業園區打工，因為住在外地，家裡又經常有朋友造訪，王妻便把家裡的錢藏在電鍋下面。某天兩人在煮飯的時候，突然聞到一股燒焦味，原來鍋子下的鈔票沒有拿出來，已經燒焦了！</blockquote>
<blockquote>根據《紹興縣報》報導，王姓夫妻居住在附近村民家中的出租屋，房屋的面積不大，平常來家裏作客的人又多，擔心積蓄的錢被人摸走，於是妻子便把鈔票都才在電飯鍋下方。11日上午煮飯的時候，他們忘記把鈔票先取走，飯鍋忽然冒出黑煙和焦味，夫妻倆人才想起鍋子下面的錢。</blockquote>
<blockquote>情急之下，王妻馬上把插頭拔掉，並把鍋子拿起來，可是一整疊鈔票有的已經完全燒焦，有的則部分被燒壞。夫妻倆二事後馬上把鈔票的「殘渣」拿到銀行兌換，行員幫他們把24張受損百元人民幣鈔票（約1萬1千元新台幣）兌換出18張，並建議他們，「現在銀行的據點很多，有暫時不用的錢還是存進銀行比較保險。</blockquote>
<p><strong>The following is my own translation of the news (Aug 2016).</strong></p>
<blockquote>Mr and Mrs Wang in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, China (mainland) left their hometown half an year ago to work in an industrial park away from home. As they often have friends visiting to the place where they rented, Mrs Wang decided to hide their hard earned <strong>money</strong> inside their rice cooker/<strong>steamer</strong> (use water steam to cook rice- my note) when there were guests in the house. One day when they were preparing for a meal… suddenly they smelled something <strong>burning</strong> and realized that they forgot to take the money out before cooking. Mrs Wang immediately pulled the plug of the steamer but a wad of hundred Chinese yuan bills had been ‘cooked’ and some were completely burnt. They brought the charred remains to a bank and the staff was able to help exchange 18 out of 24 damaged bills and recommended the couple to put their spare money in banks in the future (are you sure banks are safe? - my note).&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p><strong>So, in this story, they lost 600 Chinese yuan (RMB), roughly $90 USD, or $95 SBD at the moment. And all the money actually became…</strong></p>
<p><strong>所以，根據報導，這對夫妻損失了600人民幣，大約是90塊美金，目前約95塊錢SBD。這些被電鍋（電飯寶）燒焦的錢，於是乎可以稱為...</strong></p>
