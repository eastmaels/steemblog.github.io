## Hunter's comment
Pebby is a pet product that aims to connect you and your pet when you are away from him/her. With modern technology, Pebby comes with a self-moving ball and features a camera inside that can be accessed through your smartphone. 

With Pebby, now your pets will never be alone at home! You can track, monitor, and play with your pet from anywhere in the world! 

If you let your pet wear a smart collar, the the Pebby ball can even play with him/her automatically when you need to go to a meeting or take care of something remotely... The smart ball contains a camera so you can keep an eye on your pet 24 hours and there is even a human safe laser, which is irresistible for every kitty worth his whiskers! Microphone is definitely a must so you two can "talk" to each other from time to time!

Hey, maybe you already have this idea .... this is actually not just a pet product... It is a **mobile monitor camera**!! Wow, so cool....
