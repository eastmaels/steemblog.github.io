In light of what happened yesterday, I have retracted all my delegations to some good projects and friends. I will reconsider after this drama comes to a stable outcome (if ever).

The bottom line for me is that exchanges should not interfere, NO MATTER WHAT. I consider Steem dead or at least half dead after yesterday. Why am I still here? Steem was mine, as much as yours or theirs. I will see it through. 

即日起撤回所有我(有限)對一些好項目與朋友的支持。Steem已死，我還是會期待它重生，就像是父母不會遺棄自己孩子而去，我會站到最後一刻。謝謝孫老闆為我上了一堂關於區塊鏈最真實的課，幾乎是我來Steem以來最重要的一課，區塊鏈大師無誤。事後若此地"Steem"繼續正常運轉，我會將CN區相關支持項目繼續恢復代理支持。
