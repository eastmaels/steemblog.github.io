I was pretty excited about feeling the power of crypto in Tokyo before I came here. After my arrival, I quickly shared my [first encounter with bitcoin in Tokyo](https://steemit.com/travel/@deanliu/deans-tokyo-snapshots--first-encounter-with-bitcoin-in-tokyo-8sm22bhy), which was ... well, pretty lame. XD... 

Now, a week has passed and I am cooling down now because: 1) I am traveling with family so most of those possible places that accept bitcoin payment seem not suitable for taking my son for a meal... >_< ... and 2) crypto prices plummeted so I am less incentivized to spend them now... 

So, instead of looking to spend them (but I will keep looking though), now I only look for signs of crypto here... 

Here are two ways of finding crypto traces in Tokyo: 1) bookstores and 2) find the locations of those crypto companies and ... well, take a shot and leave. lol

<h2>Bookstores</h2>

It seems crypto and blockchain related books are still hot in Tokyo... It's a pity that I cannot read Japanese.

<h2>Crypto Companies</h2>

**Roppongi Exchange** !? Never heard of it, but good to know they exist! ^^

**bitFlyer**!! Probably the biggest crypto exchange in Japan and they are located near my hotel, inside the Tokyo Midtown. These photos show how far I can get to them. LOL~~~~

I hope you are not too disappointed... Trust me. I am paying much attention to this issue during my trip.... Hope I can bring more to you! ^^

*this **Dean's Tokyo Snapshots** series ( #dean-tokyo as a specific tag) is my photographic diary for my family trip to Tokyo. Due to busy schedule and a naughty boy with us, I won't be able to write much but I will make sure that every photo that I choose means something, at least to me... I hope you enjoy this photo series as well as me! Feel free to comment but I probably won't have much time making replies often. Apologies first. :p*

***follow me @deanliu if you haven't! or not, if this does not interest you...^^***
