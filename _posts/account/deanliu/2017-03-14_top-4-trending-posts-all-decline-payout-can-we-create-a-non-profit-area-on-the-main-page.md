<p>As title. This should be the first time I see a trending page looks like this - Top 4 All decline payout. I know the experiment is probably one major reason for this. Anyhow, this got me thinking ...</p>
<h3>Maybe it is a good thing that if you want exposure, then sacrifice your potential rewards!?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In addition to having the <strong>Promotion</strong> function - where you need extra money to push it upwards, can we create a <strong>Non-profit</strong> post section where posts are ranked by <em>potential forfeited rewards</em> (curators should still have their cuts)? It would be better &nbsp;yet if authors can set a forfeited ratio.</p>
<p>Just thinking ...&nbsp;</p>

<p>this post is used to capture this interesting moment. The idea comes during this post. :)</p>
