Hi dear friends, [this](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUgEHGRGqudJUcxY42HWURdeLXcycc2e4aQKrd5c3tXcd/Screenshot_20171225-074355.png) was how my chat app [LINE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(software)) greeted me when I woke up yesterday, the Christmas day, in the morning [in the hotel room of Taipei Regent](https://steemit.com/christmas-countdown/@deanliu/christmas-countdown-in-taipei-6-finale). No more [counting down](https://steemit.com/trending/christmas-countdown) now! 

I was really glad to see this greeting in that lovely day to start my Christmas ... and it ain't over yet! When I opened the door to get the newspaper, there was a little surprise too! ^_^

I will switch to another view to let you visualize this. See what's there on the door knob? Oh, no, is it what I think it is?

Hohoho~~~ Santa was here last night to give me presents! I must be very behaved this year to be able to receive this gift! :)

See how cute this Christmas sock is? What a great surprise from <del>the hotel</del> Santa! (the black bag is just the newspapers)

Let's see what's inside! Wow, chocolate and a little card! My son was thrilled to see this little gift ...

After we had such a pleasant start of this holiday, we went downstairs to have breakfast and somehow I felt that this dish that I put together looked very Christmas too! :)

And after another relaxing morning in the room, it was checkout time and we had to end this little getaway trip... But not yet, we went to the hotel cafe after checking out and stayed there for a while. It's interesting to see the cookie come with a eatable QR code (can anyone decipher that one? I did not try. I ate it only).

The cafe looks so elegant. I love its design. I sat there for an hour and more while my family went for shopping.

The music and the decorations keep reminding you of Christmas. That was when I started to realize that I finally had enough of it.
