Dear TT,

I don't know when you will finally find this article but no matter when it will always be the same

I want to tell you that you don't owe me anything. At all. Nothing at all.

No matter how much I love you. No matter how much I'd sacrificed for you. No matter how much pain you have brought me...

You don't owe me anything. At all.

You don't owe me money. You don't owe me caring. You don't owe me love, although I would certainly welcome any.

I will always love you. But you, always, don't owe me anything.

Oh, one thing only, sorry that I forget this. One and the only thing you owe me and always owe me.

That is, your existence, your being.

You owe me that. That's the only thing I ask of you to offer as long as your mother and I exist.

We will always love you.

Love,

Dad
