As I have been watching NBA playoffs lately, I ask myself the same question that I had last year: 

### Why don't we have a NBA betting service on Steem?

Well, if in last year, that was just a question to express my desire or complaint ... It certainly ***is*** a legitimate question this year ... 

Because right now we have lots of betting apps on Steem, you name it, dice games, poker games, or slot machines ... and more...

There is no reason that we cannot have sports betting on Steem too!! It IS a huge market as well! It's not only just ***profitable***, but could also contribute a lot to onboarding new users who love sports! 

I will definitely bet on some games so I can enjoy more when I watch them. For instance, I might consider betting on LA Clippers if the rate is good enough despite me being a Warrior fan ... Clippers really did a hell of job in game 2 to finally win the game from behind....  From now on to June, I would love to bet on NBA playoffs if there is a way to bet with STEEM. 

Think about it, developers or entrepreneurs, whoever can give me a sports betting app for NBA 2020.

It's not that hard, IMHO. You can just ask for collaboration with some traditional online sports betting websites and bridge their service onto Steem. Betting is basically the same, only we use STEEM to bet. Of course, you can further develop it to be a DApp so every wager can be traced on the blockchain. 

I don't have the energy or time to do this, so I write this post and hope someone will be interested to develop it and I will be a happy user!
