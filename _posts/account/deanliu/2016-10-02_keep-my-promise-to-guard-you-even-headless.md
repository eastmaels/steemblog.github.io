<p><strong>Promised to keep you safe from all evils a hundred years ago</strong></p>
<p><strong>Decades gone by, me and the lion are still here despite my decapitation</strong></p>
<p><strong>See my strong gesture and hear the lion's roar</strong></p>
<p><strong>We'll always be up here for you.</strong></p>
<p>[my own photo, my own.... words... ]</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>. <em>This is a common seen guardian goddess in Quemoy (Kinmen) Island of Taiwan. They call it Wind Lion God (風獅爺). This one was set on roof and the knight on the lion has lost his head. Still looks formidable. 這是金門常見的風獅爺，風獅爺在金門到處都是，這一個位在屋頂，騎獅者已經斷頭，但威武鎮攝之氣勢卻依舊長存！</em></p>
