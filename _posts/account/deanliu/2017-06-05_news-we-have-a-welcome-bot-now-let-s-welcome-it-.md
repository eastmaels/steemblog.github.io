<p>Accidentally, I just found out that now we, the steemit platform, now have a welcome bot for greeting new users!!</p>
<p>https://steemitimages.com/DQmSYoabnYbUVttHyW48oRonc2Uou7axnknmmdVmfWRQZd8/image.png</p>
<p>Seems this bot has just started today and in less than 24 hours (actually in just 18 hours), it has made 137 welcoming messages!! All its 'posts' are comments to new users. <del>I have no idea if this is official or not as there is no information at all that I can find</del>. Just found out that this bot is created by <a href="https://steemit.com/@reggaemuffin">@reggaemuffin</a> who says "I want this to be a warm place :)" on the profile page. Great jobs!!&nbsp;Check the following links by @reggaemuffin:</p>

<p>This reminds me of @wang, our early welcome bot and its creator. Unfortunately, @wang hasn't been active for quite a long time and it seems he is powering down for quite a while... He used to be a big supporter for me to so I have <a href="https://steemit.com/fun/@deanliu/a-dear-wang-letter-how-i-miss-you-and-steemit">some attachment</a> to him... See his profile and his only once farewell post</p>

<p>@wang has greeted more than 3,000 new users here including me!! Let's hope that @welcomebot can continue to do this job well while Steemit enters a high speed growth period!! :)</p>
