We have lost even this twilight.
No one saw us this evening hand in hand,
While the blue night dropped on the world.
 <hr>https://i.imgur.com/AgXK2QJ.jpg<hr>https://i.imgur.com/w6lP3tf.jpg<hr>I have seen from my window
The fiesta of sunset in the distant mountain tops.<hr>https://i.imgur.com/B1PEtAR.jpg<hr>Sometimes a piece of sun
Burned like a coin between my hands.<hr>https://i.imgur.com/I9qJB3y.jpg<hr>https://i.imgur.com/l5w8es1.jpg<hr>I  remembered you with my soul clenched
In that sadness of mine that you know.<hr>https://i.imgur.com/LTmMXg6.jpg<hr>Where were you then?
Who else was there?
Saying what?
Why will the whole love come on me suddenly
When I am sad and feel you are far away?<hr>https://i.imgur.com/69AIeHF.jpg<hr>https://i.imgur.com/GlsUuur.jpg<hr>The book fell that is always turned to at twilight
And my cape rolled like a hurt dog at my feet.<hr>https://i.imgur.com/usztKmq.jpg<hr>Always, always you recede through the evenings
Towards where the twilight goes erasing statues.<hr>Texts: poem of Pablo Neruda. Photos: mine.
