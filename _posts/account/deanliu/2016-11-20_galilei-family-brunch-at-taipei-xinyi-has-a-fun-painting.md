<p>I had some hesitation in sharing this family restaurant with you since although it is good but not really too special. However, when I reviewed those photos I took and saw the one I put above, I couldn't help sharing it - it is way TOO cute and hilarious!! Hence the title. So, read on.</p>
<p>原本我有點猶豫是否要分享這間親子餐廳「<strong>伽立略家庭餐廳</strong>」，因為好歸好，但沒太大特色。不過，整理照片看到一張餐廳的畫，太過犯規的可愛，實在讓我不得不分享，所以，就連餐廳一起分享吧。：）</p>
<h2>The Restaurant and the Painting</h2>
<p>This nice family restaurant, <strong>Galilei Family Brunch</strong>, is located on the 4F of Shinkong Mitsukoshi A8 Mall (Xinyi Place), at the heart of Taipei's newest core commercial area. It is really important for parents with little children if they decide to come here for shopping or having meals as this neighborhood is very crowded and good options for parents are really limited. Here they endeavor to provide a relaxing environment for parents as well as their little ones. You can see at the entrance that it is designed to be under a huge tree.</p>
<p>這間「<strong>伽立略家庭餐廳</strong>」位於台北信義計畫區新光三越百貨A8館4樓，這區是台北市最新最熱鬧的商業核心區域，遊客與當地客都多，雖然基礎設施很不錯，但用餐時間，許多餐廳很容易客滿，帶著小小孩的父母要找好的餐廳好好吃頓飯是不容易的。因此，這間親子餐廳的出現，對於許多父母是一大福音。這間餐廳價位比較高，所以他們對於父母餐點品質一樣很重視。入口可以看到一棵大樹造型。</p>

<p>They hang a really funny painting here and literally I find everyone who first sees this painting will at least smile, or often laugh. I saw this painting long time ago when I passed by and immediately I remembered this restaurant. Finally we went two weeks ago when we happened to need both: "family" (i.e. get rid of my kid) and "restaurant" (I need to eat! with dignity!). I really love this "Monalisa baby" but I don't know if it is original or just a copy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>一進入餐廳就會看到這幅「<strong>萌</strong>那麗莎的微笑」，我觀察了一下，沒有人看到會不笑的，實在太可愛了。早在我來消費之前好久，我就已經記得這餐廳，就是因為這幅畫。終於兩週前帶孩子來這裡買東西，中午到了，就來這裡試試看。我非常愛這幅畫，但不知道是複製品還是原作。</p>

<p>You can see lots of baby transportation vehicles parked here with some seasonal Halloween decorations.</p>
<p>嬰兒們的坐騎與當時的萬聖節裝飾。 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is an extremely important area - that's why we paid the premium price!! Let the devils go to their dens and let us eat like humans again!!</p>
<p>這一區至關重要，沒這個我們就不來了！讓各路惡魔們在此相聚吧，惡魔的僕人要休息吃飯，短暫重拾做人的尊嚴。</p>

<h2>The Food</h2>
<p>Their food is pretty good, considering that most family restaurant in Taipei don't pay much attention to adults' menu as they know our weakest point - we will come as long as they can provide good environment and food for kids. So quality food for parents is really just a bonus as well as how it stands out from its competitors. I did not take many photos of our food - too hungry to shot, you know. Here is one and it does look good.</p>
<p>他們的餐點其實很不錯，如果你知道的話，台北近年來開了很多親子餐廳，但是通常父母在乎的是設施以及小孩的餐點（這樣就會乖乖買單了），自己吃得就隨便一點，因為只要能夠短暫擺脫小惡魔，這比什麼都更美味！所以，如果餐廳對於父母餐點有用心的話，那麼就會讓人印象深刻，完美！所以，我們太餓了，我沒多拍大人餐點，只有這個剛上來的附餐拍下來了，看起來不錯吧。</p>

<p>My son had this kid's pasta. Although he kept asking his mother to feed him with her risotto. I probably ate more pasta than him - it was really good! You can see the spoon, fork and knife embedded in the tray with a house shape plate. Cute.</p>
<p>這個是我兒子吃的義大利空心粉，非常好吃，我可能吃得比他還多，他一直要吃媽媽的燉飯。兒童餐具很可愛，森林小屋造型。</p>

<h2>The Surroundings&nbsp;</h2>
<p>It is nicely located on a floor with a large balcony area where there are kids' playing equipment provided by the mall for free as well as some additional kids' small cars or train ride that requires some fee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>餐廳位於百貨公司一個有露台廣場的樓層，有開放空間，免費的兒童遊樂設施，有些要付費的小車子等。吃完到這裡跑跑曬曬太陽都是不錯的。</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the Monana's Smile!! :-) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>希望那張畫像讓你微笑一下，下次帶孩子到台北也可以到這間餐廳來吃頓可以放鬆的飯。</p>
