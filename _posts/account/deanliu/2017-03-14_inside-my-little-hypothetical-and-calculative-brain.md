<p>okay, I know that you need to vote before others vote, especially whales, due to some <em>number 2 rule</em> to get good curation rewards. and from somewhere I remember that someone (<em>maybe it was me?</em>) proposed to give <em>some </em>rewards for downvotes as well. I suppose that if it is executed then the same competing rule should apply.</p>
<p>now a group of whales are downvoting other non-cooperative whales' upvotes for neutralization in a whales-letting-go-power experiment. if so, that means you<em> either have to upvote before big upvotes come in or to downvote before big countering downvotes come in</em>. since you cannot have both upvote rewards and downvote rewards simultaneously (that would be illogical) so you need to make up your mind quickly - <em><strong>to upvote or to downvote? that is the question.</strong></em></p>

<p>hey! wait, but the rewards brought by big upvotes will be counteracted, making the reward smaller ... maybe I should downvote to get more?... arrrrr ... <em>warning: overflow error</em> ... forget it,...</p>
<p><strong>I will just vote for what I like and forget about whales! I have more influence now anyway </strong>(see <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@meesterboom/the-excitement-of-the-whale-experiment-why-we-should-get-on-board">here</a>)<strong>!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>Just for fun only, guys! we need to have more of that now. :)</em></p>
