## Hunter's comment
Mini Line Cube is an EDC gadget that is made out of aluminum alloy (some for making aircrafts, yes!) so it's light weight and strong. It is designed to transformed into so many kind of shapes and your creativity might be the limitation! You don't need  instruction manual or rule book to play it and it can take away your stress by making you indulging in having fun with it! With proper design, Mini Line Cubes can be turned into fashionable and wearable accessories! I will show you one exciting example later!

If you are still confused about how it can be played, let me show you two videos to get to learn more about it!

**- General introduction -**

**- Demonstration -**

Here is some comparison between MINI LINE CUBE and other puzzle games:

**Things in common**:
1. Improve your mental reflexes to problems.  
2. Better your eye-hand coordination. 
3. Improve concentration. 
4. Put your spatial intelligence to work. 
5. Improve thinking and memory 
6. Boredom and anxiety mitigation.

**Where Mini Line Cube is better**:
1. Impossible to have missing piece(s). 
2. Not limited to one solution but 40+ more. 
3. Incredibly light and portable. 
4. Piece of art by itself.

Last, the most exciting part is ..... (*drumroll please*....)

### They have FIFA World Cup 2018 Edition!!
