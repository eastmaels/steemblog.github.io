<p>Lately we have seen the SBD price goes up to <strong>more than 1 USD</strong>. And community senior members like @clayop, @abit&nbsp;and probably others have highlighted this issue. I sold my 60 SBDs a while ago and bought some Ether (not a bad investment so far). The margin between SBD and USD seems to be increasing lately. According to changelly.com, 1 SBD equals <strong>1.416</strong> USDT. I am not sure if USDT can still be trusted or be substitute for USD but you get the idea.</p>

<p>Recently I have saved some SBDs and now I am thinking again... (it's fun, isn't it?). But at the moment, all altcoins seem to be doing VERY WELL!! So it means they are also quite expensive now... What should I do? [cashing out fiat isn't an option for me as I love crypto!]. So I think... Maybe I can join some ICO atm, since they are not yet on the market, seems to mean that they are relatively cheaper. So I checked out <a href="https://www.smithandcrown.com/icos/">Smith&amp;Crown's ICO list</a>...</p>

<p>I decide to buy some more PeerPlays as their ICO isn't finished yet (I bought some before due to <a href="https://steemit.com/peerplays/@roelandp/peerplays-crowdfund-explained-by-pears">this</a>. lol). So I kind of know them so how. It is no big money so I go with it (this time I pay with SBD, the whole <strong>24</strong> of it!! and the site shows that it is worth $36 ... sweet!! ).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Viola! So now I have 6.4 more PeerPlays tokens with me!! Yes!&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Oh, you are welcome to&nbsp;copy my Redemption key .. A message is encrypted inside! LOL...</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Conclusion &amp; Warning</h3>
<p>1. The crypto world is so much fun - all on your finger tips. You can switch your asset instantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I decide to utilize this overpriced opportunity and meanwhile diversify my stakes a little bit. But Steem is always the top choice of my crypto-assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. WARNING: this is just a fun experience sharing. Doesn't mean that I am right.&nbsp;</p>
