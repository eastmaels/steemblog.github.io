I visited a friend last weekend. When I saw the above banner on the wall of his living room, I was surprised to see this logo that I assumed to be a sports team's resemble that of the bitcoin. I was at that time just taking about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies with my friend. I asked where he got that banner and he said he bought it so long ago when he visited the U.S. and couldn't remember. But soon we figure out that it belongs to [Boston Bruins](https://www.nhl.com/bruins) of the NHL - a hockey team. 

Let's compare them. See how they look alike? ^_^ A capital letter B with some bars behind inside a circle coin like shape and the colors are similar too!!

### I barely know anything about hockey (yeah, living in a sub-tropical country and all) and yet now I feel like a fan of the Boston Bruins already!! HA!!
