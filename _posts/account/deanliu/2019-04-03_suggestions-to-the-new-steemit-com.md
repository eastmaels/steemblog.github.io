In light of the new changes on Steemit.com as announced by @steemitblog, I would like to make some suggestions for possible future improvement since this very first UI of Steem is still very important for my daily Steem activities.

[Important Changes to Steemit.com and Wallet](https://steemit.com/steem/@steemitblog/social-condenser-is-live)

First of all, hats off to the team for making such efforts to separate Social function and the Wallet for efficiency and security's sakes. Thanks guys.

However, I cannot say that I am satisfied with other simultaneous changes as well. The following are three main drawbacks that I think worth looking into (IMHO):

1 . Layout for Ads

I know about the plans of putting ads to steemit.com but last time we were told that only when you were *not* logged in would you see those Google ads. and now they are here on Trending/New/Hot/Promoted pages (it's kind of weird to see ads on Promoted page though, but again this is a redundant page for a long time IMO). While this is of course the freedom of Steemit INC to put anything to their website for the sake of sustainability (after all, it does not take cut of the rewards for publishing on this UI), I would like to suggest to reconsider the layout of the ads ... they are too big at least and the position could be reconsidered for better browsing experience

2 . Languages setting for steemitwallet.com

We can set our preferred language on Steemit.com, but the new steemitwallet.com does not have such option. I am forced to see Chinese as the interface language (due to some local setting or sth?) which I am not used to and I prefer English. Besides, you only have simplified Chinese and that's not even my version of Chinese. Again, not critical at all, but user satisfaction.

3 . steemitwallet.com needs to crosslink back to steemit.com

While I click the account names on my wallet history, they are linked to those accounts on **steemitwallet.com**, not steemit.com. But actually I prefer steemit.com to see its profile page. It used to be so: you click @user on wallet history and it brought you to the user's profile, not his/her wallet. I believe linking back to Steemit.com is more suitable for the default setting for most Steemians. Also, we might need somewhere on steemitwallet.com that we can easily click back to steemit.com.

That's all. Maybe I should tag @andrarchy. ^_^

Have a lovely day, every one!
