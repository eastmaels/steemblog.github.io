<p>Came across an article by <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/author/perry-tekla-s" rel="noopener">Tekla S. Perry</a> on IEEE-Spectrum - &quot;<a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/consumer-electronics/audiovideo/goodbye-vcr-you-served-us-well" rel="noopener">Goodbye, VCR, You Served Us Well</a>&quot;. It pays tribute to VCR's 60 years service to mankind (1956-2016). Considering that DVD was invented in 1995, I guess it won't survive longer than even half that of VCR. </p>

<p>So, as #blockchain comes along, who will be said goodbye to? Maybe we can go further and ask when will blockchain be said goodbye to? </p>
