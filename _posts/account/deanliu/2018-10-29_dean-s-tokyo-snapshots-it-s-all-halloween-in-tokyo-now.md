### Halloween is soooooooooo big in Tokyo. You go anywhere and you can easily find some Halloween decoration. It's really crazy here and I don't know why... It seems Japan *invented* Halloween!! 

### Take a look of my collection over the past few weeks!

*this **Dean's Tokyo Snapshots** series ( #dean-tokyo as a specific tag) is my photographic diary for my family trip to Tokyo. Due to busy schedule and a naughty boy with us, I won't be able to write much but I will make sure that every photo that I choose means something, at least to me... I hope you enjoy this photo series as well as me! Feel free to comment but I probably won't have much time making replies often. Apologies first. :p*

***follow me @deanliu if you haven't! or not, if this does not interest you...^^***
