<p>Have some spare time this afternoon and I had some fun watching the live Steem price fluctuating up and down on Poloniex. I am not a (good) trader by any rate, so it was just like watching the stock market, only it is 10 times more volatile!! &nbsp;</p>
<p>The price was going down quickly all the way to around<strong> 0.00015</strong> and it did not stay long... Then, the price trend reversed and was pumping fast... when I saw a sell order of <strong>99,147</strong> Steems with price at 0.00016 hanging there, I was like "<em>well, see how long can the buyers break that huge wall...</em>" But...</p>
<p>All of a sudden, <strong>Boom!! In split seconds, it was gone!! </strong>WOW, this is the <em>largest single transaction</em> I have ever witnessed (but I am sure it is not uncommon as I seldom follow the market for even 5 mins). 99k is like 9 times my total SP... I guess this is how cruel the capital market is... Large amount of money flowing around... <em>No mercy, no feelings, only strategy, calculation and numbers...&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I guess I can never be a trader, just don't have that kind of heart. :)</p>

<p>Not really informative. But it is a fun experience to me. :)</p>
<p>By the way, if anyone has seen any posts analyzing the recent price surge, please share with me. Much appreciated.</p>
