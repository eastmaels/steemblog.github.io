<p>Steemians now post everyday by clicking &quot;<strong>Submit a Story</strong>&quot; to tell the world what message he or she wants to convey to the Steemian universe. The 'story' is generally referred to as 'post' here, and experienced Steemians know that you probably don't want to post more than 4 times within 24 hours so you won't be penalized by frequent posting. </p>
<p>Four posts, or even fewer, suffice if the author/creator seriously put his or her time into writing and/or crafting the posts everyday. Despite that we do see quite a variety of posts everyday, we have the 'tag' system to help us categorize different kind of posts, by content mostly (like steemit, life, travel...) and sometimes by others (like cn or kr for languages used). </p>
<p>But still, a post is just a post, not a message (so far only works while you send someone steem), not a ... well nothing else since there is no other vehicles to express anything (a reply is considered a post under a post). </p>
<p>Think about it. <strong>A 'tag' is something you use to tell others what the content of this post is concerned. It is NOT used to reflect your, the author's, intention in composing this post</strong>. For example, we can have different kinds of 'posts' in the future to reflect the author's purpose in using it. A possible taxonomy is:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Post</strong> - keep this original type to refer to most quality posts we have at the moment. it could be personal thoughts, ideas, experiences, stories, reports, photo demonstration, even academic papers that carry information with public value. This type is treated as how the system works right now.</li>
  <li><strong>Draft </strong>- easily understood. a preparation towards Post. privacy should be allowed. no reward of course.</li>
  <li><strong>Diary</strong> - a type that a Steemian can keep everyday or whenever he likes to himself (or go public if so chosen) that carries from murmuring, complaint, fantasy to self reflection. No need to be rewarded. Replies can be considered.</li>
  <li><strong>Club Post</strong> - if we are going to enhance the community property @ Steemit then people will join different clubs and posts within the club can facilitate discussion but need not be rewarded steemwise. </li>
  <li><strong>Others</strong> - free your imagination... </li>
</ul>
<p>The reason I bring up this issue is because I saw so many new users, with no ill intentions, post like they are asking for directions on the road. Also, I feel a desperate need to write up but not to publish it, and I don't want to do it in a separate website/app/paper. <em><strong>I hope I can go everywhere and use any device to continue Steeming without worrying if I have put my beloved work elsewhere..</strong></em>.</p>
