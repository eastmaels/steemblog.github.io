Just recently within 1 week, I have seen two replies under my own posts that are left by scammers via the stolen accounts saying something like "your post is plagiarized without your permission **here**" and the link attached will bring you to a phishing site asking for your passwords... 

An old trick as it may sound, I still clicked the link but I got vigilant after 1 second of my clicking and turned off the page immediately. No harm was done so far. It's really easy to lost alert after a long period of **peaceful** time. Especially when you are tired or not fully focused.

Then I saw a similar comment a few days later and I felt so bad for those victim accounts - most of the time liquid money in their account would be moved immediately to exchanges and the account would also be used to *trick* other users thus forcing policing accounts like @steemcleaners to downvote the comment with heavy weight which results in huge drop in Reputation scores...  

And last night, my friend, a senior user @aaronli was also hacked (but the reason for this hack is yet to be confirmed). So I think it's time to remind people so everyone can stay alert!

<h3>DO NOT Click ANY Links in the Comments, Not Even Those Made by Your Friends!! Unless You Have Checked Where It Links To....</h3>

各位朋友，近日騙子猖獗，我一週內已經看過兩次在我文章下留言說我文章被人抄襲，然後留下一個釣魚網站連結！我自己好久沒看到這類留言了，所以，第一次，當時很晚了，我看到只想說，蛤？誰抄襲我啊？所以就失去戒心，點下連結想看，結果一秒內恢復神智，馬上切斷連結，所以根本都還沒看到頁面。目前是沒事...

結果過兩天又一個類似的留言，我心想那表示最近一定很多受害者！點過去受害帳戶看，都能看到一大串被害者，這些帳戶看起來好無辜，前一天都還正常發文章，一切都很美好！突然間一切就變了，錢就被轉走，然後這帳戶開始變成殭屍，到處去留言，變成壞人的美麗面具....

CN有幾次高Rep帳戶被盜，但最近可能漸漸大家又淡忘了，所以，趕緊提醒一下大家！變這樣真的太慘啦！>_<

不幸的是，昨晚我們高人氣Aa先生，竟然也被盜了！但他被盜帳戶似乎不是上面說的這種釣魚方式，具體情況，只希望他帳戶趕緊恢復正常，來跟我們說說怎麼回事！目前 @aaronli帳號暫時沒有用去騙人的動作，但大家請先保持戒心喔！All the best to Aa！

總之，一句話：

<h3>請不要點留言內的任何連結！！任何！！包括你朋友的留言！除非，你已經做好確認連結的動作。小心為上！</h3>
