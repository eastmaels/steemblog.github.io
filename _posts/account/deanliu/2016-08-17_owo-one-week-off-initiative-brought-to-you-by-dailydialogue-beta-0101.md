<p>Friends complaining about not being able to reach you on Facebook? Walking on the street like a zombie lately? Cannot concentrate on your real work? A family storm is brewing?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me too. My 3 years old son had been sick last week. Me and my wife were exhausted from taking care of him. Documents on my office desk are piling up and many coming due dates are about to devour me. Friends not hearing from me for quite a few weeks on Facecook, oh sorry, Facebook. But I did find sometime to post quite frequently on Steemit in the past few weeks, sacrificing sleep since being too excited and cannot sleep anyway.</p>
<p>Today I feel that <strong>THIS HAS TO STOP</strong> for a while. Thus I am gonna put forward an initiative for those who experience the same with me to<strong> TAKE A BREAK OFF </strong>Steemit for one week.</p>

<h2>The O.W.O. #oneweekoff initiative</h2>
<p>Steemit lovers, it is time to take control of your life outside Steemit so you can be a better Steemian when you get back. During this ONE WEEK time, you agree to abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>No posts, replies, comments whatever you call them. Just don't type a word on it.</code></li>
  <li><code>No upvotes, no downvotes/flags, i.e., no curating at all.</code></li>
  <li><code>Stop using SteemStats.com.</code></li>
  <li><code>Keep reading Steemit articles to a minimum.</code></li>
  <li><code>Manage your wallet only if truly necessary.</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Leave home for traveling so you can really appreciate who you are. Leave Steemit for a while so we can have time to restore our real life and have time to watch Steemit in a distance that we can discover what Steemit truly means to us. A break from Steemit is definitely healthy for heavy users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am going to do it later today and try to be <strong>a good father, a good husband, a good friend, a good colleague, a good citizen and an obedient slave</strong>. Will come back after one week to tell you how I feel. Anyone in a similar condition is welcome to follow, use this tag and come back to share your experience! So, for now, Ciao Ciao!</p>
<p><strong>SELF MUTING IN 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...</strong></p>
<p>----------------------------- the above initiative is sponsored by Daily Dialogue ---------------------------</p>
<p>Friends, followers, admirers, yes, as you can see from the above, very sad to say goodbye to you for a while. I truly need to take control of my real life now - it is a mess. I have been Steeming too much like a non-stopping roller-coaster ride for 4 weeks. It is time to take a brief break and come back a better dialoguer. Please don't ditch me while I am gone, not a narcissist today. I will come back with better contents and funny features. For the last issue before this break, let's get started.</p>

<p><strong>Picture of the Day</strong> - <em><strong>Highest building in the world a few years back - Taipei 101 (right). Reasons being: me from Taipei; 101 is our issue number; 101 looks like OWO structure-wise; And, finally, it will always be there.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Too emotional to say anything else</strong></p>
<p>Check my photography post later today - it says all. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Final Note</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Welcome any suggestions and replies regarding this new experimental series! Just a reminder that it won't be indeed daily (!). Welcome to tag alone and grow together! See you all in no time!</em></p>
<p><em>Won't get back to you in one week.</em></p>
