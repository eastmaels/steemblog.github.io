<p>A few days ago I shared with you about this matter:</p>
<p><a href="How I deal with over-priced SBDs ... Warning... this may not be a good example!">How I deal with over-priced SBDs ... Warning... this may not be a good example!</a></p>
<p>https://steemitimages.com/DQmXupG7PsPU8HS5KmgywQvw9oYKFm1R3p1JNPWXGPWUKDR/image.png</p>
<p>Now since I have got some SBDs in the pocket and as I check changelly the SBD:USDT rate is close to <strong>1:1.4</strong> again (has been lower inbetween) so I am all experimental again (following @ace108 's suggestion I use the #myexperiment tag). Should I buy PeerPlays token again? Maybe... But it won't be fun as I have done that. And as I browse through many ongoing ICOs, either I cannot understand or it seems too expensive for me...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I think, oh yeah, maybe I can buy some more ICO tokens that I participated before and is now on the market. That's when I decide that I should look into <a href="http://matchpool.co/">MatchPool</a>'s current condition (yeah, I bought some during their ICO).&nbsp;If you ask why I invested in this token, I will answer you with the same answer for almost all ICOs that I have participated ...</p>
<h3>I love the concept!! For Matchpool, this idea has been in my brain way before I heard them.&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Besides, one additional Steem factor is that our respected leader here @ned is on their advisor&nbsp;list! (<strong>Ned, I am counting on you!!</strong>) &nbsp;XD</p>

<p>So, it seems a pretty good choice for my 19+ SBDs... Oh, one more thing actually... matchpool has actually&nbsp;suffered some glitches right after their successful ICO. A news report has it here: &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/the-matchpool-ico-scandal-is-all-smoke-and-no-fire/">Matchpool: The ICO 'Scandal' That Wasn't</a></p>
<p>So that's maybe why <a href="https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-GUP">its price on Bittrex</a> is currently not good. But as I have read the above article, I think it may be a good time to buy some more (actually a little bit more only... lol). Buy at a lower price is always a good choice if you still have confidence in it. Hence that's what I have done this morning!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Send 19+ SBDs to Bittrex --&gt; Sell it to get BTC --&gt; Buy GUP (Matchpool token) with it --&gt; Transfer it to my ethereum wallet</p>
<h3>Viola! So now I have 206 more GUP tokens with me!! Yes!&nbsp;</h3>
<p>[along with my existing ones]</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Finally, same conclusion and warnings apply as per <a href="https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@deanliu/how-i-deal-with-over-priced-sbds-warning-this-may-not-be-a-good-advice">my previous post</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Note. One ICO currently on that I love but did not mention is https://vivaco.in/ VIVA!! As I am already a happy investor. So I did not consider buying more <a href="https://vivaco.in/">VIVA Crown</a> with this small amount of SBDs. :)</p>
