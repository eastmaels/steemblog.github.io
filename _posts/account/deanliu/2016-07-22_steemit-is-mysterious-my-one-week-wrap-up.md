<p>I have been here for one week. It's kinda long in cybertime, but not so in my real life where I spend most of time working... Anyway, share some thoughts with you guys, maybe there are a lot (and obviously keep increasing) of new steemians out there who are like me - excited, thrilled, committed to write with very limited time, but at the same time confused, bewildered and sometimes a little bit frustrated...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't worry. This post, this wrap-up, is going to tell you......&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's exactly what steemit is: <strong>mysterious</strong>. <em>like life itself, like the crowd, like existence</em>. Really?! so profound? ha! I don't know. I am just a new comer. But just thought it would be good to share some thoughts so people like me can know that - You Are Not Alone!</p>
<p>Okay, I will just share two thoughts. First of all, <strong>you will get used to a lot of zeros</strong>, circles, rounds, nils... whatever you call it. Be positive, they are like smiley faces. You get them from serious posts, casual posts, serious relies, few word replies... all zero... O after O. sorry, O.O after O.O... If you are lucky, a 0.01 will make you smile all day!</p>

<p>Second of all. Not really so. <strong>Sometimes you do get lucky</strong>. The problem is you don't know how to get lucky again. Like me. I seriously wrote my introduction with passion like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/introduction/@deanliu/a-father-from-taiwan-thinking-introducing-myself-a-bit">&nbsp;A father from Taiwan, thinking ... introducing myself a bit...</a></p>
<p>But it's a 0.0. That's fine. It's a first time thing. I get it.</p>
<p>Then somehow I came across the idea of sharing <strong>my recent smoothie recipe</strong>. Just for fun as I really like the taste and can share with no one except my wife (she said it's the best juice she ever had). It's here (be careful, there is durian inside):</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/smoothie/@deanliu/share-my-recent-secret-smoothie-recipe-very-simple-super-good-but">&nbsp;Share my recent secret smoothie recipe - very simple super good but ...</a></p>
<p>Amazingly. It's payout is 10 dollar or so... which is unbelievable to me as I haven't even got ANY reward yet and this post is so casual and not serious... 10 equals 0.01 * 1000. Yes! 1000 times the minimal reward. I of course was thrilled and encouraged to write more..&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I decided to introduce <strong>a really inspiring story </strong>I've heard recently and it really gets me think deep about how my life should be. It's an amazing story by a Japanese young fellow. I typed every word by reorganizing the story from various sources... I thought this post should get a fair amount of attention, and of course some reasonable reward, though I indeed just hope to let more people know about it. here is the story:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://steemit.com/worldtouring/@deanliu/an-incredibly-inspiring-story-from-a-marvelous-japanese-young-man-yamada">An incredibly inspiring story from a marvelous Japanese young man Yamada ...</a></p>
<p>Well. So far, it is just an 5-vote and 0.48 dollar story. Sure, much better than 0.0 smiley face. But I just got confused. Which way should we go to know more about what the community wants?</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgsafe.org/1b99154dcd.jpg" width="1012" height="650"/></p>
<p>But it all become clear after I read @johnsmith article:</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/motivational/@johnsmith/why-the-steemwhales-are-upvoting-crap-instead-of-your-masterpiece-and-why-you-should-be-happy-about-it#@johnsmith/re-deanliu-re-johnsmith-why-the-steemwhales-are-upvoting-crap-instead-of-your-masterpiece-and-why-you-should-be-happy-about-it-20160722t063847525z">Why the Steemwhales are upvoting Crap instead of Your Masterpiece - And why you should be Happy About it</a></p>
<p>Seriously, don't worry about the payouts, let the big guys here worry. Have fun writing and sharing and good things will happen. Even if it doesn't, you had fun anyway.</p>
