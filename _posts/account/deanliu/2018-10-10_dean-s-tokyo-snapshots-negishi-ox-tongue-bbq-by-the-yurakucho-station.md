Walking beside the building of the Yurakucho Station, there are quite a few restaurants that are right underneath the station structure...

We have done some homework and picked this NEGISHI Ox Tongue BBQ restaurant.

When we arrived, there were very few customers inside and it was almost 6pm. We guess it was too *early* for locals... ^^

We ordered three sets: ox tongue, bbq combination and chicken bbq. Love them all! BBQ meat really goes well with rice. Pure pleasure...

It's a sin not to have some beer to go with your bbq meats. But I can't drink too much so we only order one mug.

Very nice dining experience and it is not expensive at all by Tokyo standards...

*this **Dean's Tokyo Snapshots** series ( #dean-tokyo as a specific tag) is my photographic diary for my family trip to Tokyo. Due to busy schedule and a naughty boy with us, I won't be able to write much but I will make sure that every photo that I choose means something, at least to me... I hope you enjoy this photo series as well as me! Feel free to comment but I probably won't have much time making replies often. Apologies first. :p*

***follow me @deanliu if you haven't! or not, if this does not interest you...^^***
