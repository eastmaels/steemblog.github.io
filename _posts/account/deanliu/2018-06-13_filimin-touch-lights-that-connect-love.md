***Disclaimer - This is a steemhunt-style post submitted from Steemit.com, not [SteemHunt.com](https://steemhunt.com) because I spent 2 hours working on this and only to find out that this product had been hunted [before](https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@thabiggdogg/long-distance-friendship-lamp-light-up-loved-ones-lives-across-town-or-the-whole-country). I cannot waste my hardwork and I certainly don't want to violate the rules of steemhunt so I still post it via steemit. I did not notice the warning from steemhunt.com and my own due diligence (goolge) did not reflect this fact too.***

## Hunter's comment

The website of Filimin starts with this sentence:

>Sometimes it's difficult to tell someone you love them.

So, Filimin, a.k.a [Long Distance Friendship Lamp](https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/long-distance-friendship-lamp) (the link is also the only sales channel in 2018 for Filimin), created these ***decorative touch lights that connect you with those you love***.

In the 21st century, many people are constantly changing the place they live in and in many cases have to sacrifice the privileges of staying near with their loved ones - parents, grand parents, friends and sometimes, spouse and kids... How devastating!!

We all know that technology nowadays can connect any two people around the globe instantly and effortlessly via audios and videos. Yeah, but we don't always stay *connected* and sometimes love is better conveyed through actions than words. 

Filimin has come up with such a unique and innovative way for us to send a love signal to love ones hundreds or thousands miles away by simply touching the light in your room. A truly remarkable idea and a great combination of technology and people's true need. 

In addition, Filimin lights share more love as these lights "*are assembled, tested and packed at **Womenâ€™s Initiative Network ([WIN](http://www.wichitawin.org/))** - a small non-profit organization in Wichita, Kansas which helps women in their journey from abusive situations to independence and the workforce.*"

You may see how many Filimin lights are online around the world in a live map on their website like the following...
