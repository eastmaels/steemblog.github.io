Does [Electroneum](https://electroneum.com/) sound familiar to you? The mobile cryptocurrency they claim to be. It was a very hot ICO in 2017. I am not gonna tell you what it is as there is clearly so much info out there and despite the latest [ouch! news](https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/03/cryptocurrencies-to-avoid/) (I don't think it's that bad)

I am going to share my **mobile mining** experience with you only. I think I am very late to the party, but a lot of people could be even later so I think I can introduce it to you as it is really great so far for me - **almost zero cost, some coin income almost passively and really low entry barrier**! Yeah, my mobile phone is at best average in terms of CPU power so most of you out there can outperform me easily.

A bad news for iphone users - this is only for Android smartphones so far (you can try your luck goggling some geek way for doing this though). So, Android phone users! [Download this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.electroneum.mobile) and install it and do whatever you need to register then you can see this mining page.

Click the blue **START MINING** button and you are my fellow miner now!!

Then you will see your phone start to "mine". See my Hash-rate is only 28 H/s and this is my top speed! If you open too many Apps this number will decrease and supposedly your mined rewards will drop. As I recall, good phones can have up to something like 80H/s that is more than two times my speed!

An important reminder - Electroneum currently *do not* really use your phone to perform computations (aka mining). They said that your phone will only be *simulated* to so they can know your computing capacity and you can get a feeling of mining. So, that's why it seems not having impact to my usual usage of my phone - electricity consuming feels the same, processing speed seems normal too and of course it won't heat up. For now of course.  

So I keep it running in the background like 24 hrs and I close all Apps except it when I don't use my phone.

The **ETN** (Electroneum token) you mined will show in the "**Pending Balance**" on mining page and once this amount exceeds the Payout Amount (which is set at 10 ETN now), it will be automatically transferred to your ETN wallet here.

You can see the transaction record of mine below the available balance. 

See I have earned **50 ETNs** from my 10 (?) days of mining!! No ASICs, No PC/Mac, No cloud mining rented. Just your phone and at the moment it does not consume much power.

<br><br>

On the **VALUE** tab, you get to see how ETN the token is doing - price, circulation, market cap, 24h volume, price changes... 

So you can easily get information about how much the coins you mined is worth ... Who knows? Maybe you will even invest some ...

<br><br>

Hang on, there is even a more handy tool for you to easily calculate how much your wallet is worth or whatever amount you wish to know.

$1.6 for me in 10 days! Well, not really that much, but what did I do to get them? Not much ... I am very satisfied. Besides, the price might go up in the future so I am accumulating everyday! Nice!

Okay okay, there is always ways to earn more coins ... yeah, referrals! So, here is the "Earn Free Coins" part. There seems to be a weekly prize of **5000 ETNs** for people who refers friends to join this mobile mining.

It seems they do not provide you with referral links but only referral code or you can use QR code as well. To be qualified for this contest, you not only need to introduce friends here and you also need to enter a referral code to qualify.

See!? I did not start introducing this until now as I want to make sure this whole process is smooth and fuss-free. It is! So I write a post today so I can let more people know this good stuff and at the same time maybe you will consider using my referral code if you like this mining experience sharing.

**I will, however, use the first people's referral code if s/he uses my ref code and reply below!** Maybe I cannot verify if you do use my code, but I will trust if you say so!

中文區朋友們好！我就簡單說一下這一篇的重點。我介紹了[Electroeum](https://electroneum.com/)這個移動挖礦幣的“挖礦”經驗：非常輕鬆，幾乎無門檻。雖然這個ETN幣幣值很低，但反正你幾乎沒損失，只要你使用安卓手機，就可以下載來試試看。我挖了約10天，挖到50顆了，價值目前約1.6刀。

這裡的挖礦目前其實是假的，並不耗你CPU資源，所以當然也不太多耗電，這是他們希望給用戶一個手機挖礦的“感覺”以及取得你手機運算力的模擬值以便他們下一步動作。總之，你就開著它，全天開，不太有感覺的。但記得把其他不用的App都關一關，這樣你的Hash rate才能高一點。

我的手機很一般般的，所以我猜你們的應該多半都可以超越我的28H/s，獲益率更高。反正就是開著，比什麼社交挖礦的不費心多了，幾乎不管它喔！試試看吧！還能參加介紹人參加免費幣抽獎之類的，歡迎用我上面的介紹碼！第一位回覆說用了我的碼註冊的人我會用他的碼輸入我的介紹人喔（對，我的還空著）！

反正是好玩，歡迎你一起來當礦工！^_^
