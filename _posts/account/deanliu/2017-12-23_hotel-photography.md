The purpose of this post is to share these photos I shot in a hotel that [I stay recently](https://steemit.com/christmas-countdown/@deanliu/christmas-countdown-in-taipei-6-finale). I really like to take pictures when I stay in a hotel (especially luxurious ones) as the rooms are normally designed and renovated to let you relax and appreciate. Hotel photography is always part of my staying experience with most hotels. :)

Of course, these are not to be considered some *introductory photos* of how these hotel rooms look like, but they are *my* photography work with my own angles. By the way, the kid is my son. ^^
