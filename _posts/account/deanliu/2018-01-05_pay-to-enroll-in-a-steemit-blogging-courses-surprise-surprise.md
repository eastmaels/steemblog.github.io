Today I was thinking *okay it's 2018 now and I should do something really meaningful to kick start this new year*, so the first thing that came to my mind is to *learn something useful online*. I know there are really so much resources online that can help you with learning virtually *anything* as long as it's not too professional or obscure, and the amazing part is that normally these are not expensive or even *free*!! 

So I ended up finding this amazing self-learning platform [udemy](https://www.udemy.com) and they are having a new year promotion for most of their online courses for $NT 330, which is about $11-$12. I decided to look for programming courses and since I've heard python so many times since I came here, I found some that look like good basic courses. Somehow I got some basic senses of what this is about just by watching those demo videos and I am still undecided if I am gonna pay and learn it.

But that's not the main point of this post. Along the way, surprisingly, I found out that ***[there are eleven existing udemy courses about Steemit](https://www.udemy.com/topic/steemit/)***!!!

Ouch!! I have never known this kind of courses exist and I cannot imagine that people would pay to register in these kind of courses!! It seems you can not only *blogging to get paid*, but you can also *teaching how to "blogging to get paid" to get paid* !! Wow~~~ this really opens my eyes ...

Obviously this website is a platform for courses - you can be students and you can be teachers if you want. I am pretty sure I know no less than most of these Steemit teachers about this platform (my guess only since I did not really pay to watch these course), so it means I can also do this in the future! woohoo~~ Besides, there is no Chinese language versions! ^_^

Maybe these courses are just like so many posts on Steemit that no one reads, and they might not have many students... Let's take a look at the top 3 courses.

Hey, only these three courses and they have **a total of 16,909 students**!!! Remember, these people *paid* to learn how to blog (and earn) on Steemit! I am sure that a very high percentage of them all have become Steemians. Remember there are still other 8 courses that I did not check. The number would be much higher... 

*If you are one of these eleven tutors, share your experience with us alright*? Thanks!

Things really have changed... if you've got something that is valuable to others, anyone out there that can go online, then there are various ways for you to *sell* what you have to those others. Blockchain has enabled this even further. 

**Amazing world ahead ladies and gentlemen!**
