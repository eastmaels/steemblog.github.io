<p><em>I was gonna write something else but somehow I took some time to check how the</em><em><strong> robinhoodwhale</strong></em><em> project is doing... Cannot express enough how much I love this project and how much I respect the team members... But still, I feel that I should share what I have seen and to let more people know that we should do as much as we can to keep this project going.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>TRUTH 1</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Steemit is not doing so well recently in terms of new account creation and posts per day (pic from <a href="https://steemle.com/charts.php">steemle.com</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/steemperform42646.png</p>
<ul>
  <li>The distribution of Steem, despite the equalizing trend, in terms of MVs, is EXTREMELY unequal (this is a fact but with historical reasons) - Top 100 accounts, excluding the company account @steemit, controls more than 76% of MVs!! (source is <a href="https://steemit.com/steem-stats/@hisnameisolllie/steemit-statistics-week-6-0-14-0-update-and-more">here </a>by @hisnameisolllie ) And yes, this percentage is indeed falling, as many whales are powering down.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TRUTH 2</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Our beloved whale - @robinhoodwhale - is hardly a real whale (there is no formal definition for whales). Maybe at best a mini whale... Currently with roughly 13,500 SPs or 42.5 MVs...&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Relatively speaking,&nbsp;@robinhoodwhale ...&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Ranks #373 currently (from <a href="https://steemd.com/richlist">richlist</a>). You would think @robinhoodwhale should at least tops first 100 right!? (<a href="https://steemit.com/design/@kyriacos/the-making-of-robinhoodwhale-brand-design-logo-presentation">RHW logo</a> from @kyriacos )</p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/rankbe6ba.png</p>
<p>Currently only compare to at best one hundredth of Top 10 accounts (or 9 if you want).&nbsp;It is no comparison at all. These numbers refer to each Top 10 account's relative size to RHW in terms of MVs.</p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/RHWs4c7c3.png&nbsp;</p>
<p>With each upvoting worth <strong>$0.7</strong>. Not really impressive at the moment. A vote from RHW is an <strong>honor and a signal that your post is good</strong>!!</p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/VP6f484.png</p>
<p><code><strong>Update</strong></code><code>.</code> Sorry that I posted this piece in a hurry and I felt something didn't add up as RHW's vote seems to be much more powerful than the above. I did think of the following upvotes but couldn't find data in a short time. So, <strong>RHW to the rescue again</strong>!! @repholder has commented that RHW's upvote is around $20+, which would be the equivalence of above <strong>the 40th largest whale at its 100%VP</strong>!! That's really good! (maybe this is a clue for further analysis and yet another POST!? ) Thank you @repholder !!</p>
<blockquote>RHW might not be a big whale in terms of SP but each upvote is $20+ due to our bot followers and Steemian trail.The latest one we upvoted was at $0.02 currently $29+ 5minutes later.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p><strong>TRUTH 3</strong></p>
<p>We are not doing enough for @robinhoodwhale&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>from big investors: only a biggest investment/support from @teamsmooth of $5000 SPs and 2 investments around $1000 SPs</li>
  <li>from the crowd: total number of investors/supporters is only 70!!&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Investment only surged during the <strong>first 3 days</strong> after <a href="https://steemit.com/robinhoodwhale/@robinhoodwhale/announcing-robinhoodwhale-the-steemit-deep-sea-savior">the official announcement </a>of RobinHoodWhale on Aug 29 and this is most due to the large investment mentioned. The trend goes flat since then.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HOW DO WE CHANGE THIS?</strong></p>
<p>From the above truth, let's go through some possible ways out of it...</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ask more minnows and dolphins to invest/support RHW</strong>: despite it is encouraging and inspiring and all, it is NOT gonna work at least in the short run as you see how wealth is highly concentrated. Given a downward Steem price trend, most people won't invest aggressively so as to drastically change distribution</li>
  <li><strong>Make RHW a more attractive investment for real whales</strong>: business is business. If we can make this profitable, most likely is to demonstrate that this project does help tremendously discover and keep quality bloggers, then it would be profitable (not directly from this project but indirectly from making Steemit better) for whales to sponsor more although free riding might exist. Still, this is vague and probably the respectable and intelligent team members are just planning to go this way...</li>
  <li><strong>Grow at faster speed by posting more!!</strong> Posting is another way for real whales to support this project without investing their real assets. check this out - @robinhoodwhale has <strong>only posted twice but earned three thousands</strong>! This is almost <strong>one quarter of its total SPs</strong>!! It means @robinhoodwhale should post more often so whales, dolphins and minnows can have the chance to help WITHOUT investing.&nbsp;Also, all team members should also post relevant topics as I think you all deserve to be highly compensated for your contribution (so we can enjoy your excellent talent with sustainability :D)!&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WHAT MOST OF US CAN DO NOW</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Follow its progress, have your opinions, do some research or analysis or even draw a picture if that's what you are good at... and then <strong>POST!!</strong> -- you can keep your SPs and <strong>donate/invest all or some of the SDs to this project</strong> to keep this issue hot and trendy. And that's what triggers me to do this one so of course ALL SDs from this post goes to the RHW project as investment (yes, not donation, so everyone is more incentivized to do the same!) Use the tag <strong>RobinHoodWhale</strong> . We should have a lot more posts using this tag and create many more channels for the big guys to transmit their resources to feed our beloved whale baby!</li>
  <li>.... You thoughts or ideas on this!?</li>
  <li><strong>If not, start posting today!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>I wish to promote this idea more so I include the #cn tag but don't have time to translate all content. So I will just briefly say to cn users in the following (oh btw our @laonie is also a important member in this team! hooray!)...</em></p>
<p>cn區的朋友們大家好！這篇主要是要鼓吹大家盡量多寫關於羅賓鯨 RobinHoodWhale 行動的相關文章。因為現在的羅賓鯨實在頂多是鯨魚寶寶，排行不上前百，前十名的大鯨都是它的百倍大！但以目前的資產分布來看，根本不可能由小魚小豚的投資或捐獻來餵養它長夠大，<strong>我認為只有羅賓鯨以及其團隊成員多寫稿，大家想幫忙的也多寫稿，可以把收入的SD全數或部分再投資到 @robinhoodwhale 當中</strong>，這可能是比較可行之道！這也是本帖由來。因此本帖全數SD將投資至此行動，每個人都可以做的，討論、研究甚至畫圖的都可以，而且不是捐獻，是投資！助人助己，正是Steemit的鯨神啊！(抱歉未及翻譯，可以自行看英文內容)</p>
<p><em>Note. I still have to clarify that in no way this post is to underestimate the efforts from all team members. I figure they must have great plans ahead as this project is really so young and indeed has achieved so much! But we, as common fishes, should still try to help instead of waiting for these devoting guys to do all the good deeds! </em><em><strong>Thanks to them again!!</strong></em></p>
