<p>It is envisaged at the moment that a huge influx of Chinese-using users to Steemit is inevitable. Language will become an urgent issue to deal with for the development of this community (of course I acknowledge the fact that a lot of non-English languages have been active here and a lot more will come as well). What I think of right now is that I came across many high quality English posts from time to time but if there is no translation (into Chinese), it is expected that a big portion of the future Chinese users won’t be able to read or digest them to a certain degree, which is a great pity and hinders communication and sharing among different groups of people. There have been some translators’ efforts like @benjojo ‘s <a href="https://steemit.com/translation/@benjojo/translation-services-list">Translation Services List</a>. But the problem is even if someone does the translation job, it gives rise to the problem of double rewarding (despite that fact that translation should also be rewarded accordingly) or potential plagiarism. It may be partly resolved by the private negotiation between the author and the translator on authorization and profit sharing. But I don’t think that’s a permanent or systematic way to solve this issue. So far I can only raise the question, but no proper solution is on my mind – maybe that’s what @dan and @ned should consider next. </p>

<p>看來遲早大量中文使用者即將快速湧入Steemit，語言成為此社群一個需要思考的問題。現在想到的是，我常常看到許多高品質的英文文章，但如果沒有翻譯，可能中文社群很多人會無法看到或是吸收不良，這是很可惜的(未來若是中文興起，反之亦然)。如果有人投身翻譯，在這會碰到授權/剽竊或是重複獎賞的問題(當然翻譯工作本身是值得獎賞的)，雖然某種程度可以透過翻譯者與作者的授權與分享利潤協議來解決，似乎不能作為一種妥善的解方。拋個問題，沒有答案，或許是管理者未來該思考的。  </p>
