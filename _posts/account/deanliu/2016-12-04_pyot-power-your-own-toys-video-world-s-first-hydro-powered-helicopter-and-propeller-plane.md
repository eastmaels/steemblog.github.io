<p>I've done some toy DIY posts before this one, the MYOT series ...</p>

<p>This time ... IT GETS EASIER!! No need to MAKE, this time just use your daily tool smartly on TOYS and you and your little ones might find it so much FUN!!</p>
<p>When you are playing with your kids in the garden, and you have toys like the helicopter and the propeller plane in the following photo that are not powered in any way (electrical, mechanical ... ) ... &nbsp;</p>

<p>See how they can COME TO LIFE if you properly aim your water hose at the rotors and propellers. Adjust the water shooting speed by placing your finger over part of the tip of the hose. Then adjust the angle to aim the target properly so as to <strong>POWER IT UP</strong>!! You might need a little bit of practice to get it going ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>See the case with <strong>the HELICOPTER</strong>!! If you look carefully enough, you can see that both the main rotor and the tail rotor are spinning!! Well, the helicopter doesn't really fly though... :-) &nbsp;</p>

<p>The the case with <strong>the PROPELLER PLANE</strong>!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>My boy is crazy about it. At first, he stared at them when I did this. Then he asked to try himself and obviously this kind of delicate hand movement is not quite easy for small kids. But he had fun practicing it for quite a long time and finally he got them spinning from time to time and that is absolutely enough for him! For me too, now I can focus on editing my photos for sharing on Steemit when he is playing this.</p>
<p><strong>Hydro-powered helicopter and propeller plane</strong>...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy this tip! More MYOT on the way soon! :-)</p>
