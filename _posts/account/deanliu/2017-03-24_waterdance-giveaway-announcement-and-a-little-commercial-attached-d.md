<p><strong>Thank You Everyone Who Upvoted and Participated My Previous Waterdance Post!!</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/waterdance/@deanliu/pick-your-favorite-bitan-waterdance-photo-and-win-5-steems">Pick your favorite Bitan Waterdance Photo and Win 5 Steems</a></p>
<p>It is time to announce! And..... <strong>the winner is</strong>.... [<em>music</em>] ......</p>
<p><strong>EVERYONE!! Woo Hoo!! :D</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>No, just kidding</strong></em>... I cannot make everyone a winner or it wouldn't be winner at all, right? But actually, thanks to @gavvet and his friends, many comments/entries were nicely rewarded, even much more than my prizes!! Thanks! Gavvet!! Now it is time to get serious... But before we do announcement, I think I need to apologize for not making the contest more clear - as I stated in that post that the prize will go to "three most <em>creative </em>comments" but I did not emphasize it. Probably that's why everyone seemed to try picking what they thought would be the winning photo in my mind. No, I don't care which one you pick, as long as your comment is <em><strong>creative </strong></em>enough! Still, I chose the winner based on this criteria, without considering if they've got <em>the gavvet's vote</em>. :D</p>
<h3><strong>the winner is</strong>.... [<em>music, </em><em><strong>stronger</strong></em>] ...... <em>who can get </em><em><strong>5</strong></em><em> steems each</em> ....</h3>
<p>@crazymumzysa - for describing <code>the feeling of an escape from the birdcage</code>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@team101 - for saying <code>&nbsp;I like being identified with number 1</code>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Well done, guys!! Will transfer 5 steems to you soon!! Congratulations!!&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>To put it simply, Me and 4 other senior steemians decided to open a small tea house - LAODR Tea House. So everyone can chat there. Now mainly for Chinese users, but you can join too! Drink tea after you finish champagne! lol. Check it out here:</p>
