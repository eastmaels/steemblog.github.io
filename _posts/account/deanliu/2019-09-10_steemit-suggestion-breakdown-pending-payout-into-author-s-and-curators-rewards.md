So now we have "New Steem", we should **reconsider how we display the pending payout of a post.**

Why? Because with "Old Steem" when people misunderstood the displayed payout to be solely enjoyed by the author, s/he would only be let down by roughly 25%. And now with New Steem, this disappointment increases to a potential 50%!

Unless we are willing to consider a whole new way for displaying pending payout like showing separately author's and curators', or we should try to avoid letting down our *new* coming users (I hope so).

Besides, current breakdown is simply wrong, if not only nearly useless - since we now have 50/50, the final reward will only have 1/4 of it liquid (half of author's reward), making the breakdown ratio roughly 1:3 (yeah, I know, plenty of SP, meaning a higher tendency to power down)

Anyway, my suggestion is, instead of the following

>Pending payout amount: $10
>Breakdown: 0 SBD, 30 STEEM, 30 SP

we should have:

>Pending payout amount: $10
>Breakdown: Author $5, Curators $5 (roughly)
 
What do you think!?
