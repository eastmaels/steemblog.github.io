<p>Recently I am browsing around to look for job offerings in the blockchain related area. I am just curious because as I don't have coding expertise but wish to participate in this growing new business (<em>it is </em>much <em>appreciated if anyone can give me </em><em><strong>any </strong></em><em>suggestions</em>), still I want to know what others are doing. Today I found a very weird job opening on the website of <em>Japan's number one bitcoin exchange</em>, <a href="https://bitflyer.jp/">bitFlyer</a>. It is a "<strong>Blockchain Engineer</strong>" offering so I am very interested in what qualifications this position requires (not like I can do it any time soon, but am curious about what this term means only).</p>
<p>But I cannot understand at all as it is not in English.</p>
<p>Follow me. I will show you and hopefully someone can tell me if this is simply an error or actually a test to a potential applicant. If it is the latter, then it is <em><strong>really cool</strong></em>! It will at least be <em><strong>funny </strong></em>if the former is the case.</p>
<h3>Okay. Go to <a href="https://bitflyer.jp/">the website </a>and choose English as the language.&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Here comes the mystery ... Blockchain Engineer!! Is this the conversation over the "bit dimension" so I cannot understand it??&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>It allows you to enter a string so I did. And it says "Wrong Answer" after submission. LOL!</h3>

<h3>Since it allows you to submit something, so I reckon it is probably an answer to the above test? Logical argument right? .... Anyhow, enlighten me! Anyone? :)</h3>
