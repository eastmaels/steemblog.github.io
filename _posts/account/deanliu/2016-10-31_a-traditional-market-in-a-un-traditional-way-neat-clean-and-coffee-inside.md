<p><strong>2 months ago, I had shown you how a traditional market in Taiwan looks like .. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/life/@deanliu/follow-me-grocery-shopping-in-a-traditional-chinese-market-in-taiwan">Follow me grocery shopping in a traditional Chinese market in Taiwan 台灣傳統市場走一回</a></p>
<p>But it is a common market - nothing new to us locals. <strong>This time let me show you the best of the best, from locals' view, traditional market here. Shi Dong market is located in Tian Mu, </strong>a neighborhood located in northern Taipei. Tian Mu is best known as an enclave for Taiwan's US expatriate community. From the mid 1950s to 1979, when the US broke formal ties with Taiwan, large portions of the US Armed Forces and their families stationed in Taiwan lived here.<strong> So this place has the western (American) ambiance since then - food, restaurants, stores, ... you can find a western way of life here. So no surprise a lot of foreigners live here.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>See </strong><a href="https://steemit.com/life/@deanliu/enough-halloween-stuffs-for-me-except-this-one"><strong>my previous post for Tian Mu 's street in Halloween decorations!</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>台北的天母是過去美軍駐地，因此此處留下許多美國式西方式的元素與生活，餐廳、食物與衣服、酒吧等等，甚至很多在台灣的西方人都選擇住在天母。</strong></p>
<p><strong>However, Shi Dong market is still just a traditional market and what is </strong><em><strong>un</strong></em><strong>-traditional is that it is neat and clean... It is even air-conditioned! </strong>People here often regard it as the most modern traditional market in Taiwan ... but whether it is most likable it really depends ... some people don't like markets to be too clean, if you know what I mean ... <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Still, it is quite nice for me to finally have a chance to check it out (it is not subway friendly). So I share this experience with you here. <strong>This time I just show you the first floor. </strong>Next time we can go upstairs to check the food court and the delicious meal we had.</p>
<p><strong>不過，我要介紹的天母士東市場，畢竟還是傳統市場，號稱全台最先進的市場，乾淨明亮，甚至有空調。當然，很多人其實喜歡略為髒髒的市場，哈哈！這次我們先看1樓，2樓式美食區，下次再分享好吃的食物。</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let's go!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vegetables and fruits ... neatly assorted and displayed. 蔬菜水果，擺放整齊。</strong></p>
