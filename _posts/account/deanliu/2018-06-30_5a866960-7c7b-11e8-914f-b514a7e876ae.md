Today is my family's first ever trip to the Taipei Astronomical Museum and it was so interesting and my son TT loves it so much!

The most eye-opening activity is no doubt the "Cosmic Adventure"!! I quote their introduction below based on their [website](https://en.tam.gov.taipei/cp.aspx?n=BEFC8BB2A5DB88D9)- 

>The story begins in the 25th Century, where traveling in space is already public tourism. Everyone will take a journey of the solar system each year. However the universe is still full of unknown matters. Therefore each journey brings the tourists with infinite expectation and surprises. Along the 200-meter track, the Cosmic Adventure uses films, lighting, scenes and special effects interchangeably to create magnificent views of the outer space, turning the limited space into infinite surprises. Taking the low-speed and closed compartment gives you a perception of controlling the spacecraft. Such 10 minutes ride will bring you a life-time experience of unforgettable cosmic adventures.

Anything I said wouldn't be more vivid than watching the video yourself so I recommend anyone interested to watch it and get the idea! I'd say it is much more than an educational tour but definitely qualifies as a spot-on tourist activity! I enjoyed it A LOT!! For your information, the cost is roughly 2 SBDs only!!

A reminder - the narrator's language is Mandarin Chinese so English audience needs to use their imagination a little bit! But you will be given the option of English when you enter your *spaceship*! ^_<

Lastly, some teasers for you ... there are comets, blackholes, and even *aliens* inside!! What are you waiting for!?

中文區朋友們，這是我們一家今天去台北天文科學教育館裡面，所搭乘的『宇宙探險』！超酷的，遠遠超出我的預期（實際搭乘比影像刺激十倍吧！）。邀請你一起跟我，搭乘宇宙飛船，在宇宙間旅行，可能會碰上彗星、黑洞，還有還有外星生物啊！！^^
