<p>The day before yesterday, I witnessed an interesting glitch of Poloniex that has given me 1 second of being a rich man with <strong>997 </strong>bitcoins (the post is <a href="https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@deanliu/being-rich-for-1-second-you-can-do-it-too-on-poloniex-i-did-i-have-sorry-had-997-bitcoins">here</a>, and you can still make me closer to that <em>dream</em>). Very few people around me knows about bitcoins and all, I have no one to share except dear Steemians. So I spent like 15 minutes writing it up just for <em>sharing </em>the fun.</p>
<p>I did not expect it to reach a currently <em>eighty dollar</em> something payout level at all! Higher than those posts that I spent hours arranging photos selected from my trips, or contemplating ideas and trying to organize it in an interesting and neat way ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>My post payouts have been quite alright lately, not really comparable to top or even second tier bloggers (by a digit at least!), but enough to make me grateful for being blessed (see those posts by new authors? hang in there guys!). The point is - what makes them, my own posts, different from each other in terms of payouts?</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@deanliu/being-rich-for-1-second-you-can-do-it-too-on-poloniex-i-did-i-have-sorry-had-997-bitcoins">This fun and impromptu post</a> obviously grabs more attention from readers or curators ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you think - it might be just one whale that accidentally sees it and upvotes it... you cannot generalize it.... Yeah, good for you, you've got the <em>essence </em>of Steemit! :)</p>
<h3>Record High Pageview for Me!!</h3>
<p><br>
However, no, I have further evidence - the "pageviews" (<em>something that is not on the blockchain, probably a Steemit UI stats</em>). This post has generated <strong>126 pageviews</strong> so far!! The highest number from my own posts to my memory!! (this number is not accurate for some much older posts as it was introduced half way and been broken for a few time). Even compared with my recent posts with higher payouts, the pageview is under 100 and sometimes less than 50.</p>

<p>Obviously everyone loves to be generally rewarded by higher payouts. But over the past months of blogging, <em><strong>pageview has always been a secret measure of my own satisfaction from blogging other than payouts</strong></em>. Because it means someone does read your post!! And that makes me feel good!</p>
<p>And now it is this post that seems to achieve the climax of this index ... <em>What does it mean?</em></p>
<p>For now, <strong>my conclusion is</strong> - people are really attractive by keywords like <em>getting rich</em>, <em>wealth</em>, <em>investment </em>...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naturally. This is a <em>blog-and-get-paid</em> site and people come to blog and ... yes, get <em>paid </em>or get <em>rich</em>, even better. Nothing really wrong about it.</p>
<p>But if we, as bloggers, have to write something about getting rich, so we can get rich.... Doesn't it sound a little bit ... <em>unsustainable</em>?</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't know. That's why I wrote this piece up. Maybe I will write more about money related posts, maybe not.</p>
<h3>A Powerful Concept from Ned</h3>
<p><br>
But I recall that our captain @ned brought this exciting term to our attention <em>eight months ago</em> - <em><strong>Attention Economy</strong></em> !! Yes!!</p>

<p>Please check this post by @mrosenquist if you are not familiar with this <em>history </em>..</p>
<p>https://steemit.com/steemit/@mrosenquist/attention-economy-of-steemit</p>
<p>To be honest, I haven't seen anything relevant being implemented since this term was brought up. Maybe the secret weapon is still waiting for the best timing to come out. It doesn't matter.</p>
<p>But, with the <strong>attention </strong>I am getting from my previous post, it seems most convenient to attract those who want to get money from this site, but then <em><strong>we </strong></em>will become more money centered and post more about it ... and then ... as I have asked earlier ....</p>
