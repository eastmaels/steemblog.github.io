My name is [SCOT](https://steemit.com/steem-engine/@aggroed/scot-and-scotbot-going-live-part-1-se-node-hardfork). Last [DEC](https://steemmonsters.com/), My [JCAR](https://steemit.com/@jcarvoting) went [SAVAGE](https://steempeak.com/@josephsavage) and then stopped [RORS](http://roadofrich.com/)ing. I thought the [ENG](https://steem-engine.com/)ine was down because there was some [STEEM](https://steempeak.com/@steem-peg). I called my [PAL](http://minnowsupportproject.org/) [JJM](https://steemit.com/@virus707) and he was on [WEED](https://www.weedcash.network/). I called [AAA](https://steempeak.com/@triplea.reviews) and they said they were "still in [BETA](https://steemmonsters.com/)"! [SHIT](https://steemit.com/@shitbot), No [TPU](https://tipu.online/) for them! I needed a [BEER](https://beersaturday.com/) so I entered a [MINI](https://steemit.com/@minigame)-[SHOP](https://steemit.com/@teamcn-shop). Mr [MEEP](https://steemit.com/@ionlysaymeep) were there and gave me a [HUG](https://steempeak.com/@applecrisp). The [LOVE](https://www.indextrader24.com/) was [EPC](https://epicdice.io/) and ended the [DRAMA](https://steem-engine.com/%20steemit.com/@dramatoken).

我名叫[SCOT](https://steemit.com/steem-engine/@aggroed/scot-and-scotbot-going-live-part-1-se-node-hardfork)，去年12月[DEC](https://steemmonsters.com/)，我的[JCAR](https://steemit.com/@jcarvoting)發狂[SAVAGE](https://steempeak.com/@josephsavage)了就不再轟隆隆[RORS](http://roadofrich.com/)了。我看到有些水汽 [STEEM](https://steempeak.com/@steem-peg)冒出來，覺得應該引擎 [ENG](https://steem-engine.com/)掛了。我打電話給我兄弟[PAL](http://minnowsupportproject.org/) [JJM](https://steemit.com/@virus707)，不過他正在抽大麻[WEED](https://www.weedcash.network/)。我又打給道路救援[AAA](https://steempeak.com/@triplea.reviews)，他們說還在試營運[BETA](https://steemmonsters.com/)！真是[SHIT](https://steemit.com/@shitbot)，他們沒小費[TPU](https://tipu.online/)可以拿了！我那時超想喝啤酒[BEER](https://beersaturday.com/)，所以走進一家小[MINI](https://steemit.com/@minigame)商店[SHOP](https://steemit.com/@teamcn-shop)，[MEEP](https://steemit.com/@ionlysaymeep)先生在裡面，給我一個大大的擁抱[HUG](https://steempeak.com/@applecrisp)，這份愛[LOVE](https://www.indextrader24.com/)實在太經典[EPC](https://epicdice.io/)，終於結束了這場鬧劇[DRAMA](https://steem-engine.com/%20steemit.com/@dramatoken)。

저는 [SCOT](https://steemit.com/steem-engine/@aggroed/scot-and-scotbot-going-live-part-1-se-node-hardfork) 이예요. 작년 12월[DEC](https://steemmonsters.com/)에, 제 [JCAR](https://steemit.com/@jcarvoting)는 미쳐[SAVAGE](https://steempeak.com/@josephsavage)져서 우르릉[RORS](http://roadofrich.com/)소리가 나지않았어요. 그때 수증기[STEEM](https://steempeak.com/@steem-peg)가 보였어요. 엔진[ENG](https://steem-engine.com/)고장이 난모양이예요. 그래서 제 친구[PAL](http://minnowsupportproject.org/) [JJM](https://steemit.com/@virus707)에게 전화를 했어요. 근데 쟤가 대마초[WEED](https://www.weedcash.network/)를 피우고 있대요. 그래서 저는 도로구원[AAA](https://steempeak.com/@triplea.reviews)을 연락했어요. 그렇지만 아직 테스트영업/시영업?[BETA](https://steemmonsters.com/)중 있대요! [SHIT](https://steemit.com/@shitbot), 쟤들은 팁[TPU](https://tipu.online/)을 받지 못할 거이었어요! 그때 맥주[BEER](https://beersaturday.com/)를 너무 마시고 싶어서 한 미니[MINI](https://steemit.com/@minigame)숍[SHOP](https://steemit.com/@teamcn-shop)에 들어갔어요. 거기에 [MEEP](https://steemit.com/@ionlysaymeep)씨가 있더라고요. MEEP씨기 포옹[HUG](https://steempeak.com/@applecrisp)해줬어요. 이사랑[LOVE](https://www.indextrader24.com/)이 너무 특별[EPC](https://epicdice.io/)하고 이 사랑은 드라마[DRAMA](https://steem-engine.com/%20steemit.com/@dramatoken)를 끝냈어요.
