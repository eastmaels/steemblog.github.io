With Bitcoin price rising so fast and ouch, I investigate again its market cap against those big giants in the world. As per the moment I write this post, Bitcoin has a marketcap of 293 billion US dollars.

From a source named Statista (*data date is in April but still approximately usable I think*), the world's most valuable company is no surprise Apple from the US with a market cap of 752B! Well done! The 2nd one is Alphabet (aka Google) with 579.5B. Again, no surprise.

So, Bitcoin, if viewed as a company, where would it be on the list?

### Number 10 now!!

<br>Replacing Tencent from China and chasing JPMorgan #9! Even so, I assume it may @surpassinggoogle and @surpassingapple soon, although might not happen this year but definitely within one year...

It's also interesting to compare cryptocurrency as a whole. The total marketcap is 443B. This would be #3 between Microsoft and Amazon now. 

This comparison is for fun and to give you some sense about how big these coins are, but of course cryptocurrencies are *very very* different from companies.

If you are wondering how #2 and onward cryptocurrencies' ranking, well, I can tell you that all of them are off the table as the last (#100) one Mitsubishi has a marketcap of 83.9B. Still twice as large as Ethereum.

For your information and leisure. ^_^
