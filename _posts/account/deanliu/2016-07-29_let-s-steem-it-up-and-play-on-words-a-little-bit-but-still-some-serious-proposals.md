<p>Since Steem is in its infancy (oh man what a huge baby it is!), and </p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@steemitblog/steemit-com-is-now-open-source">Steemit.com is now Open Source</a></p>
<p>A lot of names will be needed for its ecosystem. So, let's give it a try. I will start with a few:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ecosysteem</strong> - naturally referring to Steem's ecosystem. can be used as a tag.</li>
  <li><strong>Episteemology</strong> - all the research on Steem. sound very professional, huh?</li>
  <li><strong>Steemina</strong> - well, can this replace 'voting power'? would be more fun!</li>
  <li><strong>Steemtroduction</strong> - yeah, I know everyone #introduceyourself. maybe we can use this as a new tag for launching new services, new apps, new tools for Steem? like the lauch of <a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@roelandp/celebrating-40-000-steemit-users-with-steemstory-com-what-s-your-story">SteemStory.com</a> and etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>How are these? Oh, they are also great account names if not occupied yet... </p>
<p>Care to share some of your ideas? One day, Steem will become mainsteem ... oops, another one!</p>
