It is said that here has the most intense Matcha (powdered Japanese green tea) Ice Cream of the world!! So we came here to find out (just excuses... ha)

It is located on a common road in Asakusa (Ê∑∫Ëçâ) near the famous Sensoji tourist area.

A small store. Packed with customers from all over the world. Lots of people from Taiwan I think.

WOW! So cool there were some ladies coming in wearing Kimonos (Japanese traditional garment). ‚ù§Ô∏èÔΩûÔΩûÔΩû

Lots of  flavors but matcha is obviously the main appeal.

Try some!? Oh it is indeed yum.... I don't care how much tea inside, but it's yummy and that's enough for me. ^^

Strawberry for my kid and sesame for my wife. Sesame is also very good...

*this **Dean's Tokyo Snapshots** series ( #dean-tokyo as a specific tag) is my photographic diary for my family trip to Tokyo. Due to busy schedule and a naughty boy with us, I won't be able to write much but I will make sure that every photo that I choose means something, at least to me... I hope you enjoy this photo series as well as me! Feel free to comment but I probably won't have much time making replies often. Apologies first. :p*

***follow me @deanliu if you haven't! or not, if this does not interest you...^^***
