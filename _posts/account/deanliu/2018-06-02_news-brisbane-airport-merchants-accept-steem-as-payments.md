News just have it: [Brisbane International is Now the Worldâ€™s First Crypto-Friendly Airport](https://news.bitcoin.com/brisbane-international-is-now-the-worlds-first-crypto-friendly-airport/)

There was actually an old news several months ago when the Brisbane Airport in Australia announced that they were *preparing to accept cryptocurrencies*. Now it has become reality and ...

>all the merchants and airport terminals accept various digital assets such as bitcoin core, dash, bitcoin cash, ethereum, nem, and steem making it one of the friendliest cryptocurrency airports in the world.

Yes, that's right!! Steem is among the list of the accepted cryptocurrencies of Six!! This is fantastic news for Steemians who are traveling to or via Brisbane, the third largest city of Australia! 

The company behind this is an Australian startup called [Travelbybit](https://www.travelbybit.com/). You can check their website, check [an article](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@scooter77/retailers-accepting-steem-in-brisbane-australia-travelbybit) posted by fellow Steemian 4 months ago and even follow their official Steemit account @travelbybit (yes, they are here! but not updated for quite some time) ...

But, actually I cannot find evidence, other than the news yesterday, from the company's website that Steem is currently being accepted or is still just a plan yet to be realized. So, **if you are thinking about going to Brisbane Airport very recently and planning to use your Steem, do call them and make sure this has been added okay?**

I am really excited by this news and look forward to a wilder adoption of cryptocurrencies especially Steem and SBD!! Airports are really a good starting use case for crypto as we all know how troublesome it is to exchange small amount of foreign currencies just to have a quick meal or buy a drink in a transit airport.

## Go Crypto!! Go Steem!! and... we are coming, Brisbane!!
