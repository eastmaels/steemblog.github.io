<h2><strong>Let me tell you a future story about Steem first ...&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><em>At bedtime, sitting beside my 7 years old son on his little cosy bed ...&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Son</strong>: Daddy! Thank you for teaching me how to Steemit today! That was really cool!</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: You are welcome buddy! I should have done this years ago! I am glad you like it!</p>
<p><strong>Son</strong>: Yeah, totally ... but, you know, I did my introductory post this afternoon but its potential payout has only $3 so far. I don't think it is really impressive, how come? people don't like me? you think?</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: Son, of course not!! let me share a famous Steemit story with you. Long time ago, when all of this had just started, there was a guy who was lucky and quick enough to register the same account name with the platform, yes, his name is exactly @steemit. This @steemit guy is like Bill Gates [<em><strong>Son</strong></em><em>: who? </em><em><strong>Me</strong></em><em>: forget it, anyway, the richest man</em>] in this steem universe. He currently owns like 30% of all exisiting Steems, something close to 100 millions of Steems!! According to current price, 1 Steem is worth 100 dollars. So he is now terribly rich with <em><strong>10</strong></em><em> </em><em><strong>billion dollars</strong></em>!! Anyway, a super rich guy. Do you know how much he earned from his first post!?</p>
<p><strong>Son</strong>: Nope, … like <em>100</em> thousands?</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: No!! No!! Not at all!! It was <strong>$1.7 only</strong>!! See!? Anyone can do that! <em>You</em> are doing better than he was!! So, who knows, you <em>might be </em>the richest guy in Steem universe in the future!! [<em>Son quickly steeming on ipad ...</em>]&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Son</strong>: Daddy!! That’s the <em>company account</em>!!</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: Oh well,... See!? You have done better than the founding company! Time to sleep, time to sleep! little guy! Steem, oh, sweet dreams!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The post said briefly ...&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>Steemit is a social media platform where anyone can earn STEEM points by posting. The more people who like a post, the more STEEM the poster earns. Anyone can sell their STEEM for cash or vest it to boost their voting power.&nbsp;</blockquote>
