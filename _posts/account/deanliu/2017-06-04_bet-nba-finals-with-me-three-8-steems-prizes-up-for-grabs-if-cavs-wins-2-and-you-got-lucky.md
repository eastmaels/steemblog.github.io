<h3>NBA Finals Are Hot!!</h3>
<p>If you are a <a href="http://www.nba.com/news">NBA</a> fan, there is nothing I can tell you... If you are not, simply check #nba tag and you can see a lot of posts - contest, predictions, commentaries, news ... I have nothing to add. I have been an NBA fan for like 20 years, but on and off until recently that Warriors, especially Stephen Curry, re-ignites my passion to watch ... But guess what!? I am not betting on Warriors to win! LOL</p>
<p>https://steemitimages.com/DQmWmEUcbgMCJ3BsqnmWH8eRkr6n87wDejCvKb8tFsTKkhS/LeBron-Durant.jpg</p>
<p>So I support Golden State Warriors, not Cleveland Cavaliers ... But supporting is one thing, and betting is another. It all depends on the odds.</p>
<h3>My Bet - Cavs to Win &nbsp;</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.sportslottery.com.tw/en/home">Taiwan Sports Lottery</a> is the only legal gambling business in Taiwan (well, needless to say, the underground market is much bigger ...) and its odds are mostly slightly inferior to international bookies. But I only bet for fun, it is still a good choice for me.</p>
<p>I missed the first final (betting and live watching) but this time I won't miss #2. So I think, why not drag the Steem community to have fun with me?</p>
<p>First, I decided to go with the Cavs. Simply because ... Its Odds is Good!! <strong>3.3</strong> for Cavs to win this away game!! Despite that I support Warriors, I have great respect for LeBron James and his teammates. I don't think Game 1 is that bad for Cavs. Gosh I can still remember the 2016 Finals... A superb team as well. There is no way to write them off for a price like 3.3!! So go for this option!! See my lottery under.</p>

<h3>Invite you to join the fun - Game Rules</h3>
<p>As you can see that I bought <strong>NT300</strong> for Cavs to win. It is about <strong>$10 USD</strong>. So if I win, I will have a $10*(3.3-1) = <strong>$23 USD</strong> net profit and I would like to share all with anyone who join my little game!! :) Here are the rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Prizes</strong>: Three "<strong>8 Steems</strong>" prizes for anyone who participate successfully. If, most likely the participants are more than 3, then I will run a random process to draw <strong>3 Lucky Winners</strong>!!&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Participation</strong>: No need to upvote the main post. JUST <strong>UPVOTE</strong> THE "Cavs win but Warriors rule" <strong>COMMENT</strong> OF MINE (of course, it doesn't matter if you <em>mean</em> it. lol). Please make sure that you UPVOTE WITH A WEIGHT <strong>MORE THAN 50%</strong>. Of course, you have to do so <strong>BEFORE THE GAME</strong> starts (less than 20 hours) That's it! upvote the comment with more than 50% weight before the game and you are in.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Announcement</strong>: Winners will be announced a few days after the game outcome is out. Only eligible participants will enter the random drawing.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Note</strong>: If Warriors win, then this game is <strong>OFF</strong>. I will lost $10 but luckily with post income to cover it if lucky. But I hope Cavs can win so you get to have a shot at winning prizes. Besides, it will make the final much more exciting. I still believe that Warriors can win the title!! Go! Go! Go! :) &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thank You for Joining and Upvoting!! I WILL increase the number of prizes shall this post goes unreasonably well compensated! :)</strong></p>
<p><strong>GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU!!</strong></p>
