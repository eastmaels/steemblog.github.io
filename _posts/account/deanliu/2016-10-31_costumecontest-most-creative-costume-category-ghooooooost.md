<p><strong>My dad is inspired by the following to design this Halloween costume for me and he had to bribe me with a new Tomica car so I would stand still (soooo hard for me) and pose for pictures ...&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/life/@deanliu/enough-halloween-stuffs-for-me-except-this-one">Enough Halloween Stuffs For Me ... Except This One!</a></p>
<p><strong>Obviously he 'copied' others' ideas ... but he claimed that he would join some costume contest and compete in the CREATIVE category! He was murmuring to me about how observing and copying is part of a creative process ... Well, I get paid (the car) so I will get the job done.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now, please see my 'creative' costume under. I was under the bed sheet okay!? A real and feisty baby boy !</strong></p>
