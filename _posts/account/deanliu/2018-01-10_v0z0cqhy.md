These two candles are amazing stuffs! My wife bought them from a department store and the selling told her that they are made in Taiwan.

They look so very much like real candles but they are not. They are LED light candles. You can charge it simply by plugging the smaller end of USB connector to its little socket by the side (as you can see in the video). The material is so much like wax so users feel they are holding a real candle! You even can smell alike! 

**The amazing part include that the 'flames' are flickering like real ones even though there is absolutely no wind around.** Haha! A fully charged LED candle can last for 5-6 hours if I recall right.

How do you blow it off? No, there isn't any switch at all. **You can just place them upside down and it's off** like you can see my demonstration in the video. Cool, isn't it?

We brought them to the hotel room when we travel. That way, ***you get to enjoy the romantic atmosphere without worrying*** about triggering a fire and die. Ha!

#### Technology is amazing, but it's more so with people's innovative ideas!!

Hope you enjoy it! 

P.S. I have no idea where to buy them. There is no brand or label.
