Anyone who visits Steemit.com will see this trending page in the past three weeks. It's a bad signal for the outsiders.

Post age (7 days) has already passed and there is no sign says 'pinned'. It would look like Steem is dead.

From the 5th on, things seem normal and rolling... 

Someone should do something about it.
