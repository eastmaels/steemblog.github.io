People say that this **Kourakuen** restaurant is one of the must-eat ramen store in Japan. We only found out out this after we went. To us, this was just a restaurant that looked good and suitable for kids for a Sunday family lunch. We love it. 

This is their Roppongi branch.

Many tables inside. It isn't usually so for many Japanese restaurants since many of their customers come in to eat alone.

We were surprised to see many older people. It wasn't a common scene here. Good to had them with us... :)

Noodles, ramens, dumplings....

Iced water - drink as much as you want.

This one looks bland but actually kind of salty... BUT! It's delicious no doubt! I love it!

Fried dumplings and rice. I must say that I don't enjoy Japanese dumplings no matter how expensive they are. Should be just a taste issue. But... this time, I think I had the best Japanese fried dumplings!! Although the best here cannot compare the best in Taipei at all, it still means something! So, I am glad that we ordered this! ^^

This ramen was also good but I forgot its name... >_<....  So, in general, we highly recommend this restaurant given its prices are very reasonable too!

Asahi as always. Beer is cheap here and good quality!

They also have some frozen noodle packs for sale too!

*this **Dean's Tokyo Snapshots** series ( #dean-tokyo as a specific tag) is my photographic diary for my family trip to Tokyo. Due to busy schedule and a naughty boy with us, I won't be able to write much but I will make sure that every photo that I choose means something, at least to me... I hope you enjoy this photo series as well as me! Feel free to comment but I probably won't have much time making replies often. Apologies first. :p*

***follow me @deanliu if you haven't! or not, if this does not interest you...^^***
