Stellar tops the list and Steem comes at second. NEO, Dash and Decred(*well, I never heard of this one!*) follows.

According to this source - [New Crowd-Sourced Ratings Agency Ranks Stellar as Top Crypto
](https://www.icoexaminer.com/ico-news/new-crowd-sourced-ratings-agency-ranks-stellar-as-top-crypto/), this rating agency, **Rency**, is "*a new Californian start up which assesses cryptos on a scale ranging from A (“Excellent”) to E (“Poor”), using a combination of criteria that incorporates speed, transactions fees, team, network, community, governance and adoption*"

Somewhat controversially, Bitcoin only ranks 22th. But maybe what matters more is the scores from each category rather than the overall rating. So you may take a look at individual rating scores for each cryptocurrencies on their website:

Anyway, more exposure is always better for Steem!
