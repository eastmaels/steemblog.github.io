<p>This is not an extraordinary photo nor one with intriguing stories... Rather, this is just for my own record. It is just a moment for me to remember. Yeah. I am the father and that's my son. Taken on 5th of Dec 2015 in Taipei Expo Park.&nbsp;</p>

<p>說是要記錄我自己的父子照片，也對。但主要是分享給cn區朋友，或許你覺得眼熟... 我自己今天整理照片，無意間看到，突然意識到似乎很像... well, you know who... :D ... 去年底在台北花博公園拍的，那時還不識各位好友們啊....&nbsp;</p>
<p>p.s. 順道update一下, 原本說本周要推出點東西, 但可能會暫緩一下(諸多原因),&nbsp;還好有 @lalala 出來要推動些事情，需要資源幫忙的話請隨時召喚我啊...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note. After submission, I found that this is <strong>my 500th post</strong>! Although <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@deanliu/number-of-posts-shown-on-users-page-should-be-re-considered">as I said before that this number refers to both posts and replies/comments</a> and the later usually is several times the former... Well, what the heck, <strong>500 looks good!</strong> So I post this historical moment here as well to share with you ... :P</p>
