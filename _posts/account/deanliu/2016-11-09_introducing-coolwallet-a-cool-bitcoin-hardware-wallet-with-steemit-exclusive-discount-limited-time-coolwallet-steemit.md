<p>Hello to all Steemians! This is the cofounder and CEO of <strong>CoolBitX</strong>, Michael Ou (see photo below… yeah, that’s me holding our CoolWallet and the Steemit sign in a Starbucks). I am very excited to have such an opportunity to introduce to you our innovative bitcoin hardware wallet - <strong>CoolWallet</strong> - through @deanliu ‘s post. Dean and I have known each other since two month ago. I introduced what we do to him and he explained how Steem and Steemit work to me. At the end we came up with the idea of this post. Dean only asked me to authorize him to use the images and texts from our website and to offer exclusive discounts for Steemit users, and specifically he asked me not to return this favor with any money or free wallets. So I agreed to all his requests and let him handle the post by himself. Since I was pretty occupied during October (preparing for money 20/20 in Vegas) and so was Dean, we decided to submit the post until now.<br>
Furthermore, let me say something about our wallet and our future plans. <strong>Security of digital assets</strong> has been and will continue to be top priority as digital economy grows. It has been and always will be the core value of CoolBitx. Its importance was manifested by the the well-known Bitfinex hack a while ago. We strongly suggest to store your bitcoins in hardware wallet rather than your account on exchange sites which are honey pots for hackers. At least, you can get to know what hardware wallets are from this post, so you can have a safer option in the future. As you will see shortly that CoolWallets are not only safe but also convenient and more. And we aims to do better - our next mission is to build a semi-decentralised exchange that has a fast order matching engine like major exchange sites do, but users’ bitcoins are sent from sellers’ CoolWallet to buyer’s CoolWallet. There will be no centralized wallet to hack. Please subscribe to our news letter on our site to follow our latest development.<br>
Finally, <em>it is truly meaningful for a blockchain-based Bitcoin </em><em><strong>CoolWallet</strong></em><em> to support fellow blockchain-based pioneering social media platform </em><em><strong>Steemit</strong></em>, I hereby offer all Steemians the most favorable discount price for purchasing our CoolWallet. Please scroll down to the last part of the post to utilize this <em>limited</em> time offer! I hope you enjoy our CoolWallet and l look forward to introducing more CoolBitx products or services in the future.</p>

<p>Dear all, as Michael has explained the purpose of this post, I will only add a few remarks here. <em>First</em>, the reason for me to ask him not to give me any rewards is because I want to see if we can create a win-win-win situation - Michael can sell more wallets without paying for advertisement, Steemians get what they want at lower prices and I might earn something from this post payout. <em>Secondly</em>, this post is NOT Coolbitx’ own official promotion but an authorized introduction by me. That means me as an four month young cryptocurrency enthusiast won’t give you anything near a professional product review (it is a miracle that I learn how to buy and transact bitcoins online already!). I don’t even know what a hardware wallet is before meeting Michael. <em>Thirdly</em>, a hidden wish behind this post is that I hope by doing this, the global blockchain community can discover more possibilities to collaborate with many leading hardware manufacturers here in Taiwan - just like what CoolWallet has nicely demonstrated. <em>Lastly</em>, the following parts are: brief introduction to CoolWallet by me, some media coverage of CoolWallet, a brief comment by Michael, and last … the <strong>EXCLUSIVE</strong> coupon code for Steemit!&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>A speacial note to the cn community</em></p>
<p>cn區的朋友們好，這次發帖主要是推薦我不久前認識的朋友－歐仕邁(Michael Ou)，CoolBitx科技共同創辦人，他們公司所生產的比特幣硬體（硬件）錢包CoolWallet。在一次偶然機會中我跟Michael認識聊天時談到這個平台，所以才有這次的發帖與限時獨家優惠。要說明的是我僅止於接受該公司的授權使用圖像與文字，沒有接受任何金錢委託，想試試Steemit平台創造三贏的機會。抱歉，由於不希望版面過於雜亂，且其實CoolWallet的頁面是有中文的，所以下面只在最後面的Steemit特別優惠那段再補充中文說明，希望有興趣的朋友多多支持台灣生產的、與加密貨幣相關難得的實體產品！Michael也請我特別跟大陸朋友們（或可說是cn區朋友們）問候，他說他曾經到大陸去演講，印象深刻，相信以這樣的熱度，一定會有很多人有安全的錢包的需求，未來他們會持續以此錢包為基礎，強化安全與方便兩大主軸，再請持續關注與支持囉！謝謝！</p>

<p>Okay. Here comes the unprofessional introduction :). I am a cautious person. Since I have granted the permission to use their official content so I will just follow <a href="https://coolbitx.com/coolwallet/">the official page of CoolWallet</a> to give you a brief impression about this really cool wallet.</p>
<p>If you don’t like nagging, just remember this...CoolWallet is “<em><strong>The most convenient Bitcoin hardware wallet</strong></em>”. As far as I know, the hardware wallet is the most <strong>secure</strong> way to protect your bitcoins. But as normal people, we need to engage in a lot of economic activities, and as bitcoin believers we expect a growing proportion of these transactions to incorporate bitcoin payments. So, <strong>convenience</strong> then is second to security in my opinion. As a hardware wallet, it means <strong>CoolWallet</strong> is not only safe but also trouble saving. What else can you ask for?</p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/10/06/intro0588f2.png</p>
<p><strong>Safety first</strong>. CoolWallet is <em>hack-proof</em>, <em>theft-proof</em> and even <em>waterproof</em>! Look at its logo, a shield, and it manifests their top emphasis for this product.</p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/10/03/intro17eea8.png</p>
<p>Then <strong>convenience</strong> as in its handy design. Yes, the “wallet” is actually a credit card size <strong>smartcard</strong> so it can easily fits in your real wallet!</p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/10/03/intro2d8037.png</p>
<p>Then <strong>convenience</strong> as its easy-to-use. The <em>bluetooth</em> technology enables your <strong>CoolWallet</strong> to communicate with your (mobile) devices effortlessly.</p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/10/03/intro358809.png</p>
<p>An element of <em>theft-proof</em> is to alarm you when your <strong>CoolWallet</strong> and your phone are certain distance apart. Beware! <em>Dog</em> inside!</p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/10/03/intro441268.png</p>
<p>Finally, the ultimate <strong>convenience</strong> - your CoolWallet works on <em>all</em> your devices!</p>

<p>Michael has done his homework on Steemit as well and he personally provides his comment on the only and also the first Steemit post that had mentioned CoolWallet briefly but mainly focused on KeepKey. The post was created by a senior Steemian @tuck-fheman and the link is here:</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/security/@tuck-fheman/keepkey-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-review-protect-your-investment">KeepKey Bitcoin Hardware Wallet Review - Protect Your Investment!</a></p>
<p>And, while appreciating what KeepKey has accomplished, Michael wish to provide you with another option (with <em>discount</em>!). I just quote his remarks here.</p>
<blockquote>Here is my comment on the key difference between KeepKey and CoolWallet: <strong>CoolWallet</strong> is designed to be <em><strong>convenient</strong></em><em> and </em><em><strong>secure</strong></em>. KeepKey is leaning to secure only. KeepKey only works on laptops, which means users have to carry laptop and a bulky wallet (KeepKey) to make a transaction. CoolWallet works on both Android and iOS, and the card-like device fits right in users’ wallet, which makes it the most convenient Bitcoin hardware wallet on the go.</blockquote>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/10/03/p673edf.png</p>
<p>Here comes the most important part! <strong>Exclusive discount</strong> for all Steemians! As Michael puts it“... <em>a blockchain-based Bitcoin CoolWallet to support fellow blockchain-based social media platform Steemit</em>” Therefore, he will offer all Steemians “the most favorable discount price for purchasing the CoolWallet” - a <strong>$30</strong> <strong>discount</strong>, <em>more than 25% off </em>the original price! Prior to this, the company had only offered discounts to the maximum of $10! You can need to find the coupon code revealed in the following photo, enter the code and click ‘Apply’, determine the quantities and destination, and then you can enjoy this great offer! <em>No quantity limits</em>, buy as many as you want. You can also share the code with your friends but please do tell him about Steemit as this platform is the key to make this offer possible! The only limitation is that this offer is only valid within <strong>7 days</strong> after the submission of this post. So you need to act quickly but still the time is sufficient for you to make an informed decision. Sorry we have to set a time limit, or this offer won’t be ‘exclusive’ enough! To be precise, the offer will expire by<em><strong> 12pm midnight of 16th Nov</strong></em>. in Taiwan (UTC+8/GMT+8).&nbsp;</p>
<p>此次對於Steemit提供限時7天（以發帖時間為起點；因此，<strong>兩岸時間（UTC+8 / GMT+8）的11月16日午夜12點</strong>將會結束活動）的<strong>$30美元</strong>的獨家優惠！此前該公司提供過的優惠最多僅有10美元，機會非常難得！優惠代碼（coupon code）請詳見下圖中，不區分大小寫。時間到後，優惠將會截止。由於Michael希望提供給Steemit獨家的優惠，因此需要限定一定的時間。當然你可以把優惠碼告訴朋友，但是由於這個優惠是來自於對Steemit的支持，希望你也順道介紹這個平台給你的朋友。再請把握時間，謝謝！</p>

<p>Okay! Lastly, I sincerely hope that you enjoy my unprofessional introduction and hope that every Steemians who need hardware wallet and do purchase CoolWallet can enjoy this benefit brought to you by <strong>the power of Steem </strong>as well as <strong>the safety, convenience and stylishness brought to you by Coolbitx’ CoolWallet</strong>!!</p>
