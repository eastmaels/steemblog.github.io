I read a story in Chinese about Jeremy Lin today - he is in Taiwan now for his Asia trip. Did not see any version in English news so far and I think this is a great piece of story from which you get to see the honest voices of this outstanding Asian NBA player - maybe not outstanding in terms of skills, but definitely outstanding in terms of personality and role model!

I think this is very good for teaching your kids how to cope with adversities in life, especially for Asian families. So I try to translate it in the following and share with you!

> Yesterday, Jeremy Lin went to Hsin-dian church in Taipei to conduct an evangelistic meeting and talked about the long wait in the NBA free agent market. He once had an emotional breakdown. He said that although he has been trying to achieve his dreams in the right way, it was getting more difficult to do so year by year. He even once felt that he was abandoned by the NBA.

> Jeremy Lin started the Asian trip with the NBA championship this year, but after joining the Raptors, many adversities happened to him - most of the time sitting on the bench, sarcastic comments after the Raptor championship, and even the sense of uncertainty about his future after entering the free agent market, let Jeremy Lin to an emotional breakdown during the evangelistic meeting.

> Jeremy Lin said that after joining the Raptors, he had 12 to 15 games to decide whether his addition would be a success or a failure in the team, but in these games his shooting percentage reached a career low, and he missed three-pointers 17 times in a row and then he barely played in the playoffs. Although he once convinced himself to accept this championship with pride and he had to be strong and confident, the next wait in the free agent market became the last straw to crush him.

> Jeremy Lin said: "Life is really difficult. I always want to do things the right way, but every year the challenges are getting harder and harder, because there is a saying that when you fall to the bottom, you only climb up, but For me, the bottoms were getting deeper and deeper. The free agent market is a very difficult process for me, because I feel that the NBA seems to give up on me. I always think that when there is any chance others can doubt me, they will."

> Jeremy Lin said, "I started the Asian trip after the end of the playoffs. But I really don't want to come because I have to face everyone with smiles every day for six weeks. I need to share with you about my championship, but actually I don't feel that I deserve it. I need to share with you a future that I don't know if I want it. I really feel embarrassed."

> Facing series of challenges from NBA, Jeremy bluntly said that if in the future, he would not want his children to enter NBA. "Because you don't need to face these, you don't have to see the frustration and shame in your life. So I am really keen to ask God:  why do you give it all, give me all this, but let me live in such a difficult situation right now."

> Still, in the end, he proposed three convictions that help him through the hardships, they are, not giving up, not compromising and not losing hope. "Today I come to you, my heart is broken. I may never be able to become the kind of player I want to be. But I can still have freedom. When you know who you are, it doesn't matter who you are not. The Bible says that God will never give up on you."

中文區朋友們，運動迷們，人生迷途者們，這一篇關於運動的報導，其實更多是關於人生困境。為什麼我們支持林書豪？不只是因為他是傑出代表亞裔的NBA運動員，主要還是他那個充滿信念與正向的人生觀，非常適合做為青少年的典範教育！

此刻他在台北，是他亞洲巡迴的第一站。昨天他在台北新店教會的佈道會，說出許多心底話，令人動容，值得一看，所以我才翻譯成為英文版，因為英文新聞都沒見到。

中文可以直接看上面連結，但方便大家閱讀，我也直接複製到下面囉~~~~~

> 「豪小子」林書豪今天晚間前往新店教會進行佈道會，並暢談在自由市場漫長等待的心情，他也一度情緒崩潰地表示，雖然自己一直都用正確的方式在努力達成夢想，但每一年被期盼卻每一年過得更艱難，甚至覺得自己像是被NBA放棄了，一度淚灑會場。

> 林書豪今年帶著總冠軍展開亞洲行，不過對於加盟暴龍後一度枯坐冷板凳，甚至在奪冠後面對外界的冷言冷語，甚至在投入自由市場後仍無法確定下一步在何方，也讓林書豪在今天晚上的佈道會中情緒潰堤。

> 林書豪指出，在加入暴龍後自己有12到15場的比賽可以決定他在球隊將會是成功還是失敗，但在這幾場比賽中他的命中率卻創下生涯新低，還一度連續17次三分球出手未命中，到了季後賽還面臨了無法上場的狀況，雖然在拿下總冠軍後他一度說服自己接受這樣的狀況，且必須要再站起來，不過接下來在自由市場的等待卻成為壓垮他的最後一根稻草。

> 林書豪說：「人生真的好難，我總是希望做事做正確的方式，但每一年挑戰都是愈來愈艱難，因為有一句話說當你跌到谷底的時候你只有往上爬，但對我來講每年的谷底是愈來愈深，自由球員的市場對我來講是非常艱難的過程，因為有點感覺NBA好像放棄我，我一直都認為當有任何機會別人可以懷疑我時，他們就會懷疑我。」

> 對於在下一步仍未確定的情況下就展開亞洲行，林書豪直言自己一度相當抗拒，「在這個季後賽結束之後我就要展開亞洲的旅程，說真的我真的很不想來，因為在這六周的時間我每天都必須要帶著微笑面對大家，我要來跟大家分享一個總冠軍，但我不覺得自己配得上，我要來跟大家分享一個不知道是不是我想要的未來，說真的我覺得滿丟臉的。」

> 進入NBA接連的考驗，也讓林書豪直言如果未來有孩子會不希望他進入NBA，「因為這樣你就不需要面對這些的名聲，不用讓人看見你生命中的挫敗與羞愧，但我最深的問題就是想問神，你為什麼要給這一切，給我這一切，卻又讓我活在這麼艱難的狀況裡面。」

> 不過最後他也提出三個幫助他度過艱難的信念，分別為不放棄、不妥協、不要失去盼望，「今天來到你們面前，我的心是碎的。我可能永遠沒辦法成為我想成為的球員，但我仍可以擁有自由。當你知道你是誰，你不是誰就不重要。聖經上說，神永不放棄你，因為神使萬事互相效力叫愛神的人得益處，那等候耶和華的必要重新得力。」
