<p>Here I am again to share smoothie recipe, BUT most important of all, what I want to share is actually a SUPER useful ingredient that goes with almost any flavour!</p>
<p>Last time, I share a DURIAN smoothie and the post marks my most successful article so far:</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/smoothie/@deanliu/share-my-recent-secret-smoothie-recipe-very-simple-super-good-but"><strong>the DuBaNa smoothie</strong></a></p>
<p>So, this follow up post is kind of an experiment to see if this kind of subject is really popular here. But of course, at the same time, I do love this ingredient that I use it all the time.</p>
<p>Let's get to the point. My favorite ingredient for smoothies.... is....&nbsp;</p>
<p>the PASSION FRUIT!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love it so much that I usually scoop out the pulp from dozens of the fruits and put it into ice trays and make lots and lots of PASSION CUBES! Yeah, keep them in the freezer and they will be handy when you want instant smoothies!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passion fruits have a magical flavor that eating it is like eating one hundred kind of fruits (actually its name in Chinese is exactly the fruit with one hundred flavors!). So it can easily match with other fruits to make great smoothies and juices. Unlike durians being dominant, passion fruits are like the concentration of an orchard that grows so many different kinds of fruits... beautiful, isn't it?</p>
<p>OK. Then I will share a similar recipe using this ingredient. Banana is used as a base fruit of it, and the passion fruit marks its main theme:</p>

<p>Recipe for the <strong>PaBaNa smoothie</strong> (for 1 person) -</p>
<p>- 1-1.5 banana<br>
- one spoonful (maybe 1/4 portion of the above banana) of passion fruit pulp or some PASSION CUBES<br>
- some ice cubes<br>
- iced milk</p>
<p>then put it all into a blender and blend it. There you go! you got yourself a tropical and healthy smoothie!&nbsp;</p>
