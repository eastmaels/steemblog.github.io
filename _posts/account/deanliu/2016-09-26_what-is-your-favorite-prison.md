<p><strong>Me and my 4-year-old son were having a little fun over dinner yesterday night. As he is quite into learning English at the moment, I tried to have some conversation with him. So I started asking...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dad: What is your favorite color?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Son: Black!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dad: Ok. What is your favorite food?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Son: Grapes! </strong><em>(with BIG smiles!)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dad: Who is your favorite person?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Son: Emily! </strong><em>(a cute girl in his kindergarten class, sitting next to him!)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dad: Hmm...&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Son: Me ask Me ask! ... What is your favorite color?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dad: Blue of course!</strong><em> (Steemit BLUE! Yeah!!)</em></p>
<p><strong>Son: What is your favorite </strong><code><strong>PRISON</strong></code><strong>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dad: What!? Prison? Are you sure? Who taught you that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Son: Yes. Prison. What is your favorite </strong><code><strong>PRISON</strong></code><strong>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dad: It's not like I had been to one. But perhaps Tu-Chen prison </strong><em>(as it is the first prison to imprison a former President of Taiwan. It might be good if I really have to choose) (of course, he did not respond to my reply...so I kept asking ...)&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dad: Then. What is YOUR favorite prison then?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Son: </strong><code><strong>THOMAS</strong></code><strong>!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dad: What!? Is it an American prison? Oh... I see, it is 'present' you are talking about! </strong><em>(But Thomas the engine train is from UK - Dad noted)</em></p>
<p><strong>Son: Yes! Thomas the friends! Yes! </strong><em>(Got off from table and went for his Thomas trains... )</em></p>
<p><strong>Thanks for watching!&nbsp;</strong></p>
