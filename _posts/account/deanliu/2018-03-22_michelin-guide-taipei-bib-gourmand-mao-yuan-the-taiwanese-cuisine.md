2018 marks the first time in history that the globally renowned Michelin Guide finally sets its foot in Taiwan and the city they have chosen as a start is of course the capital city Taipei.

When in early March they finally revealed the list, it was of course the headlines for major news channels. A little before that star-level restaurants were disclosed, Michelin Guide warmed up by releasing its **Bib Gourmand list** for Taipei. Well, this is not as serious as the former, but who cares!! It's all ***Michelin recommended***!!

**Mao Yuan (茂園)** is among the Bib Gourmand list. Let me quote from [Michelin Guide's website](https://guide.michelin.com/tw/en/taipei/mao-yuan/restaurant):

>Service is friendly and attentive at this home-style joint which has been serving the neighbourhood with old-time local delicacies since 1971. Most diners pick the catch of the day at the seafood stand; otherwise, a chalkboard menu next to it lists all their signature dishes, such as baby oysters with garlic and steamed seasonal fish with preserved winter melon. Portion sizes can be adjusted according to the number in your party.

Lucky for us, we had been the Mao Yuan two weeks before this news was released and that was actually also our first time visiting this restaurant! I am not good at describing how dishes taste by words, so I can only show your the photo and let you know what that is. Well, *bon appetite*!!^_^

Come in please. This is the new extension to the nearby main store so this one is smaller. Looks cosy.

Look around. The interior design is pretty neat and modern. They hang some pictures/photos of old buildings or fresh new materials in the wall.

米其林到台北，是2018年台灣的大新聞。他們先是公布了一批所謂的**必比登推介**暖身，之後才公布了星級餐廳指南。但反正消費者就認米其林嘛，都是差不多的啦！[台北茂園餐廳](https://guide.michelin.com/tw/taipei/mao-yuan/restaurant)就是在這第一批的推介名單內。

幸運的是，我們第一次到茂園吃飯，就在新聞見報前兩週，所以，儘管本來就蠻熱門的，但還是訂的到位子。上面各位就可以看到，我們點了炒蛤蜊、蒜泥鮮蚵、炒水蓮以及.... 最值得期待的超有名**白斬雞**！！有多好吃我沒辦法文字形容了，真的是不錯喔！但可惜，現在各位要去，不知道是有多困難了吧，或許過一陣子就會退燒。我還有很多菜想嚐嚐呢！

不過，夠幸運了，不抱怨！美食還多著呢！等我下次繼續介紹囉！^_^
