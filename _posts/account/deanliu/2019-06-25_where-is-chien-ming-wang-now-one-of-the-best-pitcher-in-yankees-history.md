Who is Chien-Ming WANG? Well, if you are asking this question, I suggest you stop reading right now. :)

If you watched Major League Baseball during 2006-2012, you definitely will know this guy. What have he accomplished? Let me list a few for you:

* He won 19 games two seasons in a row, and was runner-up for the American League Cy Young Award in 2006
* Possessing a deadly sinker that was described as heavy as a bowling ball
* Starting on Opening Day for the Yangkees at home against the Toronto Blue Jays in 2008
* One of the New York Yankees' 25 Greatest Pitchers in Team History
* In 2007, Wang was honored “Time 100” by Time Magazine for his achievements
* Dubbed “the pride of Taiwan” and one of the most popular public figure in the island's history
....

It was heart-breaking to see him going through so many unfortunate injuries, but it was the same adversities that let us witness how he possesses a strong will to fight and persevere, which, IMO, is more important than his amazing stats in MLB for him to receive such an overwhelming popularity in Taiwan.

Well, anyway. You feel free to Google his name for his glorious and miserable past. But for CMW fans not living in Taiwan, have you been wondering how he is doing after he returned to Taiwan?

Here is my update for you:

Yeah, he is still on the baseball field. Only this time, Chien-Ming WANG becomes a coach! In 2018, one of Taiwan's CPBL team, the Fubon Guardians, announced that the former New York Yankees ace Wang Chien-Ming would join the Guardians farm team as guest coach. The above photo was taken two weeks ago when CMW was invited for the ceremonial first pitch in a CPBL game.

He looked very healthy and happy and I am glad for him that he can still stay on the field that he loves and enjoys every bit of baseball, no matter where it happens, with whoever teammates, whether being a player, a coach or even just a fan!!

 **That is the baseball we all love, isn't it!?**

I won't tell you that on that day, that ceremonial first pitch, expected to be a somewhat still heavy sinker, turned out to be a <sub>ball in dirt</sub>. LOL~~~~ Maybe the Cy runner-up got too relaxed!!

# WANG 40, Forever.
