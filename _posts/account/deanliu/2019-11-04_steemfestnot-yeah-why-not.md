Okay, so you are all going to SteemFest in two days, **sawadee krub**!

Okay, so you write all about _why_ you wanna go, _who_ you wanna meet, _how_ you're gonna save up for it, _what_ you're gonna do ... at SteemFest. Day by day, by day ...

Like that's not enough. Just right before your departure, you seemed to be pretty convinced that everyone would want to know _how_ excited you are, _what_ have you packed for this trip, and _gee_! you can't wait! **_oh_** .... -_-

I am pretty sure the above does not complete the article types about SteemFest. People going to this fest have a magical ability to find something to write about it. Some of the topics even got sponsored heavily!

I've been to Steemit for more than three years and I have never been to any one of the SFs.

It's not like I wasn't interested. I was. Just there were always reasons not to go.

Too far (something very equivalent to too expensive to fly). Not a good time for me. Steem price is too miserable to keep me pumped...

Actually Bangkok is a good chance for me since I live in Asia and can go there in a 4-hour or so flight.

Still cannot. Because of work.

On the other hand, I am not interested in the program itself anymore. I was crazy about SF1 and I watched its live broadcast for half a day to realize that ... it's not so fun. And after SF2 and SF3, I realized that not much of what's presented there will become true or even become something successful.

The only thing that I think I will be interested in attending one day is a cliche answer: _people_. <sub>(oh, one more thing that can be a good reason is a $10 STEEM, lol)</sub>

But, again, you always have your chance to meet Steemians some day down the road, if, theoretically speaking, Steem will exist forever and you guys are not too old, are you?

Wait a minute, what am I doing here? I am here to propose a brand new concept -

### _SteemFestNot_

yeehaw! hell yeah, why can't we guys who do not go to SF have fun too!? WE CERTAINLY CAN!!!

**Give me some good and funny reasons why NOT going to SteemFest is a good idea! I certainly have plenty of them!!!**

- Hey, we are an internet community and we should stay behind the monitors! ~~I don't want others to know that I am not attractive :~~~~~~
- Only the unemployed and people with low pay jobs can spare THREE working days just for an online meetup... weirdos! and they are so hopeless in life that they continue to stay there for the weekend! losers!!
- Go Bangkok for food, for massages, for night life and hangovers, for cultural trips... don't go there for meeting all kinds of Earth people you never meet before okay?
- $0.15, seriously!?
- Do you know the guy behind this event made a whale that can spray when you send 1 STEEM somewhere? It gives me creeps. Maybe he will make you all spray in Bangkok.... ah....
- ...

Have some to contribute!? come on, share it below.

_We SteemFestNots certainly outnumber them and we can get as creative as we can while they are exhausted by their long flights!_

### _SteemFestNot ...  Go! Go! Go!_
