### A spy sneaked into the house of another druglord. 24 other spies in tux were there. No body have weapons and 25 guys looked like gathering here to have a party. Yeah, the drugs there were not so much, but nothing could keep those professional intelligence workers from having fun and exchange their job info over some alcohol ... The spy returned safely. The spy's job was to get the info of the enemy so he did. Boss wasn't interested because there weren't any things to be looted. A female ninja heard and she decided to pay them a visit and kill those bastards. Oh, man, she was fast. Only 5 minutes she took to arrive and all 24 spies were still there. She mercilessly 5 of them. She wanted to kill all but couldn't, because there is a rule of '5 rounds' - damn it! She thought ... _my attack power is enough to kill all in one strike!!_ She returned with dissatisfaction. She decided to strike again. Due to the limitation, she asked 3 more colleagues of hers to go together. Four ninjas, traveling fast like the wind, arrived again and in a split second wiped out the remaining 19 spies in tux, who were still mourning over their 5 dead coworkers ... Now they can have a party in hell. Four ninja girls returned to base with 600 weapon - they don't care about those, they just enjoy killing... Especially, killing useless men.
