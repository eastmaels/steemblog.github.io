<p>When I saw this cute little market near my hotel in Prague, I thought it might be a marijuana related store and I was right. The <em>leaf</em> just looked so special. :)</p>
<p>I was curious, but never had the <em>courage</em> to step inside the store. Besides, when it was too early in the day, it was not open yet. As a tourist who knows to avoid any trouble during the trip and needs to utilize every minute to enjoy the city, I just took photos of it. I know there are lots of weed lovers here on Steemit. So you can say this post is made for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I returned, I took time to search if selling marijuana is legal or not in Prague or in Czech Republic. To my surprise,<em> it is not legal</em>!! Then what are they selling in that store? Still confused... There are many stores like this one around the city, so I figured that it must be legal and common... Anyone? Look at my photos first... then so quoted article from internet.</p>

<p>Information I found from internet. Very interesting article. Source given below.</p>
<blockquote>While it is possible to smoke cannabis freely outdoors, and thousands regularly do, this activity is illegal. Of course, you <em>can</em> do it, but donâ€™t get caught by police. If you get caught, the police officer will most likely just give you a fine. &nbsp;<br>
Prague does boast a lot of coffeeshops, but they definitely don't sell cannabis, just coffee and muffins. Selling any cannabis product containing over 0.3 % THC is simply illegal.<br>
Czechs do love their cannabis, preferably the homegrown variety, which explains why our use of cannabis is one of the highest in Europe and even in the world. One of the most amazing and positive things about this country is that the vast majority of Czechs who don't really like cannabis have absolutely nothing against people who do.&nbsp;</blockquote>
