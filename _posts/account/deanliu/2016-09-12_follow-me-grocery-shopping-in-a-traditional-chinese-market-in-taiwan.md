<h3>It is a beautiful day at Taipei today - a sunny day after days of rain.&nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>台北美好的週日早晨，今天做什麼事好？</strong></p>

<h3>After I wake up, I see a note on my laptop … My wife has given me a list for grocery shopping and no buying from nearby supermarket but from a traditional market that I need to ride subway for 2 stations. Well, it is a beautiful day and my wife’s order is not to be challenged. Besides, an idea pops up: why not share it on Steemit as an introduction for Taiwan’s local markets! (triggered by @elfkitchen ‘s <a href="https://steemit.com/food/@elfkitchen/i-want-to-take-you-into-the-chinese-supermarket">post one week ago</a>) This idea makes me so positive about my coming chore!! Although my wife sees through my brain and gives me a scornful look..</h3>
<p><strong>朋友們，看中文的讀者對於台灣這種傳統市場應該不陌生，我看亞洲各國，大中華圈的傳統市集，大概是賣的東西略有不同，但是那種氣氛是很類似的！我總覺得儘管似乎被認為是不衛生的、不進步的傳統市場，其實正是我們文化的重要成分，這裡面有非常好的生命力與庶民文化，每每我去過市場後都充滿能量的回家！內容我就不多介紹了，今日採購，總金額約38塊美金，下周聽說台灣有颱風要來，物價已經有點漲了，但今天買起來還是挺划算的感覺！這是離我家20分鐘地鐵交通的台北南邊的一個市場...</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Anyway, I took my dumbphone, wallet and shopping bag and stormed out of the door! After 20 mins, I have arrived this local, traditional, vibrant, hustling and bustling market! Follow me and see it for yourself via my dumbphone camera! &nbsp;</h3>
<h3>People, lots of people, more people... is always what you see first entering a market...&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>But as you blend in, gradually, you see only those beautiful, fresh and delicious nature's gifts on the booths...&nbsp;all kinds of vegetables, peppers, garlics, potatoes,&nbsp;tomatoes...&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Roasted chickens, flowers, fruits, fresh fish, chicken... oh, some pictures of pork butcher booth are <a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/IMG_20160911_0822556e11d.jpg">here</a> and <a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/IMG_20160911_075439-1c29eb.jpg">here</a> (in case someone find them too cruel to watch... ) ... I think these are enough for cooking all kinds of meals today!!</h3>

<h3>If you feel hungry after a bit of shopping and bargaining, there are some treats for your stomach. Even newspapers are here for your casual Sunday read.&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>In the following, these are ALL the grocery in my shopping bag today!! Aren't they just gorgeous!? Total cost should be around $1200 TWDs, roughly $38 USDs. Given the forecast of coming typhoon next week (therefore pushing up prices for veges and fruits), this is quite a harvest!!</h3>

<h3>Sometimes when I feel depressed or unhappy, it is quite effective to cheer you up if you just visit a traditional market. You will feel life and energy there - be it noisy bargaining or greetings, pushing and shoving around, or smells of nature in the air - all may revive your inner power and recharge your depleted battery. This is not possible if you go to modern supermarkets. &nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>下次到台灣，一定要找個上午，很早就到傳統市場去逛逛看看，感受一下在地生活的脈動，當然更可以順便吃點便宜又好吃的早餐啦！</strong></p>
