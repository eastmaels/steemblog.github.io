@drugwars announced a new battle system a few hours ago:

[Battle system: skills and upgrades](https://steemit.com/drugwars/@drugwars/battle-system-skills-and-upgrades)

I am intrigued to check how the new battle system would work so I try to do some simulation on the new simulator link given out in the above post:

https://simulator.drugwars.io/next.html

Surprisingly, I found out there are two new roles in the battle unit list! They are **hobos** and **spies**, which wasn't mentioned in any official posts that I read. Seems not even in the discord unless I missed the discussion.

So, I think maybe it's worth sharing with every DW players.

I gave the two new characters a simulation to find out their battle attributes. It's interesting. Check it out the result of 1 hobo v.s. 1 spy:

and they both end up dead in a different way ... hobo dies no matter how and spy has only 1 point of defense.

So the conclusion is ...

**hobo**: attack 2 / defense 0
**spy**: attack 0 / defense 1

That means a hobo will die after his first attack, no matter who he faces (even a spy with no attack power). Unless of course, he is up against no one at all. Then, a spy can harm nobody (unless it's a hobo that dies on his own) and can barely defend himself (unless match up with another spy then both shall live)

This is all I can get from the new simulator. Couldn't know how much each unit costs though... 

The new battle system seems fun. Look forward to it!
