<p>Yes, but - but only blessed people get to enjoy it... because you must first accept or, even better, enjoy the flavor of DURIAN ... yes! the "<strong>king of fruits</strong>" (that's how most people in Southeast Asia will say and I do agree)... some people cannot accept its strong odor but for us durian lovers, it's the scent of heaven!</p>
<p>So, you got that right - durian is the key ingredient of my recipe. But the good news is that if you only 'accept' its flavor, you still have a chance to enjoy this smoothie because the flavor from banana will dilute durian's strong flavor and the fragrance from both fruits combine perfectly together!</p>

<p>Recipe for the <strong>DuBaNa smoothie </strong>(for 1 person) -</p>
<p>- 1-1.5 banana<br>
- one spoonful (maybe 1/3 portion of the above banana) of durian flesh (adjust according to preference)<br>
- some ice cubes<br>
- iced milk</p>
<p>then put it all into a blender and blend it. Voil√†! there you got yourself an amazing smoothie!&nbsp;</p>
<p>very easy, isn't it?</p>
