<p>When I saw Golos' trending post today, I was intrigued. It's true that <strong>if you are Steemians, you will feel like home on Golos, even if you don't speak Russian!!</strong> Like me. Yeah, I have been posting on and off on Golos with the help from Google translate or Yandex translate and I actually want to use this chance to learn Russian but until now still cannot find time to do so.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the event... <a href="https://golos.io/ru--golos-fest/@golosevents/golos-fest-or-anons-29-07-30-07-gorod-moskva">GolosFest in July</a>!!

Only less than 2 months and it will be held at the <a href="https://www.google.ru/maps/dir/''/radisson+%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%8F%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F+%D0%B2+%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0%B5/@55.750046,37.5096492,12.54z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x46b54bb8cfc219c9:0xa1ae04be94817ca0!2m2!1d37.5668288!2d55.741718"><strong>Radisson Slavyanskaya</strong></a> in Moscow.

<p>Sounds great, right? But... there is a catch, I think... that <strong>you probably have to speak Russian</strong>... I am not sure if they are going to have some activities for English-speaking friends, but you can ask those Steemians that are also active on Golos and speak Russian. Or... there is still some time, learn Russian from today!&nbsp;As a start, let me teach you Russian hello: "привет!" [a simple video lesson<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBI_HHA0z2M"> here</a>] :D</p>
<p><em><strong>ALL THE LIQUID REWARDS WILL BE DONATED TO SUPPORT GOLOSFEST!</strong></em></p>
<p>[to its bitcoin account maybe, if they have no official account on Steem]</p>
