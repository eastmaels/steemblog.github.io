<p><strong>NO! How in the world can you fall asleep with Dan talking about how all these exciting new ideas came to life unprecedented in the history of mankind?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fine. I get it - it's TGIF.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You start to lost focus when the $15,000 story ends at a minute and half.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Let me help you with my 3 secret ways to keep you awake!!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>so you can fully digest the essence of this interview. Okay, see those little buttons at the corner of your youtube player?</strong></p>

<p><strong>From the right to the left. Here comes the first one.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Make it FULLSCREEN - it makes Dan and Ned appear right in front of you, dare you sleep?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What!? You fall asleep even faster!? Okay, okay, no problem. You can still try the second one.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Play it @ 2X SPEED - See how funny they are!? much better right? thank you...</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Still can't finish after 5 mins and you keep laughing without listening? mmmâ€¦ that's a problem. But no worries, my very last secret weapon will definitely work. It is the ULTIMATE...</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>TURN ON CAPTIONS!&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Only this time I will sum it up for you in case you already have too much alcohol in your brain. The whole interview is categorized into four parts with manifesting screenshots in the following. I will make it a little more "relaxing" so you can learn new things with ease and share with your friends when you party tonight (No, no cheap jokes about Steem being translated into </strong><em><strong>being</strong></em><strong>, </strong><em><strong>skin</strong></em><strong>, </strong><em><strong>teen</strong></em><strong> or </strong><em><strong>skiing</strong></em><strong> etc).</strong></p>

<p><strong>"I am a narcissistic capitalist." - Jeff.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2><strong>I guess you are not sleepy no more?!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>But seriouly there are some great TRUE remarks that you should really hear:</strong></p>
<blockquote><strong>Don't give up if you aren't immediately recognized like you were now ... persistence pays - by Dan</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>It's not just a social network ... (but) an online social economy - by Ned</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Their money is the social network of their economy (refering to countries) - by Dan</strong></blockquote>
<p><strong>For other great remarks, WATCH </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W0EYe23or4&amp;feature=youtu.be"><strong>THE VIDEO</strong></a><strong> NOW AND FINISH IT!</strong></p>
<p><em>Disclaimer - most of the post intends to be fun to read and get people to really watch the video. If somehow I have offended anyone in any way due to my insufficient understanding of English or the culture, I blame it all to Youtube captions makers and do another apology post to ... you know... Last, a sincere apology to Dan, Ned and Jeff for any sacrifices you were made here. I hope the laughs are worth it.</em></p>
