I tried partiko's point system the other day and it's fun to redeem and full of possible potentials.

I redeem 614 points for an upvote of $0.022... pretty small amount but since it's almost like free and considering Partiko might (and IMO should) get some delegation from the official team (better than giving delegation to those projects that eventually leave the platform, right!?) or maybe some big whales (*I do not know anything but I am sure the Partiko team should have the intention to make that happen*), who knows? the points might worth more! ^^

If you haven't tried this very handy Steem mobile UI, you should download it and try it now! [Here](https://steemit.com/partiko/@partiko/partiko-weekly-report-3--partiko-sponsoring-steemfest-qposbaym) is Partiko's latest weekly report where you can find relevant information.

Personally I do not recommend using it for writing longer posts, but Partiko is very suitable for becoming the *twitter* of Steem. However, my highest expectation is for them to become some kind of Steem Mobile Payment interfact, a dream that might not be too far once the coming Velocity Hardfork HF20 accelerate much wider adoption globally...

Well, before that happens, at least we get convenience and points! ^_^

The following are some screenshots regarding redeeming Partiko points ...
