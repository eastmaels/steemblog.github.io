Since the game has changed the rule again yesterday, we now have quite a different game now. Especially when it comes to battles.

**Information.**

Yes, this is a very simple and easy change, but it has changed the whole game!

Now, you no longer can check every player's army, production and stock level. In other words, information (or, intelligence) is now not free to have. You need to do something to get it (scouting), like sending one Rowdy to fight your target opponents so the battle result will show all the information you need above.

Oh, yeah, the mechanism of Shielding is off now. So it means you can fight someone as frequently as you please but one player can only be attacked once at the same time.

#### What will it bring to the game?

I think battles will be less frequent for now due to more costly information. Since battles under most circumstances are not economically profitable, I assume the intensity of battles will decrease. But, since the shield is off, the sheer number of battles might actually increase! (people keep robbing some unarmed player every 20 minutes... sth like that)

Hence, it means that for now, we can again shift our attention back to production and wait for the next rule change (well, no battles make the game developers unhappy... XD).

#### What else does it mean?
Since information is almost free and open for blockchain applications. How can DrugWars can limit this while maintaining its blockchain dapp game status?

I think because for this part, information about others' status is still ***centralized***. So they do have such power and they exercise it to increase playability of the game. I like this change, but at the same time, there might be some concerns about this information centralization - since the game operator has this ***valuable*** information, how can players trust them to keep it fair for all? For example, they can divulge *some* information to their friends, to someone who pay them under the table without the public's awareness.... Anything that we discussed about the drawbacks of centralization....

Well, I meant *theoretically*. I don't mean to question our beloved developers of DrugWars... Just for discussion. ^_^ 

Now, I need to head back to the game and send my scouts!
