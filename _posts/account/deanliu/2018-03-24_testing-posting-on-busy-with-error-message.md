### "Unknown error has occurred."

yeah, and I cannot post my new story, which I am pretty sure contains no weird characters or whatever as I have previously posted similar posts which are under the same series - **B.L. Diary**. The pictures, formats are all the same, only the texts are different.

This issue is getting serious with my posting via busy. I have been using this platform for a few weeks and it was quite good at first. Only recently did it start to bother me with this **"Unknown error has occurred."** message, which seems to resemble Steemit's "Missing Posting Authority" problems? I don't know. Both are still mysterious to me as I really cannot imagine anything wrong on my side...

So, I went to Steemit and tried. Did not work out either. It's weird. Normally they are backup to each other but today no.

Therefore, I am writing this new and simple post to test if it is still so with my busy posting... If it's the same then bummer what can I do now? If this one is fine, then it means it's the draft for the post that went wrong? But I cannot figure out why at all!!

Please anyone enlighten me, as I cannot find any answers from Google search or Asksteem.

## Update.

I have successfully published [the story](https://busy.org/@deanliu/b-l-diary-07) I mentioned via a method I have used before. Unfortunately, this method, despite it seems to work well, does not answer my question here.

I will share the method first.

This time I use Steemit to submit as it requires frequent editing right after submission and busy, while it's really getting better, has problem with the editing function (my own experience).

So I submit via Steemit with minimal content (one line only or repeated same line for 20 times if you worry about some bots' length evaluation on your post) and finally it works.

But it's not the content I wanted to post, or at least 90% is missing. So what I did is - add piece by piece  (or paragraph by paragraph) to update the post. If something went wrong and you got an error message from updating, then it must be the last new paragraph you added! Check if there is anything wrong there (but to be honest I am still confused what constitutes an illegal text).

My experience this time ... At the end, I added **ALL** my original content to the first short/test version of this post without any error message. So, yeah, WTF. It is the same article after this manoeuvre!! Makes no sense. Although I get the job done.

So, the question still holds. 

**WHY?**
