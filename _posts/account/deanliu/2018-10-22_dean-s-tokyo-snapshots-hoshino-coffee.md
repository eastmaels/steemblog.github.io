My wife told me that this Hoshino Coffee shop is a famous chain cafe and they have some pretty decent meals. So we went there when we were staying at Kinshicho. 

The decoration is very good but since it's Japan we don't want to be impolite and take photos at others... So, most photos were on our food...

We ordered three meal sets and they were all good. This one was especially recommended.

*this **Dean's Tokyo Snapshots** series ( #dean-tokyo as a specific tag) is my photographic diary for my family trip to Tokyo. Due to busy schedule and a naughty boy with us, I won't be able to write much but I will make sure that every photo that I choose means something, at least to me... I hope you enjoy this photo series as well as me! Feel free to comment but I probably won't have much time making replies often. Apologies first. :p*

***follow me @deanliu if you haven't! or not, if this does not interest you...^^***
