<h2>Previously on Steemit #cn... 前情提要...</h2>
<p>Yesterday I posted an experience sharing article (link below) at the #cn community and at the end<strong> promised to give away 30 voters (excluding the rich) $1.00 as a welcome gift to this community</strong>. And with the generosity from @pharesim @abit @laonie and etc... this post reached a first <strong>payout of $54.77 and 69 voters</strong> have voted to keep this post exposed and this activity fun, as well as to give and to receive greetings. I am thrilled so I decided to give <strong>ALL</strong> 69-1 voters (excluding myself) a token of thank you and best wishes. Reading this far, you should have learned that this activity is over, and if you did not participate, better luck next time but<strong> we still wish you the best here</strong>.</p>
<p> 昨天我的經驗分享帖文末承諾了30位相對不富的voters「<strong>希望現在在這裡的cn人都能有一個被祝福的1.00開始</strong>」。結果很高興，最後感謝 @laonie @abit @pharesim 等眾神大力推一把，讓我們遠遠越過cn區的「阿比線」，本帖payout達到$54.77，有69人upvote，讓<strong>1.00活動</strong>能夠熱鬧成功有趣！所以，我決定所有69-1位voters(我除外)都會收到一份感謝的steem。如果你沒能及早參加，下次一定還有好玩的機會，我們也都誠摯祝福你在這裡好好玩，好好地寫作並受到獎勵！ </p>

<h2>How gifts are distributed from 0.01 to 1.00 神秘禮物即將送出</h2>
<p>The $54.77 payout has been paid by the system: &quot;<strong>Author reward of 27.383 SD and 13.316 STEEM POWER</strong>&quot;, making my total SteemDollar to be $46. This is my short-term budget constraint. Next questions – how to distribute? I decided to do it this way – 3 types and 3 corresponding rewards with number of voters bracketed.</p>
<p>此次的SD作者收入為$27.383，計入我個人帳戶後目前約有$46，這是短期我能支付的最高金額。那要如何分配這些禮物金額呢？我決定這樣做：以下是三種身分與三種金額，括弧內是人數。</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Master</strong> (3): again, the contributions from @pharesim @abit @laonie cannot be emphasized more. They are granted the highest honor (in my logic) $0.01 to symbolize their positive role meanwhile receiving as little as possible from the crowd. BTW, @wang is a bot. I love it and will send $0.01 as well.</li>
  <li><strong>大師</strong> (3)：沒錯！就是 @pharesim @abit @laonie 這三位大神同樣會接受我們的最高敬意，我會以$0.01來向他們致敬，彰顯他們正面角色同時代表無私付出。 @wang也在列，但它是bot。</li>
  <li><strong>Jedi</strong> (13+1): from @somebody, @coinbitgold,.. to @miacats, and if you may, me as a curator would like to be called Jedi without reward from myself. These generous users also significantly help this post succeed. A gift of $0.10 will be given to say thank you. As you can see from the voter list, the wealth variance is big within this group. I use myself as a separating point – following the spirit of helping the ones that are poorer than you (only at steemit, I believe many are richer than me in real life). Apology to @xiaohui my first cn friend here for not granting you Jedi (but you get to have $1.00!).</li>
  <li><strong>絕地武士</strong> (13+1)：從 @somebody, @coinbitgold,..到 @miacats 抱歉無法一一列出詳見下圖(我也把自已算上因為名字很酷)，他們的貢獻讓本帖能夠活躍並成功，將致贈$0.10來表示謝意。絕地武士群內差異大，我把自已當作分界點，遵循協助弱者的精神來完成這件事(事實上這裡面很多人可能在現實中都比我富裕吧)。同時向 @xiaohui 說抱歉沒給你絕地武士稱號，但你可以拿他們的10倍工資啊！</li>
  <li><strong>Apprentice</strong> (51): all lucky supposedly new comers. Even if you are not from cn, still welcome. Everybody happy and will get a welcome $1.00 from me and that’s enough for me. Total expenditure will be $52.34 and I will be $7 short. So the last 7 “apprentices” will have to wait until I have new SD income to send you. I promise I won’t forget and will do it soon as this post might bring some cash in as well.</li>
  <li><strong>學徒</strong> (51)：最歡樂的一群！原本30人名單擴增為51人，大家都可以得到$1.00的歡迎禮物。因此，總支出會是$52.34，現金不足，所以最後7位還要等一下，等之後或是這個跟帖讓我有流動性之後，一定馬上送到！</li>
</ul>

<h2>How I did it and How about reward from THIS POST? 計算方式說明及此帖獎勵處理</h2>
<p><em>I really don’t want to be considered ‘abusing the system’ so that’s why I make everything as clear as possible and give away as much as possible. Besides I tried hard to carry ‘value’ in all my posts including this one</em>.  How I generate the ranking? First, click the post and switch to its steemd version by replacing ‘steemit’ with ‘steemd’ in the link. Second, find the ‘vote details (69)’ and click it and you will have most information you need. Third, I use rshares as a proxy for wealth level since I don’t have time to check all 69 users. Then I just apply my rules specified above and calculate it in excel. Viola! Let me know if anything inappropriate.</p>
<p>由於Steemit的運作方式，存在操弄系統獲取利益的空間(尤其是當voters與author之間有支付期約關係時)，所以我盡量讓事情透明化並且盡量讓獎勵分配出去。至於此次的排序怎麼做的也可以分享一下：首先，點進前帖，並且將連結中的steemit改為steemd以到達其背後資料網頁；其次，找到‘vote details (69)’並點入就可以看到大部分資料；再來，我選擇以rshares當作財富的水準(沒有時間查詢69人的資料)，最後把上述規則加入後用excel排序計算。大功告成。如有問題請跟我說。</p>
<p>As to the reward for this post, first I will pay the last 7 apprentices. <strong>All the leftover Steem Dollars (and the 4-week payouts from this one and the previous one if any) will be saved temporarily in my account and used in public benefit for the development of the #cn community should any public projects surface</strong>. All SPs minus the SDs that I give away will be considered my reward for doing this. I hope that’s fair. Thank you for reading this far. <strong>I hope it is amusing as well as encouraging</strong>.</p>
<p>至於本帖的獎勵，我會首先支付最後7位，所有剩下的SD以及這次兩帖的4周SD獎勵(如果有的話)，都會先存著。如果將來cn區有公益project或是任何公益事件，我會記得把這些拿出來。至於過程中我得到的SP，除了補償一些SD損失外，也因為流動性，就當作給我這個curator Jedi的獎勵了(應該也不多才是)。最後謝謝所有人的參與與upvote！事後所有未寄出的1.00可以在reply當中告訴我。除了7位之外，應該今日內都可以收到才對。<strong>Happy Steeming!!</strong></p>
