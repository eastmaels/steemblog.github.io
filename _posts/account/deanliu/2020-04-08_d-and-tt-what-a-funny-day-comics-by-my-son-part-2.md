<h4>

Last time I shared a post of comics created by my son TT. I am glad to know that people find them funny, other than his own daddy ... lol

I showed the post to him and he's super excited and went on to create more comics and asked me if they were funny ... Well, some were not ... you cannot do creative things with a purpose of entertaining others in mind - you need to *want* to entertain yourself first and it will be great!

Well, finally I picked two that seemed okay.

Hope you enjoy them this time too! ^_^

Check it out.
