Soccer is actually not mainstream sports in Taiwan. Baseball being the most popular one, and the second is basketball. Although soccer is slowly getting some traction, it is still far behind those two popular ones...

A minor area in soccer is another story - that is, kids soccer! It is sooooo popular in recent years that everywhere I go during weekends in Taipei, I can see kids with football club uniforms playing on the grass of many parks in the city. Then my son became one of them and we even have TWO classes during weekend!

I think the main reason behind this is that parents in Taiwan now are very active in finding good classes for kids nowadays and in the 'health-enhancing' area, soccer seems to be a great choice - baseball and basketball are not suitable for small kids!

Maybe the landscape for soccer in Taiwan will change after ten years due to this fever in kids soccer! ^^

之前分享過，幼兒足球這幾年在台灣很風行。如果你夠瞭解，台灣最受歡迎的運動其實是棒球跟籃球（有點跟著美國走的感覺）... 足球向來蠻非主流的。雖然慢慢有在變化，但還是遙遙落後前面兩項運動～～

不過，幼兒足球這兩年的發展是大大例外！可能是因為家長現在越來越意識到小朋友的健康問題，都會在課後找其他體育課程來加強兒童健康，而棒球跟籃球根本不適合小孩子玩，能夠在草地上奔跑的足球，因此越來越受歡迎！

假日的國中小操場或公院草地上，總是可以看到各家陸續湧現的足球俱樂部，教練帶著一眾小朋友在踢球練球～～

我想，再過十年，這些小朋友長大，應該會大幅改變台灣足球運動的生態吧！^^
