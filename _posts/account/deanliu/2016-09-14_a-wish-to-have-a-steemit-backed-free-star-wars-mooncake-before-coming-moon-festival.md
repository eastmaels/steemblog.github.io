<h2><strong>Happy Holidays! 中秋節快樂！행복한추석 !!</strong></h2>
<p>Starting from tomorrow is Taiwan's 4-day holiday for the <strong>mid-autumn festival</strong>. Family and friends get together to watch the full moon and eat mooncakes, pomelos... and often hold BBQ party as well. There have been and will be a couple of Mid-Autumn festival or Mooncakes posts recently especially if you check the cn tag, &nbsp;so I won't bother explain what it is or the story with a beautiful lady, a woodman and a rabbit (no, no werewolves ok!?). I just want to make a wish to this amazing community before I enjoy the coming holidays. Here is why...</p>
<p>My wife bought a special mooncake yesterday. I was excited after I saw it and said to her: "let me share this on Steemit and you might be able to get your money back!" Well, needless to say, she gave me another scornful look again (feel familiar!? see <a href="https://steemit.com/life/@deanliu/follow-me-grocery-shopping-in-a-traditional-chinese-market-in-taiwan">here</a>) and left with a couple of laughs. This is understandable as I never withdraw any significant cash from Steem and gave it to her.<strong> This time I hope to impress her so she can be more supportive of my steemit activities</strong> like taking photos when we eat out and staring at laptop for hours without moving...&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Product - Maxim's Star Wars Lava Chocolate Mooncake</h2>
<p>Ok. What is this special mooncake that makes me so excited!? May I present you the <strong>Star Wars Lava Chocolate Mooncake</strong> from Hong Kong's famous Maxim's food company (bought in Taiwan)!! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Let's unpack it and reveal the LAVA!</h2>
<p>Check this out... It's the <strong>Emblem of the Galactic Republic</strong>!! (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Republic">here</a>) Eat it and you are one of us...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cut it open so the chocolate lava erupts! &nbsp;</p>

<p>You can compare it with normal mooncakes... boring package... but, well, taste better!!</p>

<h2>My Full Moon Wish</h2>
<p>The price for this Star Wars Lava Chocolate Mooncake is<strong> </strong><code><strong>TWD$749</strong></code> (<a href="http://www.appledaily.com.tw/appledaily/article/headline/20160905/37368978">source</a>). According to today's TWD/USD exchange rate, it is roughly <code><strong>USD $23.6</strong></code>, which according to current USD/SBD rate is around <code><strong>$27 SBD</strong></code>. If I am going to receive $27 SBD from this post, then its payout has to exceed $27*2/75%=<code><strong>$72</strong></code>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, I am making a wish here: please hear my wish all big whales out there... make this post pass the $72 market so I can get $27 SBD and turn it into BTC, USD, TWD... Then I can show it to my wife and say: see!? By introducing this interesting mooncake, Steemit can generate the value to make this mooncake absolutely FREE!&nbsp;</p>
<h1><code>MY FULL MOON WISH: please help this post pass $72 !&nbsp;</code></h1>
<p><strong>If this wish&nbsp;is to be granted by our dear whales, then I will donate the same amount of SBD from this post into my charity fund for children welfare</strong> (you can check this <a href="https://steemit.com/memo/@deanliu/memo-for-my-own-use-only-recording-saved-sbd-for-public-benefit-also-a-experiment-for-bot-voting-but-they-don-t-know"><strong>memo</strong></a>). But of course I need some time to save up to do that as the $27 SBD will be cashed out to be the evidence of "<strong>Steemit works</strong>!!" in my family courtroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Oh, I include the cn tag and kr tag so friends from these two communities can help this wish come true since we all share this festival together: 中秋節快樂！행복한추석 </strong>(forgive me if google is wrong... :P)<strong>!! Thanks a million for your help!!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This is my son turned into Darth Vader: "<strong>please give my mother a Steemit-ba(c)ked mooncake!!</strong>"</p>

<h2><strong>Happy Moon Festival to Every Steemians Out There!!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> <em>after submission I just found out that my friend @ace108 has posted about this mooncake 2 weeks ago (</em><a href="https://steemit.com/photography/@ace108/introducing-mid-autumn-festival-pics-from-gardens-by-the-bay-by-ace108"><em>here</em></a><em>). Glad he didn't really purchase it but just mentioned it. So there is still a distinction. check it out! @ace108 (you were posting mooncakes 2 weeks ago!?)</em></p>
