<p>Two weeks ago I had a great time making Halloween toys with my kid ...</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/life/@deanliu/happy-halloween-from-my-son-ethan-and-rody-the-horse-and-how-we-had-fun-doing-art">Happy Halloween from my son Ethan and Rody the horse and how we had fun doing 'art'</a></p>
<p>So, I did it again last weekend. This time, I've given it some thoughts and decided to make<strong> a fishing set </strong>for my son. This job requires more delicate works so he cannot really do too much hands on activity with me. But I let him pick colors, pick which fishes to draw and he was happy doing it and also coloring by himself beside me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay, first you have to <strong>get materials and tools ready</strong>. I bought these materials from a stationery store. They cost me <strong>less than NT$200 (under US$7)</strong>. The tools you need are all common office stationery - <em>scissors, stapler, tape, marker pens </em>... Materials include<em> a small flag (only need the rod), multiple color pearl plates (or if you prefer others), cotton thread, small magnets and some paperclips</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Now, everyone is here on the table!!</strong></p>

<p><strong>First, let's make the fishes.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>You can google search the images of the fish or anything you want to make. Add the keyword <strong>'sketch' </strong>to your search might help you find suitable images to copy. Print these images out if it is more convenient for you.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Use the marker pen to trace them on the pearl plates of different colors! I drew four of them: <strong>a whale, an octopus, a tropical fish and a turtle!&nbsp;</strong></li>
  <li>Use tape to stick stapled pins to these cute creations. See the yellow circles in the photo.</li>
</ol>

<p>I wrote down their English names on the back of them so my son can<strong> learn when he plays</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It would be easy if you can buy some fishes and just staple them. But it would be less fun though.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Next, it is time to make the fishing rod!!</strong> (see following photos for each action)</p>
<ol>
  <li>Get all the stuffs you need on the table together.</li>
  <li>Here we have two choices for the <strong>hook</strong>: pins or paperclips, weaker or stronger magnets?</li>
  <li>I decided to use paperclip and the stronger (shiny) magnet. Use tape to adhere the &nbsp;magnet to the &nbsp;clip. You can try your best combination. Stronger magnets are <em>not necessarily</em> better as it might be harder to get the fish <em>off </em>the hook!</li>
  <li>Use cotton thread to connect the rod and the hood you made. Viola!<strong> Your fishing rod is ready!</strong></li>
