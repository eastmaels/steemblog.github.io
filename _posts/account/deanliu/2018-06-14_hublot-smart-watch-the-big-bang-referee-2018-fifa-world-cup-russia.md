## Hunter's comment
Can any football fans resist this incredibly elegant and passionate Hublot Smart Watch designed for 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia? I guess not! With 2018 FIFA World Cup happening within 24 hours, I think this watch speaks for itself ... 

You should "watch" this short 27-sec video first - [click here](https://hublot-a.akamaihd.net/hds/2881164053001/201803/2881164053001_5755567074001_5755566125001.mp4?pubId=2881164053001&videoId=5755566125001)

A few points worth mentioning are summarized below:

* The concept of *watches* might be old, but this is a *smart* watch - technology embedded to make it state-of-the-art product in the 21st century! 
* It *"connects you to every decisive second of the matches being played at the 2018 FIFA World Cup - a much-anticipated innovation that could not have been imagined by any other watch brand"*. Sounds smart right!?
* This is, naturally, a unique edition that is limited to 2018 pieces. Well, I am not sure if anyone can still get one. But even if you can find one, it will certainly be pricey... But we all love to know that such a cool watch for football exists right!? ^_^
* Characteristics - emblematic architecture cut out of the lightness of titanium, bezel decorated with 6 H-shaped screws, Kevlar insert, 49-mm case, thousands of downloadable applications...
* Hold your breath, this Hublot Watch features several notifications - announcing matches 15 minutes before their kick-off, as well as yellow and red cards, player changes and goals; it vibrates and displays the word GOAL instantly every time a goal is scored! How exciting!!!
- I'll leave you to check other details on the product page! 

#### GO GO GO! 2018 FIFA WORLD CUP !!! ^_^
