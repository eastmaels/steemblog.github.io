<p><b>How do I know?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Because I was there this morning when Mr. Tapscott said it and so were Vitalik. They are the distinguished guests (Tapscott gave a speech) in a conference about blockchain today at Taipei and I paid to get to sit in the audience and heard him said so.</b> <br><br>Steemit editor is not working properly so I will share this experience later. Cheers!</p>
<p><b>Can you find Vitalik in this photo? :) </b></p>
