Yesterday I met with Steemian @fr3eze and his wife, who is also on Steem but I am not sure if she is willing to let me reveal.

They came here for a short travel and we arranged this meeting before they came. I took them to the [Le Promenoir Cafe](https://steemit.com/cafe/@deanliu/le-promenoir-cafe) in Taipei, which I had shared on Steem before, and we chatted for almost two hours until I had to leave due to a family matter.

Meeting with Steemians has always been great and unique experience to me for every past meetups with Steemians I had in the past three years ...

Let me check.

The first time should be meeting with @shieha, who is among the first (and very few) Taiwan Steemians like me. 

The most memorable meetup goes to [The first major Taipei Steemit Meetup](https://steemit.com/meetup/@catwomanteresa/the-first-major-taipei-steemit-meetup-steemit) during which I met with a handful of Steemians including @livinguktaiwan in Taiwan and also @sweetsssj who happened to be visiting Taipei at that time. It was really exciting!

I met with a few friends from Hong Kong and Malaysia in Taipei too. Some of them live in Taipei and some just came here to travel. Each time we all had great time chatting Steem and crypto - yeah, some of them own more than one bitcoin, a target that myself has yet to achieve... >_<

Also there were friends from mainland China or Chinese living in Europe ... Basically meeting with Steemian is like meeting a stranger in the first 20 minutes and meeting an old friend after that. So it is really weird, in a good way! Every time it works like this.

Oh, the only time I met with Steemians in Taiwan but outside Taipei was with the French guy @stoodkev who is a great contributor to Steem. We met each other during later meetup in Taipei too.

Meetups outside Taiwan happened twice I think. One time in Beijing with @oflyhigh and one time in Tokyo with 6 or 7 Japanese Steemains. Those experiences were awesome - you went abroad hundreds of miles from home and met with people you had never seen before and felt like old friends talking and made you feel home...  The magic of Steem, something that I will never forget in my life. I wish it can last forever.

See!? I have not yet had the luck to join any SteemFests, but I was blessed with such miraculous experience. I cannot even imagine what will happen if I attend one. I will probably go crazy I guess ...

After brief calculation, it turns out that I have already met with more than 20 Steemians!!! Wow, I cannot believe it. 

Community is not an empty word. I finally realize.

It's not a word for decoration, for selling coins, for earning money or for running any particular business ...

A web of real human beings behind the seemly cold encryption and decryption actions.

That is where the true power of Steem, the blockchain for humans, lies.

So, when you have become a Steemian for some time and made some friends here.

***MEET IT UP! You will be amazed.***
