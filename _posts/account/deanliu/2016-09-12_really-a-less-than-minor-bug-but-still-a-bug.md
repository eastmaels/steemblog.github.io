<p><em>Please, don't bother reading this post as this is really minor.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I have noticed this problem (bug?) for quite some time but it doesn't really affect my steemit activities so I never bother telling anyone. Until recently I tried to bookmark some pages and realized that it does cause some inconvenience. But again, not important as it's too easy to deal with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See page titles in this picture: today's trending page as well as top four pose pages... fantastic jobs, guys!</p>

<p>They won't be the same after you read them... any scrolling down of the page will turn the title into "Post-Steemit"... Now we have four <strong>identical</strong> post page titles (you can get them back if you click 'reply' or reload the page)... That's it. The small tiny bug I mentioned. Not really of any importance... Just not neat enough. For me of course.</p>

<p>It causes some tiny problems too. When you want to bookmark it without noticing this, your bookmark will be slightly different in the title part (red in the following). Not a problem, just reload the page and save the bookmark then. I know. That's why I said less than minor.</p>

<p>I just post it so if anyone could take care of it sometime maybe in split seconds... after all, this less than tiny bug bugs me a little bit... and, by the way, I don't know anything technical or Github.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Happy Steeming, fellow Steemians!&nbsp;</strong></p>
