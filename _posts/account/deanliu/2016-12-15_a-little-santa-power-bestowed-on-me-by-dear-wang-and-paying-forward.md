<p>It is close to the wonderful Christmas time. Many posts have been surrounding this seasonal theme (like @good-karma 's <a href="https://steemit.com/steemadvent/@good-karma/day-14-steem-advent-calendar-2016-win-prize-everyday">Steem Advent Calendar 2016</a>). I have a small magic experience to share with you too!</p>
<p>@wang is a famous user here, or at least used to be famous for welcoming newbie with automatic comment. I received a lot of support from him (I suppose it's a him). For that I was grateful to write a <a href="https://steemit.com/fun/@deanliu/a-dear-wang-letter-how-i-miss-you-and-steemit">Dear Wang Letter</a>. For all these days, he is still with me and upvoting me that I almost forget about his existence. Lately, probably since one week ago, I surprisingly found out that @wang is following me upvoting! There might be some criteria to screen but mostly he follows my voting if he hasn't cast the vote on that post and <em>even to comments</em>! (but smartly reduce to 1%). I have seen this before - he follows @sweetsssj too (following her makes more sense, huh? lol).</p>

<h3><strong>My Little Santa Power</strong></h3>
<p>I was excited because I cannot recall the last time when my vote can <em>make a difference</em> (i.e. bringing $0.00 to $0.01) ... probably when Steem price is high enough with my SP only 2-3k. I love the feeling of making a difference because I have been there and really understand the feeling of seeing a lot of $0.00 popping out again and again (hence I keep proposing to extend payout shown to the 3rd decimal place and glad that busy will adopt this advice, from many).</p>
<p>So, I was given this magical Santa Power (SP) and I am always in the mood of finding deserving posts/comments to increase the number just a little bit (when they have already some amount, my power is larger)! But of course I did not squander it as I might lose it shall wang decide not to follow me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday I decided to make this post to feel a little bit more towards Christmas. So I browsed through new posts after 30 minutes without much payout for a lucky (from my perspective) receiver. I stop at @pilot 's<a href="https://steemit.com/photography/@pilot/fresh-powder-on-mt-hood-today"> snowy mountain post</a></p>

<p>It was a $0.01 and 17 votes post with a perfect theme - where else could Santa be? So I did my work to prepare the screenshots and all. And then ... wave my magic Santa wand and vote! Viola!! I am the 18th voter, see the processing circle?</p>

<p>See how it turned 19 as @wang joined and made it <strong>$0.05</strong>. 5 times magic!! :)</p>

<p>One thing I also noticed along the way is that although @wang 'follows' me but his voting record in steemd always shows like I am following him ... I really don't mind <em>at all</em>! I am just so curious how he pulls it off. Maybe he <em>is </em>Santa on Steemit!? That's just fun to share ...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then I continue to <em>reward </em>the most engaging comment by @ourlifestory and gave out<strong> $0.01</strong> for his passionate comment! :)</p>

<p>Then nothing else I could do except enjoying my false sense of <em>good deeds</em>. Next morning (today) when I checked again and found out that the <strong>real Santas</strong> had come for @pilot ! And $0.05 became <strong>$15 and 90 votes</strong>!!</p>

<p>The real Santas being @berniesanders @nextgencrypto ... including @wang of course, I can't even see my name up there... <em>What a big group of Steemit Santas</em>!! <em><strong>Hoooo Hoooo Hoooo </strong></em><strong>!!</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh, of course, that means me and @wang both received good curation income (3 and 0.3 SP respectively).&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>You still have a few hours left to enter this trail of Santas! Check @pilot 's beautiful snow photos! <strong>Hear the jingle bells?</strong></p>

<h3>Pay It Forward to Busy</h3>
<p>Receiving income from this post feels a little bit weird if you don't somehow <strong>PAY IT FORWARD</strong>!! As I am craving for @busy.org 's <a href="https://steemit.com/busy/@busy.org/busy-donation-terms-introducing-our-donation-levels"><strong>Busy Donor Badge</strong></a> and I really support what they are doing there. I decide to <em>donate all liquid income</em> from this post to support them and make it to <strong>$20SBD</strong> (so I can get <em>Bronze </em>at least) if the amount is not enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[CN Version]</p>
<p>親愛的CN區朋友，這篇談的是我如何從過去受到 <strong>@wang</strong> 的支持點讚，至今王的愛仍在，但已經快忘了它的存在。上周發現王開始跟著我點讚，甚至連comment都跟，這讓我非常興奮，因為我好久好久沒有「改變」的能力了！(把0.00變成至少0.01) 有了王跟著我，我點評論至少0.01，點帖至少0.04-0.05，如果已經有些金額，那效果更大！我很高興地到處找被忽略的帖來點，也不多浪費，以免王變心，哈哈！</p>
<p>昨天找到 @pilot 的雪山風景照，只有0.01，心想就是他了，聖誕老人嘛，當然要支持雪景美照啊！所以我們把它變成0.05，自己很高興，那也就夠了。沒想到今天去看，以bernie為首的一群「<strong>聖誕大鯨主</strong>」把那篇提升到$15了！真的是聖誕魔力降臨啊！雖然跟我們不必然有直接關係，但是這故事非常聖誕，不是嗎？</p>
<p>所以我就想把這篇的作者收入，全部貢獻給 busy 計畫，這是我很支持的一個方案，今天才公布捐贈者的未來可以在busy系統裡配戴徽章(鑽石/白金/金/銀/銅不同等級)，我心想應該弄一枚來吧，但是最低的銅章也要捐贈(不是投資喔) $20 SBD，所以後來就想到結合這兩件事，「把愛傳出去」(PayItForward)，但我可能會自己掏錢補足差額吧，20塊太難了，再請多多支持喔！先預祝大家聖誕快樂啦！：）</p>
<h3>Thank you all for your support!!<br>
Anyone can be a Santa if you want! May the SP (Santa Power) be with you!!&nbsp;</h3>
