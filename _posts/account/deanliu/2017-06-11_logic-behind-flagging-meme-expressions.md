<p>Lesson #2 for newbies,... yeah... the formidable <em><strong>FLAGGING</strong></em> or <em><strong>DOWNVOTING</strong></em>!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to avoid it!? Well, to avoid it, you have to <em>understand</em> it first! And today's MEME is going to let you know <em><strong>WHY</strong></em>!? With laughters of course!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we begin, let's review Lesson #1 for <em><strong>UPVOTING</strong></em> here ...</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/funny/@deanliu/logic-behind-upvoting-meme-expressions">LOGIC BEHIND UPVOTING - MEME EXPRESSIONS</a></p>
<blockquote><strong>Newbies!!</strong> While you are excited about this great platform, you must also be very confused about how to get upvotes... Even some veterans don't get it, so don't be frustrated...&nbsp;<br>
This <em><strong>meme series</strong></em> is created for you. While you laugh (then <em><strong>thank you and refer to #5 below and do it!</strong></em>), there is also some truth about Steemit behind it. This takes me almost a year to comprehend, so enjoy!&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Please cherish our beloved Steemit for better or worse! Thank You! :)</strong></blockquote>
