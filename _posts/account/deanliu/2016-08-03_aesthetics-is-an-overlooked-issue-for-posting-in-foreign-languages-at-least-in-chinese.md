<p>It is really enjoyable to read so many quality posts on Steemit everyday. <strong>It is neat, clean and stylish.</strong> </p>
<p>Even a simplest post with a nice picture may look very comfortable. Like this one, borrowing from @ned 's 2 months ago (<a href="https://steemit.com/design/@ned/rfd-the-steem-tree">link</a>):</p>

<p>However, <strong>it not so when we encounter posts in Chinese</strong> (simplified or traditional). See the following example (select one with only words as pic doesn't matter): <em><strong>Top</strong></em>: my hello post to the #cn community in Chinese; <em><strong>Down</strong></em>: I use Word to re-edit the left one. </p>

<h2>What do you think? </h2>
<p>Personally I think the original one is really reader-unfriendly. And the second one is, after my not-at-all-professional 5-min editing, obviously better. I think my fellow Chinese friends here would agree with me (the case with simplified Chinese might be a little bit worse, but I am not 100% sure). </p>
<p>Maybe English readers can't really tell, but I assure you that there is definitely room for improvement. I have also checked posts in Japanese and Korean, but I think they are alright aesthetically. </p>
<p>So far, I think <strong>the only obvious problem right now is in Chinese posts</strong>. Users in any other languages are welcome to comment as well.</p>
<h2><strong>Why is this important?</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>With good graphical design, good posts become great posts</strong></em>. I have read so many English posts that are on par with many quality online articles, in terms of content as well as art design.</p>
<p>If we are to embrace users from all over the planet. Except for translation (see my post here: <a href="https://steemit.com/translation/@deanliu/translation-and-how-we-tackle-it-affects-the-future-scenario-of-steeemit">Translation and how we tackle it affects the future scenario of steemit</a>.), we have to consider <em><strong>the aesthetic factor</strong></em> - the design of post editor, so that <em><strong>online personal publishing will become possible for EVERYONE in every languages</strong></em>. After all, human beings are visual creatures, even more so for potential Steemians.</p>
