[Oranges Shabu (橘色涮涮屋)](http://www.orangeshabu.com.tw/page01.asp) is regarded as the top Shabu Shabu (*originally from Japan*) hot pot in Taipei. Last weekend I finally got to try it. I went with my wife, who has been putting this restaurant on her must-eat list for quite some time. Good for her. I am also a fan of hot pots, just not a fan of expensive ones. But wife's happiness is of utmost importance, isn't it!? ^^

We waited for a couple of minutes before they cleaned up the table so we got two cup of hot tea for us. :) Although they should had put a small table here ... :p

Let's go inside the dining area ... You can see there are many semi-open bamboo or curtain isolated dining spaces. Their decoration is very Japanese or simplistic. Very relaxing.

We were left with the option of sitting by the round counter-top. Those wasn't really bad seats, just different. You get to see what others eat. lol.

Inside there was a big kitchen which you could peep through the window.

If you'd like, there are some Japanese rice wine - ***sake*** too! But we did not order.

Here the waiters will help you put in most of the ingredients except the main ones - we ordered ***Australian Lamb Chops*** and ***Live Scylla Crab***.

While the two pots were cooking, we were served the appetizers - one tomato salad and one tofu salad. hmm... palatable!

No, it's not over yet!! The waiters will cook the special "crab porridge" for you!! See those ingredients they had here? And, without saying, it was superb!! along came with some small dishes as well...

Ok, that's it! We couldn't eat any more so we had the fruits and desserts packed to go ... Sorry I forgot to take some photos afterwards.

Everything was perfect. So I recommend you to try this one if you are not too concerned with budget and if you like hot pots! The lamb meal is about NT$1000 and the crab about $2000 roughly, which are $35 and $70 respectively. Not really a fortune, but no where near cheap too! :)

### <center>高檔食材涮涮鍋：台北橘色涮涮屋</center><br>

台北最近變好冷，前兩天跟老婆去吃了她掛在心頭已久，在涮涮鍋這類火鍋界聞名台北的『橘色』。他們還開了一館二館，生意好到爆。走高價路線，跟我不熟。老婆喜歡，那沒話說。我向來是火鍋咖，只是通常認為吃個石二鍋就可以，哈哈。今天這家可要貴上五六七八倍呢！看倌食客們，自行看前面的圖垂涎吧，大家都常吃火鍋，我也不必多廢話。我們點的是羊肉跟蟹肉，蟹是羊的兩倍價格。這裡服務周到，幫你下料，幫你撈渣，幫你肢解螃蟹，最後還現場幫你煮蟹黃粥呢！位置有半開放式座位與吧台，我們臨時去的，只有吧台位。也不錯，比較熱鬧。有趣的是，當時吧台十幾個客人，只有我一個假美女真男人，女性消費力真是強啊（男的都去吃石二鍋了吧）... 價錢是吧？羊鍋一千台幣，蟹鍋兩千，差不多這樣。失血很多，但這麼有名，總是得來嘗試一次。嘗鮮經驗，分享予你們囉！^^
