<p>Not gonna explain the title if you do not already know it (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auld_Lang_Syne">here</a> for explanation and listen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9m9DuhHBAo">here</a> for a great song for friendship). Basically it says:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HELLO! EVERYONE! I am back and I miss you and all this! So happy to be back!</strong></p>
<p>If you follow this DailyDialogue for the first time, in the previous issue I declared to take a <strong>OWO</strong> (#oneweekoff) and yesterday I posted for the first time after one week. Later I will brief to you on this. I promised to return a better blogger and I think I do feel so as I feel more confident, more composed, with more energy. Hope you stay tuned to find out. Let's do it from now. I have some new changes in this issue and I hope you like them.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Picture of the Day</strong> - <em><strong>I wrote a </strong></em><a href="https://steemit.com/fun/@deanliu/a-dear-wang-letter-how-i-miss-you-and-steemit"><em><strong>Dear Wang Letter</strong></em></a><em><strong> yesterday and @wang upvoted, although later than I expected. This photo is for wang and all of you.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Something New at Steemit</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two for you so far though I think there should be more as I was away for a whole week!</p>
<ol>
  <li>Now we have a <strong>detailed payout breakdown</strong>. I will let my friend @myfirst tell you (click <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@myfirst/just-found-steemit-new-features">here</a>).</li>
  <li>This one actually irritates me: as some of my earliest posts<strong> pass the one month mark, the system just erase all voters data</strong> (number shows 0 too)! Now who can I thank if one day I shall become a whale and wish to say thank you to early supporters? Something I don't like about Steemit at the moment is that it keeps everyone focus on minutes, hours, at most days or weeks, and disregards things that last more than one month. What about those everything is and will be on blockchian claims? I might write another post to complain.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Briefing on My OWO</strong></p>
<p>I actually wrote a 7-day diary for this period. But a detailed experience sharing will be posted later as I don't want to rush. Basically the conclusions are (taking into account what happened to my first return post):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>You should do it too</strong> if you feel too occupied by all these Steemy stuffs. I gained so much during this week off - have time to keep up with my job requirement, have more time for my beloved family, have time to seriously read articles about blockchain world...<strong> refresh and energizing</strong>!</li>
  <li><strong>Nothing will change here that affect your status</strong> (from my experience). I am not talking Steem prices (oh yeah I know!), how many new things new works new collaborations have surfaced... but things that will affect you as an author. As you see, @wang keeps voting on me (of course I cannot rule out it is a one time thing, later I will know). You surly will lose the opportunity to post and earn, to vote and earn and to reply to connect, but that's exactly what you need to let go.</li>
</ul>
<p>After I return, I have decided to change a little bit. First, I wish to cultivate the <strong>#fun </strong>tag more often as I found out that people here are too tense and seriously need to laugh more often. This is partly due to something sad happened during the past week. Second. I will aspire myself to be a quality blogger here. Write less frequently and more selectively. Quoting from my unpublished diary,</p>
<blockquote><strong>Promise a journey, not just a sprint.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote>

<p><strong>HuZ at Steemit</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This is a brand new feature at #dailydialogue</strong>! I promised something new, didn't I? In this place, I am gonna show you some most bizarre, interesting, terrible... figures that I have discovered. As Steemit is totally transparent, I hope the people I introduced won't be mad as this is purely for a laugh. BTW, most of the time I won't introduce celebrities - they have too much spotlights on them already. Okay without further ado, may I introduce, <strong>the most respected mentor in the Chinese history</strong> (check him out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius">here</a>)...<strong> Confucius</strong> is now on Steemit.</p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/25/confu8295c.png</p>
<p>OMG, @confucius here has a negative reputation! Do you know how influential Confucius is in Chinese culture or even at his own time? Definitely highly positive like @danthesuperman . Okay, maybe Steemians here are yet to recognize his wisdom, which is true. See @confucius has only 10 followers. Do you know how many disciples (followers, students...) Confucius had back then? It is 3,000 - 3,000 disciples and many of them become masters later!! Nobody here can achieve that yet. Next, he follows no one. Reasonable, why should he? Then, what!? &nbsp;"confucius hasn't started blogging yet!" Do you know how Confucius made a living back then? He talked and published to get paid or supported, so that means he blogged and A LOT. Fine. looks like @confucius did talk a lot as he has 2,462 posts!! That's the most I have ever seen here. Well done bro, at least <em>you are spreading your wisdom like your ancient counterpart</em>. Let's check out his wise teaching recently...</p>
<blockquote><em>He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.<br>
To know what you know and to know what you don't know that is real wisdom.<br>
To love a thing means wanting it to live.&nbsp;</em></blockquote>
<p>Now I believe. That <strong>@confucius is a true master at Steemit.</strong> That he carries the ancient wisdom with him. That he is yet to be discovered, a hidden gem. Not as author, but a patient mentor that encourages you when you shall need it. Love you @confucius and I hope people here can appreciate you more (they need to click "Show" to see your hidden wisdom covered by prejudice). I have also seen your thin wallet. So as a token of respect and as a token of thank you for being my first HuZ figure, I have sent you one SBD token. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks guys! Let's say something nice to @confucius if you shall meet him commenting your post and upvote to his wisdom as well!</p>
