<h3>@berniesanders: Who &nbsp;are you and do I know you?</h3>
<p>dear berniesanders at steemit, this should be the first time ever that I directly talk to you. You probably even don't know me... well, you are a busy whale and I am just a bigger minnow or at best a small dolphin, and not actively engaging in many debated issues.&nbsp;But of course I know you and see your remarks and actions often, mostly in comments of others' posts. Honestly, I did not spend a lot of time going through those posts that you were involved in. I know that you had a lot of quarrels with some users and meanwhile you were also supported by many (maybe some of them are your friends and even yourselves, yeah, people do that here). Anyhow, I did not take sides as I didn't have much clues of what was going on, but I like your style.</p>
<h3>@berniesanders: Why the hell are you talking to me now?</h3>
<p>okay. I am writing to you in supposedly your final hours as a whale. this is what your wallet shows:</p>
<blockquote>The next power down is scheduled to happen&nbsp; in 5 hours.</blockquote>
<p>I don't do whale-ass kissing. But if anyone insists that this post is exactly that then so be it - at least, this whale is small and going to vanish soon. A small and disappearing ass, yes. According to steemwhales.com, the trend shows that you will not be powering up any time soon. So I think this would be a good timing to say good bye to you as a whale still. So far I have only explained <em><strong>now</strong></em>, but not <em><strong>why</strong></em>.</p>

<p>The reason being very simple - your upvote 7 months ago made my post, a concise one, go trending, shortly after I joined Steemit. It was still in the 12-hour first payout period and once the post payout exceeded $1,000 and later decreased to $700 something. But I did not get that amount, as you vote <em>after</em> the 12 hour period, and I watched the money decreased from 600, 500, to 400 as Steem price dropped. When I finally received the money after 28 days, my cut is <em><strong>$448</strong></em> - still, an amazing amount of money for a newbie like me. Well, I believed in Steemit so I invested in again and that money probably worths only <em><strong>$30</strong></em> now? LOL! What a twist! The later part has nothing to do with you (complaints go to dan and ned, haha!). I mention all these just to let you know that I am grateful for that very upvote of yours, it enabled me to feel what's it like to be on the trending page and it manifested steemit's magic power at that time. Even looking back from this point of time, I have to say it is quite an interesting life, crypto-life, experience! Since I am a grateful person, a thank you in your final whale hours should be appropriate.</p>
<h3>So, thank you and wish you all the best for what you are going to do next.&nbsp;Oh, I won't forget that you <em>were</em> a BAD WHALE.</h3>
<p>Oh, by the way, the issue I mentioned in that post [<a href="https://steemit.com/translation/@deanliu/translation-and-how-we-tackle-it-affects-the-future-scenario-of-steeemit">Translation and how we tackle it affects the future scenario of steeemit</a>], language barriers, has not been tackled so far. :) &nbsp;</p>
<p>best, from @deanliu</p>
