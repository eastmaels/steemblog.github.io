It's a pity that we went to this Ryougoku Sumo Hall on a Monday when it was closed. But we still can walk around it and saw something ***Sumo***. If we had more time and my son were older, we would have gone to a Sumo tournament to watch it live for sure.

The station and the streets of Ryogoku won't let you forget about sumo easily....  Check it out!

*this **Dean's Tokyo Snapshots** series ( #dean-tokyo as a specific tag) is my photographic diary for my family trip to Tokyo. Due to busy schedule and a naughty boy with us, I won't be able to write much but I will make sure that every photo that I choose means something, at least to me... I hope you enjoy this photo series as well as me! Feel free to comment but I probably won't have much time making replies often. Apologies first. :p*

***follow me @deanliu if you haven't! or not, if this does not interest you...^^***
