<p>Since the FAQ and Wiki are not ready yet and I really want to know the answers to my questions about Steemit payout, trust me I have tried to look for answers but failed, so I will<strong> offer $1 SBD for the first satisfactory answers to my questions</strong>. Not much, but I hope this shows how much I appreciate your assistance. Other genuine answers will be upvoted (probably $0.01) to show my gratitude.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok. There are two questions and both are regarding post payout. The first one is really a technical one and actually contains several related questions. The second one is a reflection on recent steem price drop and I need someone who really knows to confirm my guess.</p>
<h3>Q1. About the split between SBD/SP.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Suppose I have a <strong>post first total payout of $X</strong> (this $ means SBD, correct me if wrong). I know that 75% is author's cut and this cut is further split half into SBD and SP. So I will get <strong>0.375X SBD</strong> (which is verified by my past payout). The question is about SP. Generally the number of SP is close to 0.375X (the unit is STEEM) but sometimes it is higher and sometimes lower. I guess since there is a 30 min curation rule so the final SP payout (to author) should be a little more than its SBD counterpart (is that right?). My guess is that the quantity of SP is affected <em>both</em> by the additional reward from early curators and the relative price between SBD/STEEM. Am I correct? If I am all correct on these question marks, please confirm them one by one and add some more details if any without just saying "all correct for Q1."&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Q2. About total payout amount and the price of Steem</h3>
<p>Since there has been a huge drop in Steem price in the past 3 weeks especially the last, it makes me wonder if the price of Steem affect payout amounts? For example, if all the conditions (people who vote and their sequence...) are the same as the $X post in Q1 except that the price of Steem is now 1/3 of Q1. Does it mean now the total payout is now $0.3333..X ? or it is more complicated that that? According to my impression of past trending post payouts, it went from well above 5 thousands or more to current 2-3 thousands, my answer seems to hold but not precise of course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope my questions are clear. Weeks ago I used to post questions and @ajvest was really kind to answer all my questions (and I got very little payout from the post), today not only I will pay for people who answer these questions (or confirm with details) and I will transfer half of SBD from this post to @ajvest as a thank you. Last, I hope some users may also find this post and possible replies useful so as to justify it.&nbsp;</p>
