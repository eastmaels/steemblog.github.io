<p>Today I came across an advertisement promoting <strong>warrants</strong> to the general public at a very busy metro station in central Taipei. The advertisement is so huge that occupied several walls along a key pathway. That means whoever did this spent big bucks doing this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>今天在一個人潮很多的台北捷運(地鐵)站看到巨幅廣告，廣告推銷「權證」(warrants)。廣告佔了好幾個牆面，人潮眾多，是一個非常重要的廣告點，可以想見做廣告的人一定砸了很大一筆錢來做這些廣告。</p>

<h3>The main slogan is THIS IS MY WARRANT STYLE. USE MY OWN MONEY FOR MY OWN DREAM.</h3>
<h3>And it comes with several sub-slogans like: I BUY WARRANTS, I WANT TO HAVE A DREAM OF XXXX.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>And there are four XXXX including: <strong>Becoming a boss</strong>, <strong>Traveling</strong>, <strong>Becoming more fashionable</strong> and <strong>Riding a Harley Davidson motorcycle</strong>. It is clear that their target is the younger generation of workers who cannot afford to fulfill those dreams mentioned.</p>
<p>廣告主要的標語是「這是我的權證STYLE，用自己的錢買自己的夢。」次標題是：我買權證，我想擁有老闆夢。我買權證，我想擁有旅遊夢。我買權證，我想擁有時尚夢。我買權證，我想擁有重機夢。很明顯這廣告針對的是年輕上班族，尤其是那些其實真的很難用自己賺的錢滿足這些夢的年輕人。</p>

<p>I was really shocked and angry to see this advertisement. This should be banned. When I was younger, I was once bewildered by warrants - you only need to spend a little amount of money but you might get many times of it in return! It took me a while to realize that values of most of warrants go to <em>zero </em>since time is also part of its value. Despite the fact that it is indeed a tool for hedging investment, for small buyers they are no more than<strong> a gamble</strong> with legitimate status.</p>
<p>看到這廣告，我既驚訝又生氣，這些廣告應該都要被禁的。我年輕的時候也曾經被權證迷惑過，幾千塊錢就可以投資，而且潛在獲利可能是好幾倍！買了幾次之後我才願意承認，其實權證最後價值都會歸零，因為這就是所謂衍生性商品，「時間」內含在價錢內，而其目標區間通常很難達到，最後都回歸於零。這些商品，確實有其所謂投資避險的功能，但是大家都知道，其實為數眾多的小投資人，都把它當賭博，一種有合法地位看似正當投資的賭博。</p>
<p>Now they are so desperate to target those young generation makes me sick. Maybe 4 out of 1000 becomes a boss, gets to travel to a dream place, buys a Chanel bag and possesses a fancy motorcycle. But 996 of them will just lose their money. All they can get is the <strong>short moment of dreaming</strong>.</p>
<p>這些賣權證的傢伙，現在竟然如此囂張地往年輕人下手，令人感到不齒。1000人裡面，可能有4個人真的可以美夢成真吧，但是966個人的投資最後都是血本無歸，他們賺到的，只是<strong>短暫作夢的權力</strong>而已。&nbsp;</p>
