<p>Two days ago, as the dev team <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@steemitblog/introducing-promoted-content#@deanliu/re-steemitblog-introducing-promoted-content-20160830t054221867z">introduced Promoted Content</a>, many Steemians were so excited and tried this new feature including me. When I found out that posts older than one day can also be promoted, I thought this could be a bug as the above post did not mention this. So I thought why not give it a try as I really wanted to give my old posts a second chance. But I knew it was a fluky move. So I did not put serious money into it either - probably $7 for a dozen posts. These old posts all showed up on the promoted pages (mostly under specific tags as my money is small) but soon I saw @jesta 's <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@jesta/psa-don-t-use-the-promote-post-feature-on-a-post-that-s-already-paid-out#@deanliu/re-jesta-psa-don-t-use-the-promote-post-feature-on-a-post-that-s-already-paid-out-20160830t050727679z">kind reminder</a> warning that this would lead to a one-vote only result. I then knew that my money was gone but felt so funny that I wanted to fool the system but get fooled! It is not big money anyway.</p>
<p>This morning just 2 hours ago, I saw my wallet get refund from the system (actually from @zaebars - why?!) with a memo saying "refund for a post promotion bug". I do feel a little bit embarrassed and moved as I did know my risk when doing these but the platform is very decent to refund the money. Thank you so much! So I have to let more people know this: <strong>Steemit is a honest platform</strong>!!</p>

<p>What about efficient?! Aside from "refunding" the moeny so quickly, they have also fixed a bug that I mentioned under the first post about being able to "promote" a "reply". They have found and fixed it maybe just a little more than 24 hours!&nbsp;That's very efficient, don't you think!?&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Lately, I have been too negative about things going on here, but these actions by the platform along with @jamielefay the Steemit novelist's postive remarks to me has made me positive and optimistic again! Like I once said - "</em><em><strong>promise a journey, not just a sprint</strong></em><em>". Come on! Steem on!</em></p>
<p><em><strong>An Update! Could anyone who plans to upvote this post check the following post and upvote there instead of here as that post deserves much much more than mine!</strong></em></p>
