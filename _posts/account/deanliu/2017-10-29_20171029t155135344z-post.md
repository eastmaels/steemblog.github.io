Photos (yeah, some will be added in the comments) were taken in a hotel room in Regent Taipei. The view is fantastic and we really enjoyed sitting in front of the floor-to-ceiling window and watching how this city changes her appearance under different or no sunlights. This is actually my first steepshot trial post.
