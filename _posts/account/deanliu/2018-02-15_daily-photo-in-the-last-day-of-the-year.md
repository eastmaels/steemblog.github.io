Chinese people all over the world in the last few days have probably been busy cleaning their houses for welcoming the Chinese new year of dog... In this process, many unused or broken furnitures/items are dumped, so people can move on to a brand new life.

I just hope that we all know what's really important for our lives and hold on to it, and not to abandon the true treasures by mistakes.

Happy Lunar New Year of Dog, everyone!! Wish you a prosperous year ahead!! 

除夕夜將至，狗年在旺。新年總是需要新氣象，家家戶戶都做好大掃除了吧！

除舊布新，生生不息。在這欣喜的過程裡，但願大家都已做好新年功課！希望那些真正重要的事物，我們都能好好抓牢緊握，而沒有一不小心讓它們錯失在我們的生命裡。

朋友們，祝願每個人都狗年旺旺好運來！
