<p><em>For the past three weeks, I have gave away $15 SBD in total to three different Steemians (see </em><a href="https://steemit.com/cn/@deanliu/a-sunday-usd5-sbd-giveaway-if-you-can-recognize-this-nice-cafe"><em>#1</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://steemit.com/cn/@deanliu/a-sunday-usd5-sbd-giveaway-if-you-recognize-this-cafe-2"><em>#2</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://steemit.com/cn/@deanliu/a-sunday-usd5-sbd-giveaway-if-you-recognize-this-cafe-3"><em>#3</em></a><em>) and the first two are both interesting and the winners both blogged about this experience in their blog... The last dude ... well, I haven't heard from him/her ever since.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>This week, I am changing this game a little bit as 1) $5 SBD is now less affordable to me and 2) I am running out of cafes but have some dinning experiences to share. So, this time let's have fun with more people! I am going to offer two meal selections to you, both of which I had last week, and if you take the 'correct' side in the end, you will get a small prize for fun!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>朋友們，本周不猜咖啡廳了，我已經快沒有適當的咖啡廳可以用了。猜謎送獎方式也改變一下，第一，SBD現在有價值多了，我已經快送不起 $5 SBD了，改成多人參與，更多人有獎的方式，或許也好玩一些。只要你選對邊吃飯，你就有機會拿獎喔！</strong></p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/25/Titles8b3af.png</p>
<p><strong>So, in the following we have three parts: first, </strong><code><strong>the rules for this SBD giveaway</strong></code><strong>; second, the presentation of</strong><code><strong> Set A Meal</strong></code><strong>; third, the presentation of </strong><code><strong>Set B Meal</strong></code><strong>. Join now by replying your choice and may the best gourmet side wins!</strong></p>
<p><strong>以下會有三部分：一、送獎規則與簡介；二、套餐Set A上菜；三、套餐Set B上菜。選中贏的一邊的話，你就進入獲獎隊伍囉！</strong></p>
<h2>Rules and Introduction 送獎規則與簡介</h2>
<p><strong>Ladies and Gentlemen, tonight we have prepared for you two exquisite selections of Asian style meals from two different restaurants - the first one is Set A, the traditional Chinese cuisine by </strong><code><strong>Golden Chicken</strong></code><strong> which specialized in Jiangsu and Zhejian cuisine; the second one is Set B, the flavor of freshness from sea by </strong><code><strong>Waisanding Sand Bar</strong></code><strong> which is famous for their fresh seafood especially oysters and milkfish. Details in the following. Both meals are not expensive and cost around USD $11-$12. So this is en equal contest between meals as well.</strong></p>
<p><strong>女士們先生們，今晚為你們準備的是兩套亞洲美食精選，都是我個人上周在台北吃過的餐廳，價錢也差不多在11-12美元左右，雙人份量。套餐A來自金雞園－傳統江浙點心名店，其小籠包與糕點都是名菜；套餐B來自外傘頂洲－海鮮來自當日台灣雲林縣外海的外傘頂洲的連鎖餐廳，牡蠣(蚵仔)與虱目魚是其主要賣點。菜色詳情以下會詳細介紹。</strong></p>
<p><strong>The rules for this giveaway are:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>How to Join</strong>: Just reply with your selection of either Set A or Set B and you are in. Each account is allowed only one answer. Notice that all entries must be made BEFORE the first payout - that's the cutoff point for deciding the Winning Side.</li>
  <li><strong>Decision of Winning Side</strong>: After the first payout, I will count the valid entries from both sides (A and B) and the one with more votes is the <strong>Winning Side</strong>! Note the votes here is not 'upvotes' but your selection of meals only. So, nothing to do with your SP, your vote counts equally with @dantheman if he participates (not likely though :p). Sounds good!? This is food democracy! [if we have a tie, then EACH side will be rewarded!]</li>
  <li><strong>Giveaway PRIZES</strong>: For the first 5 entries (1st-5th) on the Winning Side, each will get <code><strong>$0.3 SBD</strong></code>; Subsequent 5 entries (6th-10th) get <code><strong>$0.2 SBD</strong></code> and the next 10 entries (11th-20th) get <code><strong>$0.1 SBD</strong></code>. Total prize pool is $3.5 SBD. Sorry the economy is not as good as one week ago... But there is something to hope for... see next</li>
  <li><strong>Pray for MULTIPLICATION</strong>: All the prizes will be MULTIPLIED should the total payout exceeds <code>$15</code>. The multiplier will be <code><strong>M=(total first payout)/15</strong></code>. For example, if the payout turns out to be $60 (same number with my rep now :p), then M=4 and all prizes are 4 times bigger! So the first 5 on winning side gets $1.2 SBD and etc... &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>給獎規則</strong>：</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>參與</strong>：在本帖回覆你選擇套餐A或套餐B即可，每人只能有一個答案。必須在第一次payout結束前回覆才有效，屆時會決定哪邊是獲勝套餐Winning Side。</li>
  <li><strong>獲勝套餐</strong>：第一次payout結束後計票，票多者獲選為獲勝套餐Winning Side，選擇正確的才有獲獎資格。注意在這裡票票等值，跟你的SP無關，就算dan來參加，他的一票也跟你一樣，開心吧？[如果平手，則兩邊一起給獎！]</li>
  <li><strong>給獎標準</strong>：選擇獲勝套餐Winning Side的投票者當中，前5位可獲得<strong>$0.3 SBD</strong>，5-10位可獲得<strong>$0.2 SBD</strong>，11-20位可獲得<strong>$0.1 SBD</strong>。總獎值為$3.5 SBD。抱歉！目前Steem不景氣，跟上周比是差多了，不過，還有機會可以擴大獎項...</li>
  <li><strong>獎項倍增</strong>：如果本帖payout超過<strong>$15</strong>，則將進行獎項倍增：<strong>乘數M</strong>是(本帖實際收入)/$15。例如如果本帖能達到$60，則倍增乘數為4，所有獎項將乘上4倍！</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hints:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Select what you really like or if you don't have clear preference, select what you think others will like...</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Enjoy the picking process. Don't worry about the tiny prizes...&nbsp;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>If you are late to the game, well, count yourself and see which side has better odds</strong></li>
  <li><strong>If you do care about the prizes, Ring Your Whale Friends to upvote and trigger the MULTIPLICATION, if you think you will end up on the winning side.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>溫馨提示：</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>選擇你所愛，享受美食幻想，不用太在乎獎項；如果你沒有偏好，那猜猜別人喜歡什麼也不錯</strong></li>
  <li><strong>如果你比較晚看到，那麼先數數前面的投票狀況或許有助於你獲獎</strong></li>
  <li><strong>如果你眼見你有機會獲獎，趕緊通知你的大鯨魚朋友來助陣，協助啟動獎項倍增機制！</strong></li>

<p><strong>In this delicate and delicious meal, we will serve steamed dumpling or aka Xiao Long Bao, Pearl Balls or rice meat balls, seafood porridge with egg yolk,&nbsp;fried beancurd puff with vermicelli soup and finally the dessert - Eight Precious Sweet Rice.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>首先，套餐A，金雞園江浙風味傳統中華美食。今天菜色包括：小籠包、珍珠丸子、海鮮粥、油豆腐細粉，以及最後來個八寶甜飯！你看得懂中文大概也不用我多介紹了，好好用眼睛吃吃看吧！</strong></p>
<p><strong>First, the Xiao Long Bao, served with ginger shreds and soysauce.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/25/1474633621802a628d.jpg</p>
<p><strong>Take a small bite and release its essence... &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/25/14746336252846306f.jpg</p>
<p>Pearl Balls. Steamed meal balls with rice coating. Yum.</p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/25/14746336164431fc54.jpg</p>
<p><strong>Seafood porridge with egg yolk. Hot and Good!</strong></p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/25/1474633611363ff30a.jpg</p>
<p><strong>After you stir it up a little bit, it looks so beautiful and now you can see some seafood inside. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/25/14746336144133ba3f.jpg</p>
<p><strong>Fried beancurd puff with vermicelli soup. This is just another famous traditional JiangZhe dish.</strong></p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/25/1474633596865557b1.jpg</p>
<p><strong>Something sweet to finish - Eight Precious Sweet Rice. Sweet!</strong></p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/25/1474633592248b7a3d.jpg</p>
<p><strong>Take a look around the restaurant. Some news reports (</strong><a href="http://travel.ettoday.net/article/276785.htm"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="http://iamhao.pixnet.net/blog/post/29774559-%E5%8F%B0%E5%8C%97%E5%85%AC%E9%A4%A8%E3%80%82%E9%87%91%E9%9B%9E%E5%9C%92%E3%80%82%E5%B9%B3%E5%83%B9%E6%B1%9F%E6%B5%99"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>) even compare it, the Golden Chicken, with Din Tai Fung (if you don't know this restaurant, see @ace108 's </strong><a href="https://steemit.com/photography/@ace108/dining-one-of-the-top-10-gourmet-restaurants-in-the-world-by-ace108"><strong>report</strong></a><strong> from Singapore). Well, honestly, it is not as good as DTF, but given the price level, it may be comparable!</strong></p>
<p><strong>金雞園40年老餐廳內部的樣子。有些新聞報導甚至將之比擬為平價版的鼎泰豐。平心而論，還是有差距，但考慮價格的話，那可不一定誰勝出啦！</strong></p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/25/A-R46e79.png</p>
<h3><strong>Don't rush making your decision, keep looking!</strong></h3>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/25/TitleB23819.png</p>
<p><strong>Okay then. You do have other options and this coming one is definitely a good one! Set B is a fantastic meal from nature's offerings. If you love seafood, it might steal your stomach. We will serve fried shrimp rolls rice combo, oysters fried noodles,&nbsp;milkfish soup, oyster soup, fried beancurd and boiled vegetables. If Set A is about flavors from a long long time ago, then Set B is about flavors to your mouth in no time from the nature!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>好了，接下來是完全另一種風情。套餐B是走自然新鮮路線的台灣當地美味，喜歡海鮮的朋友可能更愛這個。上菜了，餐點內容有炸蝦捲飯、牡蠣炒麵、虱目魚湯、牡蠣湯、炸豆腐與燙青菜等小菜... 如果套餐A販賣的是古老與時間的醞釀，那麼套餐B賣的就是跟時間賽跑要把大自然風味馬上送到你五臟府的心意。我相信你們都看得懂這美妙的食材可能的滋味啊！</strong></p>
<p><strong>First one is the fried shrimp rolls rice combo. I cut the roll open to let you see inside stuffing - it is crispy, juicy and delicious!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/25/IMG_20160924_122853942a5.jpg</p>
<p><strong>Oysters fried noodles - my favorite dish here. Fried with lots of garlic and fresh oysters directly from the sea (the restaurant name is actually the place where all seafood are from).&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/25/14746944060769d6c0.jpg</p>
<p><strong>Milkfish soup. Milkfish is a very famous cultivated Taiwan fish which contains a lot of good proteins and hence considered very nutritious.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/25/IMG_20160924_1233120a907.jpg</p>
<p><strong>Oyster soup. It is cooked with some sauerkraut to enhance the flavor. Don't bite your tongue.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/25/IMG_20160924_124718bcc0d.jpg</p>
<p><strong>Side dishes like fried beancurd and boiled vegetables to give you balanced diet.</strong></p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/25/IMG_20160924_123333b37a8.jpg</p>
<p><strong>Last, an overview for your final consideration.</strong></p>
<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/25/1474694410142c1939.jpg</p>
<p><strong>Take a look around as well. The bottom shows where the place (also the restaurant name) is in Taiwan.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>餐廳裝潢沒什麼特別，畫面下方是外傘頂洲(也是餐廳名)的位置所在，是雲林縣外海的一個沙洲，有許多養殖漁業。</strong></p>

<h3><strong>That's it, folks! Now it is time for you to decide: Set A? or Set B?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bon appetite and have fun!!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3><strong>好了！抉擇時間到了，套餐A？還是套餐B？好好享受吧！</strong></h3>

<p><em><strong>My reputation just reaches 60... Sweet! ^_^&nbsp;分享一下，聲譽剛剛達到60，本帖也可以到60嗎？ ^___^ 好玩就好！</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE! The winning side, a little bit to my surprises, is 8-to-1 Set A!! but, unfortunately Multiplication is not activated... still all 8 voters have been given the prize and the lonely Set B supporter is also given a $0.1 as thank you! Seems most people still go for oriental flavor! Thank you all upvoters and participants. It is a nice outcome!</strong></p>
