When it comes to the trees in Xinjiang, everyone may think of diversifolious poplar. Indeed, diversifolious poplar is very famous. It is a miraculous species. It is like the spirit of the Tarim people. It does not die for a thousand years, not fall for a thousand years after death, immortal after a thousand years. It stands for thousands of years and thousands of years lonely.

In fact, in addition to diversifolious poplar, there are many trees in Xinjiang, such as poplars, such as weeping willows. On almost every side of the road, there are straight white poplars standing on the side of each artificially irrigated irrigation river, with graceful weeping willows drifting in the wind.

Today, I will introduce you to a Shenmu Garden, Tianshan Shenmu Garden. Although there is Tianshan in the name, it is still a little away from Tianshan Mountains. It is located 60 kilometers northwest of the county town of Wensu County in Xinjiang Aksu area. It is 1,700 meters above sea level and covers an area of ??more than 700 acres. It is called the former mountainous area on the south side of the Tianmu Mountain in Tianshan, Xinjiang. For the "Gobi Pearl".

The Uighur language of the Tianshan Shenmu Garden is "Kurmis Atamu Maza", a graveyard for the passing of saints, a holy place for Islamic gatherings and pilgrimages in history.

It is rumored that in the 11th century AD, a famous imam in Saudi Arabia ("imam" is Persian, meaning a mentor, is a mentor guiding Islamic life.), with more than 2,000 believers, to the Western Region of China ( It is now Xinjiang) to go to preach, was resisted by local residents and there was a military conflict. Most of the believers and imam died together and were buried here.

So here is actually a group of tombs distributed on the mounds that are tens of meters above the ground. There are more than 100 ancient trees with a young age of 300 years and more than a thousand years of age, and there are many unique shapes in the garden. Most of them have various spiral shapes due to the long-term fixed wind direction.

Until now, there have often been Muslims gathering in the Shenmu Garden to carry out the Muslim activities. In order to protect this holy land, in 1986, Wensu County allocated a total of 40,000 yuan, and the masses of enthusiastic people donated more than 100,000 yuan. They repaired it and began to publicize it. It became a tourist attraction.

The Shenmu Garden is in the Gobi Desert, surrounded by ridiculousness, but there are many kinds of trees in the garden, including almonds, poplar, ash, elm, walnut, and willow. Some of these ancient trees are squatting on the ground, like dragons and tigers, and some are twisted and twisted, which is amazing. There are also some giant trees. Although the roots are already decaying, they are still flourishing.

This is my trip, welcome everyone to visit.

说到新疆的树，可能大家都会想起胡杨。确实，胡杨是非常有名的，是一个神奇的物种，它像极了塔里木人的精神——活着一千年不死，死后一千年不倒，倒后一千年不朽，千年伫立，又千年孤独。

实际上，除了胡杨，新疆还有很多树，比如白杨，比如垂柳。几乎在每一条公路的两边，都有挺直得白杨矗立，几乎在每一条人工开垦的灌溉河流边，都有婀娜多姿的垂柳随风飘曳。

今天，就给大家介绍一个神木园——天山神木园。虽然名字里面有天山，但是它距离天山还有点距离，位于新疆阿克苏地区温宿县境内县城西北60公里，海拔1700米，占地700余亩，新疆天山托木尔峰南侧前山区，被称为“戈壁明珠”。

天山神木园的维吾尔语是“库尔米什阿塔木麻扎”，为传经圣人的坟地，是历史上伊斯兰教集会和朝拜的圣地。

据传，在公元11世纪，沙特阿拉伯的一位有名的阿訇（“阿匐”是波斯语，意思是导师，是指导伊斯兰生活的导师。），带着2千多名信徒，到中国西域（也就是现在的新疆）去传教，受到了当地居民的抵制并发生了武力冲突，大部分教徒和阿訇一起战死，被埋在了这里。

所以这里实际上是分布在高出地面几十米的土丘上的一处墓葬群。园内分布着树龄少则300年，多则千年以上的古树百余颗，并呈现出千姿百态的别致造型，多数因长年的固定风向造成各种各样的螺旋状，叹为观止。

直到现在，还经常有伊斯兰教徒在神木园聚集进行穆圣活动。为了保护这一圣地，在1986年温宿县财政拨款4万元，广大的热心群众自发捐款十几万元，对这里进行了修缮，并开始对外宣传，成了一处旅游胜地。

神木园处于戈壁荒丘之中，周围一片荒芜，但是在园内，却有很多种类的树木，有杏树，杨树，白蜡树，榆树，核桃树，柳树等。这些古树有些匍匐在地，就像龙盘虎踞，有些长得曲折盘旋，令人叹为观止。还有一些巨树，虽然根部已经腐朽，但是仍然枝叶茂盛，堪称奇迹。

这就是我的旅行，欢迎大家都来玩。 <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://kissfirer.000webhostapp.com/2018/08/beautiful-shenmu-garden-in-xinjiang-aksu-%e6%96%b0%e7%96%86%e9%98%bf%e5%85%8b%e8%8b%8f%e7%9a%84%e7%be%8e%e4%b8%bd%e7%a5%9e%e6%9c%a8%e5%9b%ad </em><hr/></center>
