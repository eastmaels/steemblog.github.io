**许三多说，好好活就是要做有意义的事，那到底什么才是有意义的事呢？他又说了，有意义的事情就是好好活。**
> Xumumu says that to live well is to do something meaningful. What is meaningful? He added that the meaningful thing is to live well.

**生活就是这样，所有的事情纠缠在一起，此生彼长，互为因果。**
> Life is like this, all things are entangled together, this life is long, each other causes each other.

**现在写的每一篇文字，单独来看可能没有什么意思（当然在写的时候总是想让它有意义的，可人生不如意十之八九），如果坚持写下去，那么若干年后，再翻看这些文字，则可以看到自己的成长轨迹，认识了什么人，去了哪些地方，干了些什么事，感情，思想发生了什么变化，到底经过怎样的修炼才慢慢变成了现在的样子。**
> Every text that is written now may have nothing to do with a single point of view (of course, when it is written, it is always meant to make it meaningful, but life is unsatisfactory.) if you stick to it, then after a few years, then look at these words, you can see your own growth track, know who and what to go. What has happened, what feelings and thoughts have changed in the place, and what kind of practice has really become the way it is now?

**翻看记录这个动作本身，会深切影响着我们的变化。这是自己的传记，记录积累着生活的点点滴滴。而存放这些文字的载体，是时光的储蓄罐。**
> Looking at the action itself will profoundly affect our changes. This is a biography of myself, and records accumulate bits and pieces of life. The carrier for storing these words is the money pot of time.

**不要问我这有什么意义。人类文明之所以能够发展壮大，和书籍的出现，知识的积累传承密不可分。**
> Don't ask me what it means. The development of human civilization is closely related to the emergence of books and the accumulation and accumulation of knowledge.

**人的记忆会消退，扭曲，文字真实的记录，能让我们更加清醒。**
> The memory of people will fade away, distorted, and the real record of words can make us more sober.

**至少，这样做，不会让我们活着活着就忘了自己是谁。**
> At least, doing so will not keep us alive and forget who we are.

**看看机器英文有啥作用不，会中文的自动忽略这些字母。**
