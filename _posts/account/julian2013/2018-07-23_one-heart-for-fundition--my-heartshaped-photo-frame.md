This is the picture of my childhood (right) and my son (left)  last year. I didn't feel anything when I saw it alone. As a result, I found the picture wall, unintentionally hanging together,This kid is absolutely my own child.

The two hands that form the heart-shaped, one is mine, the other is my wife's. This child is our favorite, we love him forever.

>这是我小时候（右）和我儿子去年的照片，单独看的时候还没有什么感觉，结果家里做照片墙，无意中挂在一起的时候，才发现——这基因传递得还是挺规矩的么。

>组成心形的这两只手，一只是我的，一只是我妻子的。这个小孩是我们的心头肉，我们永远爱他。

With this I conclude my entry for the #oneheart contest. Whether I win anything or not, I hope my message delivered and people be benefitted from it. Refer below for more detail of this contest host by @funditian
