My American friend sent this pic to me with her funny T-shirt.
Actually she falls in love with Korean Dramas & Music,
so her boyfriend is somewhat upset.
Then he made and gave her this T-shirt to express his mind (but he still loves her).
Will she love him more or still K-Dramas & Music? HaHaHa~~

제 미국인 친구가 보내준 재미있는 사진입니다.
워낙에 한류에 빠져있다 보니 남자 친구가 많이 섭섭했었나 봐요.
이 앙증맞은 티셔츠를 선물하다니.. ㅋㅋ
고심 끝에 선택했을 남친의 배려가 귀엽게 느껴집니다.
