It's one of hot issue these days if the Steemit system is a Ponzi or not. Hum... No..No..No.. It "must be" the only hot issue soon, cause Steemit must be the next..or over the Facebook later. If someone asks me "What's your opinion about it?", I'm absolutely able to answer like this, "Don't be worry, just enjoy it with us."

Then how could I make a judgment like that? Do I have any consultant like King Solomon? (Of course not.) Let's think about the Ponzi scheme. Ponzi can run until the 'Entry Fee' from new joiners is less than the last amount to keep whole system. Someone, who is negative for the Steemit, would say "That's what I tell you!"

But Steemit is different, I garantee. The puporse of Steemit is to make activated itself. Whales support active participants to get good rewards. Even greedy voters click on awsome contents like writings, photos, and drawings. And common people like me just enjoy good contents and sincerely want to spread to others.

Those mechanism take after the Capitalism. Where is from your money in your pocket? Is is from your company? Then, where is from the money of company? From the other company? Where is from the money of the other company? Is it from the government? Let's think about it. Where is whole wealth on earth from? From gold?

When we believe the value of something, and trade it with value.. the trust for that make a economical eco-system. The capital society with 'paper money' prove it. But this is just one of reasons why the Ponzi and Steemit are different. So many members in Steemit try to estimate, trade, buy, sell, keep, introduce, and so on.. Those acting make itself activated, and it makes 'Boom' ! It means another type of economic system exist at last.

Don't be worry. You can forget all I told you. Instead, think about risk of joining steemit. Is it too harmful to you? Is it too risky with you money? Of course, you can push your time, passion, reputation, and even money into Steemit. But even it's suddenly gone to sky, you just lose some time, some passion, some reputation, some money. Well.. but I think you can leave your good memory with joy. Isn't it?
