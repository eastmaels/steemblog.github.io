Tetouan is the first major Moroccan town I reached after landing from Gibraltar Straight. When I walked through the lively souq in its old medina, I saw this vendor reading attentively next to his stand, enjoying his peace in the hustle and bustle.  

It's a beautiful sunny afternoon with a bit breeze. The man was standing in the sunshine and the tip of his scarf was flying in the wind. I liked this frame at the street corner - he's in his own world accompanied by that French magazine, so I captured this moment before I moved on.

It's my entry for @derangedvisions' Deranged Photography Contest - Portraits. In his words, 

>Portraits are more than just taking a picture of a person and calling it finished. A good portrait captures the emotion and personality of the person. It can also tell a story of what the person is going through or who they are. When you look at a good portrait, you should be able to know something about that person.

## 
Now that the Creative Coin and the front end https://www.creativecoin.xyz have been released, he's  going to reward  the winners with CCC. Don't hesitate to join the fun and grab some coins if you also have portraits to share!

 坐船越过直布罗陀海峡后，得土安是我来到摩洛哥领土上的第一个主要城市，也是这次摩洛哥之旅中我最喜欢的人文之地。这座“白城”地方不大，处处散发着古朴的韵味，整个老城都被联合国教科文组织列为世界文化遗产。

一个暖暖的午后，阳光正好，轻风习习。我在老城的市集闲逛时，看到这位卖家，静静地站在街角自己的小摊边，聚精会神地读着本法语杂志，仿佛将整个熙熙攘攘、人头攒动的闹市都置于身外。他的帽子很有民族特色，围巾的末端在风中微微扬起。这帧画面就像电影中的一幕，引我端起相机按下了快门。

这闹市中沉浸于自我世界的画面让我想起以前另一张抓拍的照片，在柬埔寨首都金边的中央市场：

Here's another photo I posted before - also people in their own world at a busy market:
