Hi my Steemit friends, I'm thrilled to have discovered the fresh new Minimalist Photography Contest by @minnowhale, check out his post that I resteemed and join the fun! It reminds me of the Simple Sunday Photo Contest hosted by @shadalene, but seems she's tied up with other priorities recently. 

I have been experimenting on minimal-style photos, but once I find this contest, I feel like cramming my post with 20 minimalist photos, which is not so minimal. ;) In fact, the contest allows max 2 entries, so I will divide my effusive flow of photos and thoughts into a few posts, to include in my Minimalist Series. 

Here's my first entry - a bird I spotted on a tree at the Green Point Reserve in Sydney, Australia.

It was getting dark that evening, and I noticed this bird resting on a branch by Watsons Bay. The beautiful silhouettes looked like a Chinese ink painting to me. The photo in black and white displays the structure and elements pretty well. If there were less twigs on the branch, it might be even better. What do you think of it? Tell me in the comments please! :)

<center>大家好！这是我简洁风系列的第一张摄影作品，摄于悉尼的屈臣氏湾。
感兴趣的小伙伴也可以查看我转发的活动文章，去参加这个摄影比赛。主办人要求最多发两张照片，奖励也很少，但是因为我很喜欢简洁风，在接下来的系列文章中，会奉上多张类似风格的摄影和关于这一风尚的生活感悟。欢迎留言分享你的想法和体验！=) </center>
