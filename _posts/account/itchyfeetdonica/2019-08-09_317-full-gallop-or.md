Trying horse riding in Mongolia is part of the reason I chose to stop there on my Trans-Siberian  journey from Russia to China. 


The coach was demonstrating how to ride, and I captured this moment from my horseback. It is my entry for @derangedvisions' Photography Contest - Action Shots. 


If someone had shot photos of me riding then, I'm sure it's nothing cool like this. ;) Soon my horse started to gallop very fast, up and down the slopes, through the woods and across the brooks... and the fear and fun can be described with this photo I once posted:

My favorite horse riding experiences include one on a volcano trip in Iceland, one in the Elqui Valley of Chile, and this one in Mongolia is definitely the cream of the crop. 

It felt totally different. The master was not accompanying, so there's only me and the horse in wild nature. I miss that incredible rush and wonderful sense of freedom. It's probably the closest to flying I ever got on the ground. 


Perhaps (rural) Mongolians are born to be riders. This thought came to my mind when I saw those local teenagers as well as adults running freely on their horsebacks through the steppe and hills. That's their vast land; that's their wild world. It's just such a natural. It's like... I was born to be able to... hmmm, use chopsticks? Haha, I just can't find anything that I could do so naturally and skillfully... ;)  It's also amazing to see the locals' intense bond with their horses. I guess that's an integral part of their life.

在蒙古的大草原上，抱着马背纵横驰骋~~饱受惊吓~~，是我选择西伯利亚之旅途中在那里停留的原因之一。勇猛的蒙古汉子策马狂奔，示范我怎么驾驭骏马， 我就在自己的马背上拍下了这瞬间。
