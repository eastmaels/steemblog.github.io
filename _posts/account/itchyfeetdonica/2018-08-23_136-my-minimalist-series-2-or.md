What's up fellow Steemians! As I mentioned yesterday, I'm thrilled to have discovered the fresh new Minimalist Photography Contest by @minnowhale. Check out his post that I resteemed and join the photo fun! 

And the #monomad photography project initiated by @brumest doesn't require certain daily topics anymore! I read about the new rules from [this post](https://steemit.com/monomad/@monochromes/monomad-august-23rd-winning-picks-and-honorable-mentions) in which my monochrome photo is featured. So if you are posting black and white photography, feel free to use the tag, and check out @monochromes for more details if you are interested! 

I have been experimenting on minimal-style photos, but once I find this Minimalist Photography Contest, I feel like cramming my post with 20 minimalist photo entries, which is not so minimal. ;) 

In fact, the contest allows max 2 entries, so I will divide my effusive flow of photos and thoughts into different posts, to include in my Minimalist Series. Since I want to share more than 2 minimal-style photos and some relevant thoughts, this series will be presented in over 2 posts. 

Yesterday I posted a bird & branch photo from Sydney, and here's my second entry of another bird - a flamingo in flight.

I was strolling in the National Reserve of Flamingos (Reserva National Los Flamencos) in the Atacama region of Chile, when I captured this flamingo flying in the sky over the vast salt flat. Yes, I will post some minimal photos about the  salt flats too in my coming posts. Oh, and the Atacama desert, a great source for minimalist style photography! 

What do you think of it? Tell me in the comments please! :)

<center>大家好！这是我简洁风系列的第二张摄影作品，拍于智利北部阿塔卡马沙漠地区的火烈鸟国家保护区内。当时，这只巨大的火烈鸟展翅飞掠过我脚下那片广袤无边的干旱盐田。
~~当然这张照片里是看不到盐田的😏~~
盐田本身也是很好的简洁风素材，还有那线条利落、绵延起伏的沙丘。
时间太少，故事太多！

感兴趣的小伙伴也可以查看我转发的活动文章，去参加这个摄影比赛。主办人要求最多发两张照片，奖励也很少，但是因为我很喜欢简洁风，在接下来的系列文章中，会奉上多张类似风格的摄影和关于这一风尚的生活感悟。欢迎留言分享你的想法和体验！=) </center>
