I took this photo in a village near Turmi, south of Ethiopia. I was strolling the streets of the village when these cute kids came to me to say hello. They were quite curious about me, this strange outsider, just as I was curious about their community and culture. 

They tried to talk to me in loads of funny gestures they just improvised, and they were wearing the big smile on their face through the whole conversation(though it’s more like a communication by body languages ;p). I don’t think we understood everything from each other, but no worries there, all people smile in the same language.

I love their beautiful contagious smile. 😄 A smile costs nothing, but gives much. Their lovely smile brightens my day. Pretty often we underestimate the power of a smile, the gorgeous curve that sets everything straight. So smile more, it lights up yourself as well as the others around. 😃

这张照片是我在埃塞俄比亚南部图米附近的一个小村庄拍的。我当时在街上漫无目的地闲逛，这些可爱的孩子看到我这个异样的外族人，都跑过来争先恐后地跟我打招呼。一个个手舞足蹈，脸上绽放出快乐无比的笑容，我的心情也变得灿烂起来。😃 

他们对我充满好奇，正如我对他们的村落和文化充满好奇一样。我们都开心地笑着，打着各种手势试图和对方交流，虽然并不能完全互相理解，但是这又有什么关系呢？各族语言不同，却有着共同的语言：微笑。

微笑它很神奇，
你不花毫厘，
却有良多获益，
点亮了他人，
也绽放着自己。

哈哈 我这是一不小心成了鸡汤诗人了吗？
