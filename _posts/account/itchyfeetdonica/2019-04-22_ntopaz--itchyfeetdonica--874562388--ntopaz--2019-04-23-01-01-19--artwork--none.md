The horrible attacks in Sri Lanka reminds me of my happy time spent in the country. Without any doubt, this sad news would heavily impact the local tourism as well. As a tourist in Sri Lanka, my experience was lovely and enjoyable. In fact, I mentioned a few times in my previous posts that Sri Lanka is one of my favorite travel destinations, and I will surely visit it again in future. 

I took this photo at a buddhist temple in a small village of the tea country. People bought fresh flowers from the nearby vendors as offerings. They lit incense sticks and then prayed in front of them. It is my entry to the Emotive Art contest hosted by @ntopaz. 

Here's the photo of original size before cropped by the site:

I once posted another photo from the same place:

斯里兰卡这几天的连环恐怖袭击很让人痛心，肯定也会对当地旅游业造成巨大打击。我不止一次提过它的好，说这是我最喜欢的旅行目的国之一，甚至想过在气候宜人的茶乡长住，将来也一定会再去那里看看。
