This is the enchanting golden hour in Hallerbos of Belgium. Each spring from March to May, you can see this stunning purple-blue forest covered with wild hyacinth flowers.

I was lucky to be gifted with sunny weather that day. When the sun was setting, the warm rays shone through the tall slim birch trees onto the flower carpet of blooming bluebells. The lighting and the color tones combined looked so dreamy. I squated down and shot upwards to the flowers and trees against the sunlight. So here it is, enjoy the beauty! :) 

This is my entry to the Golden Hour Photography hosted by @ntopaz and @tussar11. Thank you!
