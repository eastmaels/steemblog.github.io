Greetings everyone! 👋 In your travels, have you seen unforgettable views from an airplane window? 

The photo here was taken by me when flying from Puerto Montt to Punta Arenas in southern Chile. From the Atacama in the North to the Patagonia in the South, Chile is a fascinating country with so much to offer. 😍 I've shared some pictures and experiences from Atacama and Patagonia before, and this is the first time I post a photo of this region. It's known for its breathtaking volcanoes and  lakes. The view from the sky looks quite spectacular right? This is also my entry for the Photo Friday competition by @qurator.

A loooooooog long time ago, @jenina619 nominated me to do the Getting To Know Each Other / Another 10 Random Questions Challenge (because apparently last year there's a "10 Random Questions Challenge" 🙂). I found it's fun and got to know some Steem friends better after reading their answers. Earlier today I watched the challenge video of @livinguktaiwan, and realized I still haven't joined it! So here it is: 

## 
**1. What supernatural power would you want to have?** 
- Be able to fly and to turn objects edible. 🕊🍗

## 
**2. If you could choose your birth place, where will it be, and why?**
- Mars. They say "Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus", so I'd like to try out a different world. 🚀🌌

## 
**3. If you could go back in time to meet someone from the past, who will it be and why?**
- Leonardo da Vinci. He's a cool combination of scientist and artist. I have to learn some ancient Italian first though. 🔬🎨

##
**4. Which childhood memory is your favorite?**
- Found lots of money notes rolled in a tin can hidden in a tree hole when playing with my cousin. We bought a hill of snacks with that money. 💴🍨

##
**5. What are the three things you notice in the opposite sex first?**
-   eyes, nose and mouth (if we are sitting)
    nosetril, chin and beard (if we are standing)
    hair, hands and shoes (the more sensual movielike ostentatious answer)

##
**6. If Life was a music, what song will yours be playing ?**
- Bobby McFerrin - Don't Worry Be Happy  🎷💃

##
**7. If you were arrested with no explanation, what would your friends and family assume you had done?**
- Ate too much in a restaurant and forgot to bring cash/card/Wechat/Alipay with me. 
   Or some powerful official was offended by my bad joke.  

##
**8. In one sentence, how would you sum up the whaleshares platform?**
- Good marketing if you guys created this challenge. ;) 
   Seriously, I can't even find enough time for this platform, not to say a 2nd one. Anyone who tried it out? I'd love to see your answers!

##
**9. What’s the funniest Wi-Fi name you’ve seen?**
- 123abc

##
**10. What’s something your brain tries to make you do and you have to will yourself not to do it?**
- Sleeping in the morning. 

<br />
