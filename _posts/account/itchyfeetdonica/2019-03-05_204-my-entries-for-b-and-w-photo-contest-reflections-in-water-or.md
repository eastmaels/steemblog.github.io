Hello everyone! Today I'm sharing some photos of reflections in water. The monochrome ones also serve as my entries for the B&W Photo Contest hosted by @daveks. 

## 
The first entry is from the Austrian Alps in the beautiful region of Tyrol. I've loved this area -  you can enjoy  breathtaking views almost everywhere after some easy hikes, and it's normally less crowded and expensive than in similar places of Swiss or French Alps. I took these 2 photos by the lake of Klammsee in the Kaprun ski area. The water of these alpine lakes is usually very clear, so reflections are common sights here. :)

## 
This is an Ascenseur (hydraulic boat lift) located on the Ancien Canal Du Centre near La Louvière of Belgium.  4 lifts with 15+ meters rise were built in the late 19th and early 20th century, and this place has been designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The lifts were used to overcome the difference of the water level (a rise by 66.2 meters) along the canal. You can see all the 4 boat lifts [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat_Lifts_on_the_Canal_du_Centre) if interested. 

This region used to be an important industrial belt in the country, but nowadays commercial traffic bypasses these old lifts and is handled by the huge Strépy-Thieu boat lift, which was the highest in the world upon completion, with a rise of 73 meters. 

I arrived here at sunset and got to see this engineering marvel standing quietly with his reflection in the canal. That sense of past glory! ;)

I shot this photo in the windmill village of Kinderdijk, close to Rotterdam. This place is best known for its 19 iconic windmills built in the first half of 18th century.

I arrived in the afternoon and wandered around till the golden hour. By that time everything was closed and most visitors left, so the windmills and plants were bathing peacefully in warm rays by the waterway. I used to post photos from the same village but from different angles.
