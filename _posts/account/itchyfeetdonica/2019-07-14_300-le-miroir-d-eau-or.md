It was a hot summer day in Bordeaux, France. People were chilling at the big pool on the quay of the Garonne in the city. I passed by and snapped some shots including this one below:

This place is called Le Miroir d'eau (The Water Mirror). It's one of the world's largest reflecting pools, covering 3,450 square metres. These granite slabs are covered by only 2 cm of water, but it's enough for locals as well as visitors to have fun (and splashes) on hot summer days. 

It's My entry for the 🏝 WE LOVE SUMMER 2019 - PHOTO CONTEST 🏝 by @flamingirl. Don't hesitate to join the fun if you also have some summer shots to share! :)
