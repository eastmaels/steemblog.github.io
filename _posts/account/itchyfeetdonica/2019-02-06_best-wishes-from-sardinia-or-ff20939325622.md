Hey my friends! Today is the first day of Chinese Spring Festival. So  Happy New Year to all who celebrate this! 🎉🎈🎊🍗🍗🍗🍲🍛🥘🍤🍤🍤🥂🍾🥢

I’m in Sardinia of Italy and sharing a photo right from yesterday. :) It was close to Alghero at the island's northwestern coast. It's raining, raining and raining most of the time. The dark clouds were hanging low, and the strong waves crushed onto the rocky shores in the crazy heavy wind. Used to the clear tranquil water of the Mediterranean Sea, this turbulent scene was quite unexpected.

大家新年好！🎉🎈

献上来自意大利撒丁岛的汹涌祝福～ 

祝🐷年吃饱睡好没烦恼！

## Chinese New Year and Spring Festival

##
In China, most working people will have a week holiday around the New Year, starting from New Year's Eve or a bit earlier. This holiday is normally called Golden Week Holiday of Spring Festival. Just like the Christmas holiday for westerners, Spring Festival is of great importance for Chinese family reunions.

So why does the 2019 Chinese New Year land on February 5th instead of January 1st? It is because the Spring Festival in China is based on the lunar calendar, which is decided by the monthly cycles of the Moon's phases, also known as synodic months. As a result, the Chinese New Year has no exact date each year, but it mostly falls on a day in January or February in Gregorian calendar, roughly the same dates of Aquarius sign in the Western Zodiac.

Actually, there's also a Chinese Valentine's Day(Qixi/Qiqiao Festival) originated from a beautiful romantic legend, which falls on the 7th day of the 7th month on the Chinese lunar calendar, so it's usually some day in July or August in Gregorian Calendar.

And a fun fact: my birthday is February 7th, which always fell somewhere close to the Chinese New Year. :)

As you may know, 2019 is the year of Pig. If you are interested in the Chinese Zodiac culture, check out [this post](https://steemit.com/citystory/@itchyfeetdonica/49-a-city-a-story-photo-weekly-contest-14-chinese-new-year-zodiac-animals-workshop) I did last year. =)

Last year I was in Australia during the Spring Festival, also by the sea. Here are the greeting cards I made from the photo I took of The Twelve Apostles:

想起去年此时在澳洲过春节，也是在海边，拍了大洋路上有名的12门徒岩(其实只剩8个;p)做成贺卡：
