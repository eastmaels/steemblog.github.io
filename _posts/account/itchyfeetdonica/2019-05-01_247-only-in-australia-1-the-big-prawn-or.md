Thanks to the mention by the very talented photographer @lightcaptured, I got to know his 4th #TravelPhotoContest themed Landmarks. So the first thing popping up in my mind is not the super famous landmarks I’ve visited like Great Wall, Machu Picchu, Christ the Redeemer, Eiffel Tower, Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Statue of Liberty, Sydney Opera House, or Moai on the Easter Island🗿(I know, I’m such a typical tourist right? ;p It’s a great idea for a series of Landmark posts though, so I’m listing them here for future ;)), but a huge prawn 🦐 erected in a small town in Australia.

Also, I’m traveling now without access to most of my past camera photos, yet the pictures of this Big Prawn taken with my phone are lying there still (no pun intended). So here they are - a dedication to my lovely memories in Straya 🇦🇺, this amazing country that I will for sure go back one day. :)

The statue is in Ballina, a town located in New South Wales, serving as a gateway to the popular site Byron Bay. Built in 1989 and reopened in 2013 with a makeover, the Big Prawn is another of Australia's iconic big things. There are also Big Pineapple, Big Banana, Big Peach... but I didn’t stop to take decent pictures of them. 

This Big Prawn is situated adjacent to Bunnings Warehouse on River Street and have attracted road trippers like us.
