Greetings everyone! Recently @sndbox kicked off their #cryptodots challenge - to create your favorite crypto currency logo. And the topic this week is - [Connecting the Dots](https://steemit.com/art/@sndbox/connect-the-dots-earn-crypto-by-drawing-your-favorite-crypto-week-1).


<div class="pull-left">Steemians are tasked to download a dot grid (see the last image) and to illustrate a crypto logo they like. Without any doubt, my favorite crypto at the moment is Steem, :D but since I did a sketch of it (on the right) already in my self-introduction post, now I'd love to try something different. I've always loved the clean and geometric design of Nebulas coin's logo, so I'm recreating it in this challenge. </a></p>

As you can see from my drawing in the head image, the logo of Nebulas is formed in sharp black lines. I am fond of its concept of two intersecting platforms. Have you spotted that at first glance? For the purpose of connecting dots, I turned the whole logo in 45 degrees when making it. So tilt your head a bit when you look! ;)

Do you like my entry? Please tell me what you think in the comments below!

Here is a brief introduction of the crypto -Nebulas from their [website](https://nebulas.io/). Its website design is also one of my favorites among all the sites of cryptocurrencies I know of.

> Nebulas is a next generation public blockchain, aiming for a continuously improving ecosystem.

> Based on its blockchain valuation mechanism, Nebulas proposes future-oriented incentive and consensus systems, and the ability to self-evolve without forking.

I believe this fun challenge is an awesome way to combine art and the crypto world, and to effectively engage the Steemit community. So if you are interested too, don't hesitate to check out @sndbox's page and join the fun! =)

大家好！这是我参加Sndbox举办的“连接点”画加密货币图标的活动。我画的是Nebulas的logo，因为比较喜欢它简洁的几何黑白设计。

为了更好地连接那些点，我在画图的时候，把原logo倾斜了45度角，所以你在看的时候记得也把头或屏幕转一下~ 哈哈。你觉得我改造的这个图标怎么样？欢迎留言评论。: )  

如果你也喜欢涂涂画画，记得去参加这个有意思的活动哦！只要选择任意一种加密币的图标，用连接点的方式画出来就可以啦。一起来玩吧！
