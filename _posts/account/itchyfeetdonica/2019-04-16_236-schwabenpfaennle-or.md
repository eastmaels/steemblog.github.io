I had a delicious meal in a local specialty restaurant in Überlingen, a German city on the northern shore of Lake Constance. 

It's called Schwabenpfännle (the fourth choice on their menu below) - grilled pork fillets with mushroom sauce, spätzle and lettuce salad. Although the yellow egg noodles (Spätzle) themselves didn't have much taste, they soaked the rich mushroom and meat gravy to offer very satisfying bites.

Except for southern Germany and Austria, Spätzle is also found in the cuisines of Switzerland, Hungary, Alsace, Moselle and South Tyrol. Literally meaning "little sparrows" in German, it is a kind of pasta made with fresh eggs. Spätzle doesn't only accompany meat dishes, but also act as a primary ingredient in other types of food. For instance, I tried Spätzle in soup when traveling in Hungary and ate it sweet with sugar and cinnamon in Alsace.

It's also my entry to Qurator's Tasty Tuesday competition and Photocircle's 11th PC-Food photo contest. If you love food and photgraphy, check out these contests and join the fun! 

Have you tried Schwabenpfännle or Spätzle before? Do you like them? :)
