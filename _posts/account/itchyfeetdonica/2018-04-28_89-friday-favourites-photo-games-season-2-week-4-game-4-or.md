## RULES & HOW TO PLAY

 
##

<div class="pull-left">https://steemitimages.com/DQmSTdPy5k2uC9uY1E4E69oTP5KEGb4D1rgXBTAB1GhLdMW/9.jpg</div> Hey photo gamers, now it's weekend, let's play something simple! Since you are here, you might be a photography enthusiast. So have you watched fellow photographers working and taken photos of them? Be it a professional one working in a studio or outdoors, an amateur roaming on the streets looking for a photo opportunity, or just anyone who was taking a selfie or shooting his/her families with a phone? 

## 
I love documenting the "decisive moments" and telling a story with that captured scene. Below are some of my own photos of photographers for your inspiration. It doesn't have to include the whole body of the photographer - the last two examples are more like "photo within a photo" shots.  

Now it's your turn to get creative and show me your favourite photo of a photographer at work. Share the little moment you captured with us, and tell us the story and your experience, and why you like the shot.

## 
1. Just attach your photo and story as a comment here.
2. Only 1 entry per person.
3. For this game you have 2 days to play (till Sunday at 6PM EST / 11PM UTC).

这些照片是我平时旅途中拍的各色摄影人，有正在工作的专业摄影师，也有和你我一样只是随手记录下生活中点滴瞬间的人。你只要在留言里发一张你拍的摄影人的照片，加上对当时发生的故事的描述，以及你为什么喜欢自己拍的这张照片。赶快来参加哦~
