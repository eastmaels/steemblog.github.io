Have you seen some interesting or inspiring prints in your daily life or travels? I'd love to share a few I noticed in this post and the coming ones. So this mug is the first carrier in my series. The photo is also my entry to @ntopaz's Still Life Bodegon contest by @acostaeladio. What do you think of the prints on the mug? :) Unleash your creativity and join the Bodegon fun! 

## 
The definition of Bodegón from their page: 

>Bodegon, a still life photograph, is an artistic composition of several inanimate objects. Still life photographs can be represented with immobile natural materials, such as flowers, seeds, fruits and shells. Or use everyday elements made by man, such as kitchen utensils, work tools or ornaments, which is creating a boom among photographers. Crayons, pencils, paints and 3D objects can be used to create good artistic drawings manually. The design software is also used as an artistic tool to create a good still life.

## 
>Mention the model of the camera or technique for the manual production or design process (include the step-by-step process).

I got this cool mug from a strartup incubator, and I took this photo during my coffee break at work. Here’s the info of the camera and settings:

你在日常生活或旅途中有没有留意到有创意有趣味的神文案？今天开始我就来陆续分享一些这样的例子，比如这张照片里我咖啡杯上的文案。

学过英文的朋友应该很容易就能理解这里"hot"的双关含义：既表示咖啡的热度，又表示初创公司的性感热辣度。我觉得这是很妙的一句话，你认为呢？欢迎留言跟大家分享你的例子，有兴趣的朋友也可以参加@ntopaz的静物摄影活动哦，还有一周截止。
