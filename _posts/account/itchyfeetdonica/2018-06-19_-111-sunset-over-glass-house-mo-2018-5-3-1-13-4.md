Hey fellow Steemians, have you heard of Glass House Mountains in Queensland, Australia?  What you see in the head image is the splendid sunset over this area. Now follow my post for more sunset shots from here and the story behind these mountains! =)

大家好！今天请跟我来看看澳大利亚昆士兰州的玻璃屋群山。日落时分，空中的云朵仿佛被老天打翻的调色盘染上了色彩，绮丽缤纷，我当时看到立刻掏出手机来了一张，于是便有了题图。

## 
I first noticed these peaks on the way from Brisbane to Sunshine Coast. The landscape outside was dominantly coastal plains covered with green trees and plants, then out of a sudden, a few rugged peaks rose abruptly from nowhere. Hmmm, interesting. I immediately checked the map on my phone to see what they are. So these are Glass House Mountains - 13 dramatic peaks formed by volcanic activity that occurred 26 to 27 million years ago.

The highest hill is called Mount Beerwah, sitting at 556 metres above sea level. It is seen as the mother hill, and Mount Tibrogargan is the father of the left 11 peaks. Among the son and daughter hills, the eldest brother is Mount Coonowrin.  How lovely - it is a big family of hills! :D

See some spiritual connection here? Yes, the traditional owners of this area are the Aboriginals - Jinibara and Gubbi Gubbi people. They used to gather in their spiritual home here for ceremonies and trading, and many of their ceremonial sites are still present today. Due to their cultural significance, the Glass House Mountains are listed on the Queensland and National heritage registers as a landscape of national importance.

After exploring the whole region of the Sunny Coast, we moved to this cooler and greener hinterland. I feel so lucky to have this spectacular view almost daily on the way to work and back. I never get tired of it. It's not just a feast of endless green landscape to the eyes, but also the feeling of spirituality to the mind. It is kind of magical. =) Especially when the sun is setting, the vast land appears more mysterious against all the brilliant colors of the sky. 

You might wonder if you can get close to this big family of hills? Yes, three of them are open to the public for bushwalking and climbing: the mother Mount Beerwah, the father Mount Tibrogargan and one of their children - Mount Ngungun. :) Hiking on the easy or challenging walking tracks through open forests is rewarding when you end up at the lookouts offering amazing panoramic views.

We also love driving along the 55-kilometre Blackall Range Tourist Drive, just north of the Glass House Mountains. This is such a scenic drive on the winding country roads. Imagine the fresh mountain air, and the views all the way back to the beaches on the coast! ❤

If you want to get more active, try rock climbing, kayaking or horse-riding. Or even more adventurous, have yourself abseiling a 50-metre drop - feel the heartbeat of yourself and the heartbeat from this wild land!

Catching a train ride is always fun too! The historic rail network in this area has stations dating back to the 1890s, and the tracks were first laid for transporting timber. The steam trains are now replaced by modern ones though. 

You can pick up a map at the Glass House Mountains Visitor and Interpretive Centre, where you can learn about attractions and their history, and buy local products such as honey and jam. The hinterland region is home to farms growing pineapples, strawberries, avocados and macadamias. There are stalls selling fresh produce along the roads. Like in the black forest of Germany, you only need to leave coins in "honesty boxes" for your purchase.

So that's it for today, hope you like the sunset views and the story behind these mountains? Come visit this beautiful hinterland when you get a chance! You will love it!  :)
