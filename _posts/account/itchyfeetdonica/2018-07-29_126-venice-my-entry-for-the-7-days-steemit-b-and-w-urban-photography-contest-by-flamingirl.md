Hey fellow Steemians! Hope you had a great weekend? Today I'm sharing 2 photos I took in the famous water town -- Venice of Italy at golden hour. The black-and-white image is my entry for the 7 DAYS STEEMIT B&W URBAN PHOTOGRAPHY CONTEST by @flamingirl. 

The picture was clicked from the grand canal, with a view of the Cathedral of Santa Maria della Salute. The canal area was full of life with constant hustle and bustle. But all these turned into a peaceful scene when the setting sun started to cast a warm spell over everything. I loved watching all the boats and gondolas swaying in the water, passing by those wonderful architectures at the shore. 

In the colored photo, you can see the orange-hued domes and buildings, against the pinkish sky and by the blueish water; while in the monochrome one, the structure and lines of the buildings & boats, as well as the contrast of the shades & shapes are more prominent. Which one do you prefer? Tell me what you think in the comments below!  =)

大家好！今天分享的照片是我在意大利的水城威尼斯拍摄的。

夕阳的金辉中，圆顶的安康圣母教堂，携着高高低低的楼房，静静矗立在运河边，和我一起望着水中来来往往的船只。橙黄色调的巴洛克杰作，错落在粉蓝的天空下，倚着那藏青的一湾流水，画面太美，我不敢不拍。

而当这一切转变为黑白，建筑的结构和线条、层次的对比、明暗的变化，都更加清晰起来。


你更喜欢彩色的还是单色的呢？欢迎留言分享~  : )

There's plagiarism in the past contests, so as required by the hostess, here's the proof of my camera settings and a photo of me by the canal:

因为曾有剽窃他人摄影作品的行为，应主办人要求，下面是我的相机设置和在场证明~~摆拍太明显^^~~：
