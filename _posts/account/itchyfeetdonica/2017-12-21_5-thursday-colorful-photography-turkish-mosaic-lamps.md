Hey Steemians,

Happy Thursday! Here is my entry for the  #Colorfulphotography challenge hosted by @juliank. 

I took this photo on a street of Istanbul. In Turkey, these colorful mosaic lamps can be found in street shops, bazaars, restaurants, local homes... and are getting more and more popular in countries outside of Turkey.  I've seen them in the restaurants in Europe, Asia, Latin America...and some people like to integrate these exotic oriental lamps with their home decor. 

这张照片是我在伊斯坦布尔街头拍的。土耳其的街头小店，巴扎，食肆，宾馆，当地人家...... 随处可见这种色彩绚丽的马赛克玻璃灯。用这种灯作为装饰照明在其他国家也日渐流行开来。我就在欧洲亚洲拉美等不少国家的饭店里看到过这种灯饰，还有一些朋友喜欢将这些充满东方风情的灯饰用于家装以增添异国情调。

As you can see from the photo, Turkish mosaic lamps are made of colored and geometrical shaped glass pieces. These glasses are grouped to form different design patterns. In the center of most patterns, you see hexagram(star of David),  a popular shape on Islamic and Arabic artifacts and mosques. The essential glass making techniques were perfected in the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire. 

While another trendy deco style - Moroccan lighting which takes their roots from Moorish and Moroccan cultures, is often confused with Turkish lamps. At first I also made the mistake thinking these lamps and Turkish lamps are from the same region, like some online shops titled Moroccan lamps but are actually selling Turkish lamps, vice versa. But, in fact, Moroccan lamps are mainly made of perforated metal, although they also come with exquisite design in geometrical forms.

如照片所示，土耳其马赛克灯罩上的几何图案是由彩色几何形状的碎片玻璃拼接成的。在这些设计里常常会有六角星，这种广泛用于伊斯兰和阿拉伯建筑及艺术品的图案。玻璃制造工艺在拜占庭和奥斯曼帝国时期达到顶峰。

还有另一种潮流灯饰则来自摩洛哥和摩尔文化。这些摩洛哥灯常常被和土耳其灯混为一谈，我在去土耳其旅行前也没太注意两种灯的区别，以为它们都来自同一地区。我还看到有些网店标题说卖土耳其灯饰，结果点进去一看其实是摩洛哥灯。摩洛哥灯虽然也有精美复杂的几何图案设计，但一般是由金属制成，镂空的图案和光影墙体相结合，创造出美妙的视觉效果。
