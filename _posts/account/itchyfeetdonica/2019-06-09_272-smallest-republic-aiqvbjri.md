The Partiko Cityscape Photography Contest and @axeman's amazing shots of the Lithuanian coast remind me of my trip to Lithuania many years ago. I've visited almost all EU countries, among which the Baltic states are the first few ones. I guess I'm kind of weird, as most people would first go to places like Paris and Rome when they visit Europe. But I found these Baltic countries pretty enchanting.    

In this post I'd love to share with you some information about Užupis, one of the world's smallest republics in the middle of the Lithuanian capital. The Republic of Užupis only covers less than 1 square km within Vilnius, but it has its own president, constitution, bishop and even two churches.

The guide of the walk tour told us Užupis means "behind the river" in Lithuanian. You can see a bit of "the river" Vilnelė in my photo here ;). Used to be the city's poorest and roughest area during the former Soviet Union time, this unique republic now attracts more and more visitors. 

Like in many art districts of the big cities around the world, artists came first for the cheap accommodation, and eventually transformed the neighborhoods into a vibrant creative community. Nowadays, it hosts various events like exhibitions, concerts, fashion festivals and poetry evenings.

This is my entry to the cityscape (or countryscape in this case? ;p) photo contest, posted with @partiko on my phone, and I'll share more photos and info about this artistic republic in my coming post. So stay tuned and see you soon!
