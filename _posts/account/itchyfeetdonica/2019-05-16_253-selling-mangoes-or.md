Hey everyone! Here's a photo I shot when traveling in Ethiopia. I shared a car with another female solo traveller met in an agency in the capital city, and on our way to the south, this local girl approached us to sell mangoes. These huge fruits were just harvested and tasted very sweet and juicy.   

It's my entry to the Steemit Portrait Photography Contest Week 83 themed "Travel". I'd like to say thank you to @portraitcontest who hosts this long-term contest and to @lightcaptured who suggested the theme.(I love this theme! :D) @lightcaptured also hosts a travel photo contest with a different theme each time. SO if you are into portrait/travel photography too, feel free to join these fun contests! :)

这是我在去埃塞俄比亚南部途中遇到的卖芒果的小女孩，刚就近采摘的芒果又大又甜，在炎热的天气里很解渴。
