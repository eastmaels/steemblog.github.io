When I travel to or live in a new place, it's always been a pleasure for me to discover the local folk music. I've long enjoyed Caribbean music, and I got to know a bit more about it when living in Puerto Rico. This photo on the left was taken at a port of Havana when I visited Cuba. The elderly man was singing a folk song in Spanish while playing his guitar. The beautiful Caribbean melody and his contagious smile reminds me of Harry Belafonte's "Jamaica Farewell". I first heard this song on the car radio in a road trip, and it's been on my playlist ever since. 
 
Sold as calypso, this old Jamaican mento song is a classic hit in the 1950s and is widely covered. Besides the delightful rhythms and Harry Belafonte’s fabulous voice, I like the vivid description in its lyrics, and how it deals with the farewell. It brings me back to the many trips of my own - there’s always something from the destination that impressed you, although you are reluctant to say goodbye, the great memories will stay with you for the rest of your life journey. It’s not necessarily "a little girl" or a charming old guy, it can be the natural beauties, the architectural marvels, a new sport/game/dance/drink never tried before, a misadventure, an inspiring story, newly made friends, exotic ingredients and crafts in the markets, or a tasty national dish like "ackee and saltfish"... :D

> #### Harry Belafonte - Jamaica Farewell

## 
>Down the way where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop

>But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

>Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls sway to and fro
I must declare my heart is there
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico

>Down at the market you can hear
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
'Akey' rice, salt fish are nice
And the rum is fine any time of year

## RULES & HOW TO PLAY
 
For _**MUSIC MATCH MONDAY**_ we would like you to share a piece of music (can be written lyrics or a link to a sound file or music video) **AS WELL AS** your own photo (or artwork) to go along with that music. We want to see how music inspires your art.

We will be judging your entries based on how your photo “matches” or fits the music that you chose, not on the technical quality of the photo. Try to convince us: feel free to write a description or story telling us how the photo or artwork relates to the song in your mind.

1. Share your music and photo in the comments of the Photo Star’s post.
2. Only *one* entry per person on each Photo Star's post.
3. Each Photo Star will choose their winner.
