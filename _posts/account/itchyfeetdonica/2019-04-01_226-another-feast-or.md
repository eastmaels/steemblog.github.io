What's up fellow Steemians! Here I'm sharing some food photos I took in one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Belgium. Since it's not a big country with many genuine Chinese restaurants, it's not difficult for a foodie like me to try out almost all of them. :) This wonderful place surely stands out. I have been there quite a lot of times and went there again today. I introduced it in [my previous post](https://steemit.com/tasteem/@itchyfeetdonica/tasteem-7834f7) if you are interested to know more.   

It is also my entry post for @qurator's Tasty Tuesday competition, as well as the PC-Food photo contest hosted by @photocircle. Do you love food and photography too? Have a look at these fun challenges and join in! =)
