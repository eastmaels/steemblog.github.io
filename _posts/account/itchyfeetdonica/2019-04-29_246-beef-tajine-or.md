This is the beef Tajine I had yesterday in Morocco. The dried apricots and prunes added a sweet taste to it, and they were a perfect match to the soft succulent beef. Scoop up the rich tasty gravy with the bread aside - it’s simply heaven! :)

Tajine is a popular dish primarily prepared in the Middle East and North Africa. It’s named after the shallow earthen pot in which it is cooked. In North Africa it is called a Tajine/Tagine, while in the Middle East it is called a maraq (meaning broth) or a qidra (the cooking pot).

As there are quite a lot of Moroccan immigrants in Belgium, restaurants that serve Tajine can also be found there. I tried beef and chicken Tajine before a few times, but it’s my first time in Morocco. They have always been such a hearty delight to enjoy. =)

Beautiful decorative pots I found on the street:

What about you? Have you tried Tajine? Do you like it? 

It’s my entry to @qurator’s Tasty Tuesday competition. Join the fun too if you like food and photography!

这是昨天在摩洛哥北部小城得土安吃的塔吉锅。牛肉松软鲜嫩，白芝麻的香气在空中飘散，杏仁和西梅干的丝丝甜味融入别样的阿拉伯风情，用面包蘸点浓浓的汤汁，吃到嘴里回味无穷。^^

塔吉锅是北非中东比较普遍的主食，名字来源于烹饪的容器，在中东称呼有所不同。因为比利时有不少摩洛哥移民，以前也吃过几次鸡肉和牛肉塔吉锅，在本土还是第一次尝试。

这次上菜时没有像有些餐馆一样，把那标志性的尖尖的锅盖（上图有我街拍的容器）也一起端上来，然后服务生充满仪式感地揭开锅盖放在旁边，让你在蒸腾上升的热气中咽着口水，从一片朦胧中张望那盘诱人的美食。:)
