I visited Valparaíso, the charming port city on Chile’s coast when living in the country's capital Santiago. It's a bit over 1 hour by car from Santiago, and there are plenty of public buses connecting the 2 cities as well. 

Valparaíso boasts colorful houses along the hills and even more coloful graffiti all over the house walls. :) It's called Chile's Cultural Capital due to its booming art and culture scene. It's great fun to take the steep funiculars to those hilltops, where you can visit the abundant beautiful architectures and artsy shops. Along your ride, you also get fantastic views of the buildings, the hills, the port and the vast Pacific ocean.

瓦尔帕莱索是个多姿多彩、很有味道的嬉皮小城，被称为智利的“文化之都”。位于智利首都圣地亚哥以西的太平洋沿岸，从首都出发的话，自驾一个小时多一点，坐大巴近两个小时。这里跟大家分享的是我坐缆车上山后俯瞰到的港口景色。

In this post, I'm showing you the views of the port I got after ascending to high up by a funicular. Valparaíso's port is divided into ten sites, and the last two include a dock and are used as public walks and cruise passenger terminal. As a main container and passenger port in the country, it transfers 10 million tons each year, and serves about 50 cruises. 

The city's port received a large number of immigrants, primarily from Europe from 1848 till 1914. As a result, neighbourhoods of different styles were built on Valparaíso's hillsides. Among these Historic Districts, the most prominant ones are legacies by the British, Germans, and Italians.  Nowadays, they are preserved as "Zonas Típicas".
