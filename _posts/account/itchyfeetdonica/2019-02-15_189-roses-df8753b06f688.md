Red roses are a widely known symbol of love, passion and courage, so they are popular gifts for Valentine's Day, like the ones I got here. This is my entry for the VALENTINE'S DAY PHOTO CONTEST 2019 by @flamingirl. I post 3 photos from different angles as proof that they are my photoworks. More details can be provided if necessary.

Here's a bit history and legend about roses. Earliest roses are known to have grown 35 million-years ago, and from ancient Egyptian tombs, petrified rose wreaths have been unearthed.

In Greek mythology, Aphrodite, Goddess of Love, is said to have created the rose. According to the poet Anacreon, sea foam dripping from her newborn body turned into white roses; thus symbolizing her innocence and purity. Later, her wounded lover Adonis' blood was shed onto a white rose, and the red rose represented her desire and passion.

The Romans, with their counterpart Goddess of Love - Venus, also adopted the rose as a symbol of love and beauty. Cupid offered a rose to bribe the God of Silence to hush his mother Venus's affairs. And when he shot arrows at bees which had stung him, thorns grew from the rose stems where the bees were missed.

There's even The War of the Roses. In this civil war in England in the 15th century, the House of York adopted a white rose, while the House of Lancaster chose a red rose. At last, the winner - Tudor Henry VII created the Tudor Rose by merging his Lancastrian rose with the red rose of his York bride. This Rose is also known as the Rose of England.

张爱玲奶奶70多年前在她的小说《红玫瑰与白玫瑰》中留下了这段名言：

>也许每一个男子全都有过这样的两个女人，至少两个。娶了红玫瑰，久而久之，红的变了墙上的一抹蚊子血，白的还是“床前明月光”。娶了白玫瑰，白的便是衣服上沾的一粒饭黏子，红的却是心口上一颗朱砂痣。

小说里，热烈的红玫瑰最终转变为贤慧的他人妻，圣洁的白玫瑰却苍凉地失去了自我。哪个更好？哪个更合适？何止婚姻是围城，这世上又有什么重大决定不是呢？
