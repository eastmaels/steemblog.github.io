What's up fellow Steemians! In this post I'm going to share some Christmas trees I've seen in different parts of our lovely planet. The head image here is my entry for the CHRISTMAS-STEEM PHOTO CONTEST 2018 by @flamingirl. She is a devoted Steemian who posts daily and hosts photo contests regularly. Check out her page and join the Christmas photo fun! =)

I took these two photos during the Christmas time 2 years ago in Ecuador. I was travelling solo through South America then from Colombia all the way down to Chile. So I got to experience the holiday in the Southern Hemisphere, and I shared some pictures on Steemit last Christmas - [Be Creative - 10 Alternative Christmas Trees for Your Inspiration ](https://steemit.com/art/@itchyfeetdonica/be-creative-alternative-christmas-trees-for-your-inspiration). 


It did feel very unique in some hotter places, while in these 2 photos, it was in the Andean mountains in central Ecuador, so it's still pretty cold. The local women in traditional clothing were decorating the Christmas tree at the center of their small village. I happened to walk by and captured this scene. 

What do you think of this shot? Do you find it interesting as I did? :)

各位节日快乐~！两年前的圣诞期间，我在厄瓜多尔中部山区看到几位当地人在装饰圣诞树，觉得挺有意思，就拍下了这两张照片。用来参加@flamingirl的圣诞主题摄影活动，一起来玩吧！

当时我只身一人，两条腿加个小包，从南美洲北边的哥伦比亚一路南下晃荡到智利，见到了不少南半球圣诞新年的独特场景，去年圣诞节时已经在这里发了一些 (比如[开脑洞：别样圣诞树影集](https://steemit.com/art/@itchyfeetdonica/be-creative-alternative-christmas-trees-for-your-inspiration)，见下图)，接下来的帖子里会继续分享。=)
