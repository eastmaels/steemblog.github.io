_I was just trying out uploading the same image from different frontends to compare, since the photo was clearly compressed today. So I suggest that you view the picture on other frontends or apps such as Steempeak, busy.org, esteem, partiko..._

_P.S. 刚发现今天通过steemitimages上传的图片突然被疯狂压缩，画质大大受损，建议使用其他前端或app来浏览图片。_

This is a moment I captured in front of the Central Market in Cambodia's capital city, Phnom Penh. The large market constructed in 1937 was in the shape of a dome with four arms, and it's a busy place full of visitors. 

After I tried some great local food at one of the street stands outside, I walked towards this indoor market. At the entrance, I saw these 4 boys having fun with a phone, and I quickly took out my phone to freeze this scene. To them, all the hustle and bustle didn't seem to exist. The little joys of life~ :)

这是我在柬埔寨首都金边的中心市场前抓拍的一幕。这个建于1937年的老市场被大圆顶覆盖，来逛吃买东西的人络绎不绝。市场前面还有很多小吃摊点，很多当地人和游客都在此大快朵颐。

我也在这里大吃了一顿，然后就往中心市场室内走，在门口看到这几个小男孩。他们全神贯注地盯着那只小手机，任由面前人群熙攘，车水马龙。我觉得挺有意思，就掏出小手机，“咔嚓”下了这个瞬间~。 : )
