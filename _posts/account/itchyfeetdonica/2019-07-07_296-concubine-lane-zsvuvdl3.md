Have you heard of Concubine Lane? A unique name right? It's a lane in the old town of Ipoh, Malaysia.

Another 2 lanes nearby are called the Wife Lane and the First Concubine Lane. It's said that after a fire in Ipoh Old Town in 1892, the mining tycoon Yao Tet Shin gave away the rebuilt houses on these lanes to his 3 wives. That's how the 3 lanes got their names from the locals. Another legend has it that concubines of some wealthy men lived in these lanes. 

I have no idea where the concubines are nowadays,  and this lane has been transformed into a lively place full of shops selling crafts, snacks and drinks. I took this picture with my phone when being caught in a sudden tropical shower there.
