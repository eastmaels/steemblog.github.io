Inspired by @kus-knee’s Show Me a Sign contest, I’ve digged out an old picture from my phone and will also present you another sign photo freshly taken in my current trip.

The first picture here was shot in Castro, a city on Chiloé Island in Chile. It’s known for its colorful wooden stilt houses (palafitos) and churches. I loved this quiet and peaceful place that had so many creative and unique architectures to offer. 

This sign is of a Chilean style Cevichería restaurant, and oh how I miss the Peruvian ceviches! I had the fresh delicious treat almost every week when living in Chile ~ Qué rico! :) 

The simple sign adds a playful touch to the traditional wooden house, and its name and the fish indicate the restaurant’s signature dish, the typical element of Chilotan architecture palafitos, and its location right by the Pacific Ocean.

Here’s another sign ( actually 2 if you also count the one behind) I just captured when visiting Chefchaouen. It’s a colorful place as well but much more touristic. It’s in the Rif Mountains of northwest Morocco and is known for the old town’s blue-painted buildings. 

Still some distance from the Sahara Desert, but this lovely sign did match the blue background and successfully caught my attention.

What do you think of these signs? Do you have interesting signs to share? Feel free to join the fun contest too!
