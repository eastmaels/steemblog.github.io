<h2>Project Details</h2>
## 
GDevelop is an open-source, cross-platform game creator. It doesn't require any programming skills, so it's easy to use. 


Anyone can use GDevelop to create 2D games, such as platformers, puzzles, shoot 'em up, strategy, 8-bit games... It can be simple projects for fun or more ambitious indie games. 


Events is a unique feature of GDevelop. It's a powerful way to express the logic of your game without a programming language.


Users can publish games created with GDevelop to the web, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux and even Facebook Messenger. Games can also be exported in one click to Android from the app. 


GDevelop also offers visual editors to prototype new features, and the game engine can be extended with Javascript.


Tutorials, examples and a complete documentation for the software are available. 


As a wonderful opportunity to teach programming and game making, GDevelop has already been used in classrooms and online courses, with digital media students or children in first grade.

## 
This project boasts user-friendly and creative features. I believe it's a great tool that helps people without any programming knowledge turn their ideas into reality. Hopefully my translation in Simplified Chinese would bring more users to this platform. I'd love to see the large number of Chinese makers and educators benefit from this tool. So they can unleash their creativity to build games or programmes, and inspire students to do so as well.

**Translation Overview**


As you can see from the screenshots below, this project consists of 2 files - GDevelop 5 (editor) and GDevelop (core and extensions). In my first contribution, I started from the first file at 0%, and finished 36% (1,054 of 2,906 words). 

Later, more source strings were added to the file making it 4,056 words in total. So this time I first went through the added strings on previous pages and translated them. I also reviewed the earlier translations for the consistency of the second half. 91% of the first file is completed at the time of writing.

The 91% has not been done by me alone though. There were other volunteers translating part of the file. However, they were not translators from our Chinese team qualified by @utopian-io and @davinci.witness. They translated some strings randomly  and some just copied my translations and posted them again. I confirmed with our moderator and went on translating the left part. I also overwrote a few strings' translations when I found them incorrect. 


I appreciate the help from my proofreader @aafeng, who examined my translation work promptly and suggested three changes. I'm looking forward to working on the rest of the two files. 


## 
**Languages**


I translate from English to Simplified Chinese.


##
