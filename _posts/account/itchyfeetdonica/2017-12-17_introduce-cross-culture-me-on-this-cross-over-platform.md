<h2>Greetings</h2>

Hello, fellow Steemians! This is @ItchyfeetDonica! I'm thrilled to be here to start my first post! Thanks to @joythewanderer , I was invited to Steemit earlier when traveling through Asia, and after some crazy busy days, I finally put my procrastination to an end to introduce myself! Let me begin with my Steemit logo sketches and the verification process (Yes I also drew a little kangaroo - I see these cute guys almost every day😁) ：

<h2> Origins</h2>

I was born and raised in China, studied/worked/lived in Asia, Europe, South America and the Caribbean, and now living in Queensland, Australia. Some friends asked me how I managed to survive in all these different languages and cultures? 😅 The secret: Complaint less, appreciate more. Fear less, try more. 


My name is &*^%(you won't recognize it anyway if you don't know Chinese characters😉), so I go by Donica, as it's more definite than using Roman letters to mark the pronunciation of a Chinese name. Since I have been teaching Mandarin to non-native speakers for years, I would like to write a post about this confusion in Chinese names in future. So wait and see if you are interested (Hopefully this is not another excuse for procrastination😆 I'll try to use less emoji's - my facial muscles are getting sore).   

I believe in a future decentralized and connected, including work, energy and...currency. That’s why I travel around to decentralize myself and to connect with the world ;). It's also why I am optimistic about the #blockchain technology: if well regulated, it will disrupt financial services in a good way. I love creative and alternative ways of doing things, so #Steemit seems to be a great place to combine content creation and alternative currency, a cool crossover to help you get the best of both worlds. Yes I just like this ”cross-over” sort of thing, as a product of “cross-culture” myself. :D

<h2> Interests (My Future Topics) </h2>
My educational background includes a Bachelor in language and cross-culture communication and a Master of Cultural Studies, and my working experiences are in marketing communications, interpretation and translation between Mandarin and English, as well as language and inter-culture training. I'm most enthusiastic about traveling, photography, cooking, design, arts, crafts, sustainability, health and wellness. And of course in this ever-changing society you pick up new interests quite fast, such as #cryptocurrency =). It's always exciting to expand the knowledge base and add new experience. 

I've traveled to over 60 countries across 6 continents and the journey continues. I feel exhilarated seeing anything with a map on it. I believe any traveler understands this wanderlust - you just can't have enough. By traveling far and wide, you discover new ways of living and understand other cultures to appreciate them, you constantly get inspired and would ultimately better yourself. Especially when you travel solo, you set yourself free and interact more with locals. You start to judge less and accept more. I have loads of stories to share as a result of the extensive living and traveling in diverse cultures,  and I'd like to do it from cross-culture perspective. 

Just like fellow travelers, I enjoy documenting experiences along the way. I love to catch the decisive moment in a photo, to tell a story with that captured scene, to freeze the timeless beauty in silence. I also tried aerial drone videos, underwater filming,...and have so much to learn. Here are some screenshots from my Instagram: a peek into my passion in travel and photography.

I do, like many of you foodies there, take great pleasure in eating and cooking. And I try to learn cooking from different cultures during my travels, to spice up my own experiments on food fusion. I’d love to share these experiences in my future posts too, such as the fun culinary workshops in Mexico, Peru, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, etc.. 
![Collage6.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmWMZ6kYVe1uVgFeiAHYPmX95y2PcuEgyyb9yytV7LVVHP/Collage6.jpg)


Drawing and painting have been my hobbies since childhood, and I started a T-shirt DIY painting studio and a comic club with my classmate back in university. For my startup work I designed some company branding materials and made amateurish websites and videos. Making crafts brings me immense joy as well. I'd be happy to share my experiences in making silver rings, batiks, etc... I surely have a long way to go as a beginner, and I believe it will be fun learning from all these creatives here on Steemit. Stay hungry, stay foolish. Consume less, create more. 

I will finish my introduction with some gifts made and wrapped by me: Merry Christmas in advance! =) Frown less, smile more!

<h2>To Be Continued</h2>
I can't wait to be part of the Steemit community to share my stories and insights and to learn from you guys! Exchange makes change.

<h2>Chinese version 中文版自我介绍:</h2>

Steemit的朋友们，大家好！

今天终于来写处女贴自我介绍！我在比利时读研时认识了@Joythewanderer, 我俩都爱学语言，都常独自背个小包就出发，跟随当地人的脚步去游荡，还一起上了荷兰语课。后来她留守欧洲，我转战南美，之前谈到Steemit并由她邀请来注册，然后拖延症反复发作一直没来写点什么。我在中国出生长大干活，后来去欧洲留学实习，也在智利，波多黎各工作生活过，现居澳洲。自大学起使用Donica这个名字，周围的中国朋友同事喜欢叫我小多，后来年纪渐长，幼小稚嫩的小多成为成熟机智的老多, 哈哈;p。作为走过6大洲60多国的一枚吃货，有很多跨文化的故事感悟想和大家分享。因为我大学学了点跨文化交际和文化研究，加上语言文化培训，口笔译，市场传播等方面的工作经验和对旅游，摄影，烹饪，设计，绘画，手工等的兴趣，所以我的内容会包括但不限于这些方面，希望能在Steemit这个平台和大家多多交流学习，一起玩乐进步！估计这里的中国还有华人朋友们也大都使用英文，所以有些中文没提到的请看上面的英文和照片。

感谢你们抽空来看我的自我介绍！欢迎各位留言评论，点赞关注。谢谢！:D
