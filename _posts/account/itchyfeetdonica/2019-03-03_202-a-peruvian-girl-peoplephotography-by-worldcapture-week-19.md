How are you doing my Steem friends? Here's my entry for the Peoplephotography by @worldcapture week #19 and Qurator's Photo Friday competition. Check out these contests and join the fun! =)

I captured this photo near Pisac in the Sacred Valley of Peru. I was wandering around and was attracted by this cheerful girl who was walking down the stairs. 

The villages in this region are known for their locally made textiles. I did a post about one textile market in another village some days ago. Check it out if interested. 

Didn't she look pretty in these traditional outfits? I showed her the picture and we were both happy about it. :) 

I also made a black & white one like what is popular in street photography, but I prefer the first one that shows her colorful clothing. What do you think? Tell me in the commnets please!

嗨~ 这是我在秘鲁神圣山谷里一处古迹Pisac的附近抓拍的一个当地小女孩。这块地区的手工织物很有名，我前些天写过一篇另一个村子里的植物染色的布料市场，有兴趣的小伙伴可以看看。

很多街拍人像流行用黑白色调，但我觉得这原本的颜色更能表现她们当地多彩的传统服装。你觉得呢？
