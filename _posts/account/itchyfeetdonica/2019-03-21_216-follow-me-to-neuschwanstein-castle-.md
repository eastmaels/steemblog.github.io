What's up fellow Steemians! You might have heard of Neuschwanstein Castle, which inspired Sleeping Beauty’s castle in Disneyland? So follow me today to visit this famous palace nestled in the idyllic Bavarian Alps! :)

大家好呀~ 你们听过德国的网红新天鹅堡吧？没错，就是迪士尼乐园里睡美人城堡的原型！据说也启发了1950年建成的灰姑娘城堡。今天就请跟我到巴伐利亚州，一路上山来看看这个梦幻城堡和它周围让人惊艳的自然环境。 

##
As you can see from the map of my phone, the castle is located on a hill above the village of Hohenschwangau near Füssen in the southwest of Germany. Most visitors start the trip from Hohenschwangau where the ticket center is located.

The route map I found on a road sign:

Some easy walking at the beginning:

En route I got this view of the castle - Hohenschwangau perched on a little hill, and the brilliant sunset. This older castle was where King Ludwig II spent his childhood, and it had been overshadowed by the shing new castle ever since its completion.

Actually Neuschwanstein Castle was originally called New Hohenschwangau Castle, and it's given a new name after Ludwig II’s death. Literally meaning "New Swan Stone Castle", it is a reference to the influential and controversial composer Richard Wagner’s character, the Swan Night. 

King Ludwig II of Bavaria commissioned the castle as a retreat on a rugged cliff in 1868, 2 years after he lost his powers as a result of the Austro-Prussian War. However, he never saw the final Neuschwanstein castle. The last  towers were only finished 6 years after his sudden death in 1886. 

After this charming Romanesque Revival palace was opened to the public, it quickly became one of the most visited castles in the world. Its white limestone façade and blue turrets are said to be real-life inspiration for the Disney Cinderella castle as well.

Pictures and commentaries on my way - the castle seen from the west and the northwest:

Below is the view I captured from the very high Marienbrücke" (Mary's bridge), situated above Pöllat gorge. What impressed me the most was not the Neuschwanstein Castle itself, but rather how it blended into the stunning natural settings around. 

I visited it in September when the surrounding foliage just started to turn yellow, while green was still the dominant color. Judging from the photos I saw taken in other seasons, this place is amazingly beautiful all year round. I'd love to visit it in future in other times of the year and to do more hikings in the forests nearby.

After crossing the bridge, I found a narrow trail leading high up. Thinking that it would be a great vantage point for photos, I decided to hike along:

The trail was almost blocked at the end, and I had to climb with my hands at the last part. But it's a lot of fun to explore, and it's rewarding to see the panoramic view in the golden hour. :)

The head image in this post was taken from the same vantage point, and it's my entry to @qurator's Photo Friday competition.
