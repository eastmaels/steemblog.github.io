Hey fellow Steemians, how's your weekend going? Today I would love to share with you some "framed" photos from my travels, inspired by the photo fun challenge by @claudiaz. 

今天来和大家分享几张旅途中拍摄的自带边框的照片。

<center><h2>Casa dos Contos - Ouro Preto, Brazil</h2> </center>

![DA8A4F66-ECDB-44DF-86E2-7C8CF335D3E5.jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSYuZcMocabmWv5JZyb5LtmWSh9ExbsTgab8aDgc2pUWQ/DA8A4F66-ECDB-44DF-86E2-7C8CF335D3E5.jpeg)

I took this first photo with my phone in Casa dos Contos (House of Tales), a museum in the charming colonial town Ouro Preto in Brazil. The window framed the beautiful street view outside, making it an interesting shot for me. Casa dos Contos is centrally located in Ouro Preto, by the historic Tiradentes Square filled with fine Baroque colonial architectures. 

When I entered it on a gloomy day, the only other visitors were a group of school kids lead by a teacher. But apparently those pupils were not so interested in the exhibition, as they were taking selfies all the time with their phones. ;) I will share this funny scene one day in my future post. According to the pictures displayed inside the museum, this huge historic building used to house the elite, the troops, the prisoners and others in different periods of history. It was restored and turned to a museum in 1983, and it's free to enter. Now it's displaying documentary exhibits about the Mint and the Central Bank of Brazil, as well as other cultural presentations such as furniture, documents and books from the 18th and 19th centuries. 

I found this beautiful old building a hidden gem, just like the city of Ouro Preto, which was the most populous city in the New World in the 18th century because of the gold rush. Ouro Preto was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980 and is well-known in Brazil, but a bit off the radar and path of foreign tourists. Most visitors here were Brazilians, or Spanish speakers from the same continent who could understand a lot Portuguese. So very few locals speak English or Spanish, and I was struggling to get by with my crappy Spanish, which was a fun experience for me!  :D

第一张照片是在巴西小城Ouro Preto市中心的一个博物馆向窗外拍到的街景。我所在的这座殖民风格的老楼有着多姿多彩的过去：在历史上的不同时期曾经是名流聚会之地、军队指挥官指点江山的场所、关押犯人的监狱......1983年的时候被改建成博物馆，名字的意思是“有故事的房子”，展出18到19世纪的家具、书籍、照片、货币等饱经沧桑的历史物件。从我的照片上可以看到，窗外那些建于殖民地时期的巴洛克风格的房子和教堂在阴雨中也是别有一番风味。

Ouro Preto在葡萄牙语里的意思是“黑金城”，因为这里是殖民时期的淘金重镇，18世纪时，就有800多吨黑金被从这里运往宗主国葡萄牙。就像南美很多因采矿而发迹的小城一样，黑金城一度成为18世纪整个新世界人口最多的地方，连彼时的纽约人口也只有它的一半。如今虽然不再有黑色的金子可淘，却因出产色彩斑斓的宝石而著称, 是帝王玉的原产地。

这里的殖民建筑保存得也很完整，1980年成为巴西第一个被列为世界文化遗产的古镇。在巴西国内名气挺大，但是外国游客不是很多，我去博物馆的当天，只在里面见到一个由当地老师带领的小学生团，而那些小学生们显然并没有对展览很感兴趣，而是都在忙着用手机各种自拍，有机会我会发发这些孩子的照片，实在让人忍俊不禁。😄 由于这里的游客大都是巴西人或南美其他国家的西班牙语使用者（他们对听懂看懂同为拉丁语系的葡萄牙语没什么大问题），本地人也就很少说除了母语外的其他语言。这对我来说可是个不小的打击啊，英语自然是用不上，破烂的西班牙语也不足以让我猜测出飞快的葡语的意思。所以，这种原汁原味的旅行真是一种有意思的折磨，痛并快乐着。

The views in these 2 pictures are both framed by the fence in front of me. When shooting the first photo, I focused on the white fence to show its intricate flowery pattern. While for the second photo, I focused on the famous bridge behind as the fence is pretty common.  

上面这两张照片都是利用面前的栏杆作为边框。拍第一张时，聚焦在了白色的栏杆上，以突出精美的雕花图案。而拍第二张时，把焦点对在了后面有名的大桥上。

## 
The "framed" picture on the left was taken in San Sebastián, north of Spain. This pretty town is known for its beaches framed by a bayfront promenade where I shot this photo. Through the white fence, you can see the picturesque Bahía de la Concha (literally The Shell Bay due to its shape of a "shell" ) and the Isla de Santa Clara (the island in distance). 

The beaches here are incredibly crowded since it's a popular resort town, but what attracts me the most is its plenty bars and restaurants serving a great varieties of delicious pintxos(bite-size snacks from Basque Country, similar to tapas) and other innovative regional specialties.   


上面左边的照片拍于西班牙北部的巴斯克重镇圣塞巴斯蒂安。这座精致的古城以月牙形的海湾著称。我这张照片就是在海滩边的滨海道上拍的。白色的栏杆框住了后面的“贝壳湾”和圣克拉拉小岛的美景。

由于圣塞巴斯蒂安是欧洲有名的度假胜地，这里的海滩也是人山人海。不过这里最吸引我的反正也不是海滩，而是遍布古城的巴斯克美食！除了花样繁多、便宜可口的pintxos（类似西班牙tapas的开胃小菜），这里还聚集着一批世界顶级的大厨，不断推出各种创意美食，在全球美食界占有一席之地。

## 
The second picture was clicked in Istanbul, Turkey. The bridge framed by the fence is the 15 July Martyrs Bridge or the better known Bosphorus Bridge. This First Bridge is one of the three suspension bridges spanning the Bosphorus strait which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara. Bosphorus strait is a strategic waterway and  natural boundary between Asia and Europe. So Bosphorus Bridge is connecting Asian Turkey and European Turkey. One city spans 2 continents, pretty cool right? I experienced this also in Russia which I will talk about in my future post, and I would love to visit Atyrau in Kazakhstan one day, another city spanning Asia and Europe. 

右边的照片是在土耳其的伊斯坦布尔拍的。栏杆后的大桥就是有名的博斯普鲁斯大桥，横跨同名海峡，连接土耳其的欧洲和亚洲两部分。这样一座横跨欧亚两洲的城市是不是很酷？曾经在俄罗斯也有经历这样的一城跨两洲，以后会渐渐渐渐地在某一天聊到 ;)。据说哈萨克斯坦的阿特劳市也是这样：欧亚两洲的界河乌拉尔河穿城而过，将其一分为二。希望以后有机会去看看。

So that's it about some "framed" photos in my travels. There are many more but I can't make the post too long. =) Hope you like them! Tell me what you think in the comments below. Until next time! 

好了，今天的分享就到这里，希望你们喜欢。还有很多自带边框的旅途剪影，只是篇幅有限，以后有机会再扯。欢迎留言评论，下次见！:D
