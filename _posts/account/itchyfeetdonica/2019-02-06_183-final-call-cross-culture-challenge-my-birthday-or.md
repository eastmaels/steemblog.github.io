**Greetings everyone! This is the final call to join【Cross-culture Challenge】.** 

Many Steemians have entered their amazing posts or comments in the past few weeks, and you still have 4 days left to join the fun! =) The deadline for submitting your entry is the last minute of Feb 10th Brussels time zone (Central European Standard Time - GMT+1). 

## 
Feb 7th is my birthday (already so in China but still 6 hours left here in Europe), so I'd like to talk a bit about the birthday celebrations in my home country and in a few countries I lived. The celebrations surely vary with different families or individuals even in the same country. I'm only comapring based on my personal experiences. 

In China, lots of young people celebrate their birthdays by eating in a restaurant and/or singing in a Karaoke with friends. While in some Western coutries, restaurants are kind of expensive and different from the numerous eateries in Asia (the same level of food quality and service you usually pay much less in China), so many of my Western friends and classmates choose to throw a party at home offering snacks and drinks. I've seen as well  young people celebrating in fast food places like McDonald's. Sometimes the group go to a bar or do bar hopping to keep on drinking, chatting and dancing. 

In Puerto Rico and other Latin parties I experienced,  the drinking and dancing part takes a vital role. Many Latins seem to be born with a dancing talent, while most of my Asian friends prefer to sing in a confined Karaoke box... ;)

</div>While I lived in Chile and Australia, BBQ is also a popular way to celebrate birthday. In every apartment and house I rent in these 2 countries, there's a dedicated part for BBQ, normally in the backyard of the house or on top floor of the apartment building. I really enjoyed this way of meeting up with friends too. =)

##
Of course, there are also Chinese celebrating at home and Westerners getting together in restaurants, it's just I can't cover each individual case. What about you? How do you normally celebrate birthday? Tell me in the comments please! :)

各位新年好~ 这是最后一次召集大家参加【跨文化活动】！这些天有很多朋友参与留言或发帖，比较了他们所经历或听闻的文化差异，非常有意思。如果你有兴趣，还有四天时间准备。最后期限是中欧时间2月10号的最后一秒（比北京时间晚7小时）。

## 
2月7号是我的生日🎂，北京时间已经到了，但欧洲这边还差6个小时。所以我来聊聊自己所经历的各文化中庆祝生日的不同。当然，别说各国，就算同一个地方的不同家庭或个人庆祝生日的方式也不会都一样。我只能从个人的有限经历来比较一下喽~

我在中国呆过的地方都在江南，很多年轻人比较喜欢请朋友去下馆子大吃一顿，然后可能去唱K或者蹦迪、压马路之类。 而西欧国家同等的餐馆大都比较贵，还能安静出个鸟来，各种礼仪讲究，有点拘谨，庆生也没什么气氛（拉丁国家又不一样，多次亲见一桌人把整个饭店变成载歌载舞的欢乐海洋🎉🎊）。所以常见到些年轻人在类似麦当劳这样的快餐店里庆祝，也有不少朋友在家办生日趴，准备些零食酒水，一群人或站或坐，或熟或生的人群/食物，端着杯酒水，各种神聊或尬聊。

 然后在波多黎各等很拉丁的国家，生日趴上的喝酒和跳舞又被上升到了一个新高度。拉丁人种仿佛生来一副水蛇腰，几岁的小孩子跳舞也超有韵律感，而不少东亚人似乎更喜欢默默地躲在卡拉OK的包间里引吭高歌😃。。。

住在智利和澳洲时，烧烤也是很受欢迎的庆生方式。所有租住过的公寓和平房里都有配备BBQ场地和器材。前者在公寓楼的顶层会配有几个烤架、空间等给居民共用，后者一般在后院里。缕缕轻烟中，串串小食翻转烘烤着，三五好友，相聚欢谈，个人觉得这比喝酒吃冷盘要惬意许多咯~

那你呢？你们那里一般是怎么庆祝生日的？欢迎留言告诉我~ 😊

**So why a cross-culture challenge?** ❓ 

Like I said in my intro post:
>I'm most enthusiastic about traveling, photography, cooking, art... I believe any traveler understands this wanderlust - you just can't have enough. By traveling far and wide, you discover new ways of living and understand other cultures to appreciate them, you constantly get inspired and would ultimately better yourself. Especially when you travel solo, you set yourself free and interact more with locals. You start to judge less and accept more. 
...
>I do, like many of you foodies there, take great pleasure in eating and cooking. And I try to learn cooking from different cultures during my travels, to spice up my own experiments on food fusion...

##
There is a great variety of cultures on this planet, and each culture has its own charm. Lived across 5 continets and traveled to over 60 countries, I have been mesmerised by all the different cultures. Steemians here come from all over the world with rich cultural backgrounds. It would be fun to exchange some ideas/photos/videos... Exchange makes change. Live and let live. So my challenge will focus on "cross-culture". 

To join this challenge, you just need to **compare 2 or more cultures that you have experienced**. Any form of content is welcome, you can write a short essay, post a photo story, create a drawing/painting/animation/design, share a quick video, record your voice of talking or singing... all fine! It would be great to hear your personal stories soaking up in different cultures. Share your inspiration with us! 

## 
**Then what is culture?** 🧐

Back in my uni course of Cultural Studies, there's been heated discussion about what exactly culture is. To some extent, it seems almost everything can be seen as culture. To give you a bit inspiration, here's one of the definitions:

>Culture is the characteristics and knowledge of a particular group of people, encompassing language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts, etc..

Inspire me and other Steemians! Tell us any culture shock you experienced or any changes it brought to you!
