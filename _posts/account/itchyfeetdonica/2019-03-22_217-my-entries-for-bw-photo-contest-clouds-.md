Hey everyone! How's your weekend going so far? Here I'm sharing some photos of clouds, 3 of them as my entries to the B&W Photo Contest.

大家周末好啊~ 今天分享三组单色云的照片，希望你们喜欢。=)

I took these 2 photos near the Lago Grey lake inside Torres del Paine national park of Chile. This dramatic lenticular cloud formation is commonly seen in this region. As the lens clouds look like flying saucers, they have been mistaken by some people as UFOs. I talked about it last year in my post of Grey Glacier.

The epic views in the second group of photos are by Río Cañuma, close to Juliaca and Puno in Peru. It was freezing cold high up at about 4300 meters even when I was there in summer time, but this breathtaking (literally too) scenery just held me spellbound. :)

The volcano in the first photo here is Licancabur, which could be seen from many corners of the area. After hiking to a hilltop in the Moon Valley, I was stunned by the surreal scene. The clouds floated around the magnificent mountains, and under my feet was the moon-like terrain. 

Impressed by the candyflossy clouds and the rugged hills, I snapped the second picture with my phone from a bus leaving the Atacama region.
