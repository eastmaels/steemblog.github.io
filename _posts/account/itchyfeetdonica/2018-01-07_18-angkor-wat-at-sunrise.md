I captured this moment of sunrise at Angkor Wat, Cambodia. As a national symbol of Cambodia, 🇰🇭 Angkor Wat is the country’s prime attraction that draws a large number of visitors all year round. 

This temple complex is the largest religious monument in the world, built by a Khmer King as a Hindu temple of god Vishnu in the early 12th century, gradually transforming into a Buddhist temple towards the end of the same century.

You can visit Angkor Wat as well as other religious sites such as Angkor Thom, Bayon, Preah Khan, Banteay Srei, Pre Rup, Ta Prohm, Terrace of the Elephants..., in an extensive jungle area a bit north of Siem Reap, a base for exploring those amazing ancient temples and surrounds. 

7-day pass is a good choice since there’s quite some distance between certain sites, and there’s so much to see at each site. If you are short of time, you can also choose the 3-day pass. Remember to bring sunscreen and cool clothes for the heat, and cover your shoulders and knees as required by the religious culture. 

We got up at 4am in Siem Reap that day and arrived at the Angkor Wat site by e-bike (faster and cooler than the tuk tuk) at around 5:10am, when it’s already packed with visitors. After walking through the causeway, the waiting game started by the reflection pond in front of the main temple. There were people waiting in different spots, and I picked this spot with less heads in front. 

All the crowds were waiting for that exciting moment in silence. The sun finally appeared over the horizon at 6:10am, shining through the trees and spangling the water surface. The flickering ripples in the pond started to dance with the golden sun rays... then the yellow sphere quickly glided up the trees, in a few minutes, the whole sky was lit up. ☀️

Pretty stunning right? As a night person, I can’t get up early, so I take much more sunset shots than sunrise ones. But I once read that at sunset the sky is full of pollutants and wind-borne particles, while more colors can be perceived at dawn than at dusk. So do you like this photo in dawn colors? What time of the day do you prefer - dawn or dusk? Tell me what you think in the comments please!

这张日出的照片是我在柬埔寨的吴哥窟拍摄的。作为国家的象征，吴哥窟实在是太有名了，连柬埔寨国旗🇰🇭上都印着它的图案。每年自然吸引了无数游客前来观光。

这一寺庙建筑群是世界上最大的宗教纪念性建筑，公元十二世纪早期由一位高棉国王下令建造，起初是想建成印度教主神毗瑟挐的印度庙，结果到了世纪晚期逐渐变成了佛教寺庙。

除了吴哥窟，暹粒北边这一片丛林里的古迹还有吴哥城、巴戎寺、宝剑塔、女王宫、变身塔、塔普伦寺、斗象台等。有些遗址间相距较远，而每个遗址又有很多细节可以看，所以建议购买七日票，去慢慢看个够，如果时间紧张也可以买三日票，而一日票就太赶了，走马观花也看不到什么。记得要带防晒霜和凉快透气的衣服，丛林常有的高温高湿和强紫外线实在是伤不起啊。出于对当地宗教文化的尊重，进寺庙等宗教建筑的时候，上衣最好遮住肩膀，下身长及膝盖。

我们那天四点就起床了，洗漱后就骑着电动摩托车🏍️风驰电掣般往吴哥窟狂奔（大部分游人是坐三轮车去的，当然也有土豪包车去）。一路上耳边风声呼呼，超越三轮车四轮车无数，等五点十分抵达停车处，已然是人山人海。停好车顺着水上长堤和人流走一截，再过西门继续走，最后来到吴哥窟前方的两个池塘中间，找了个前面人头较少的一块湿地落下脚，饥困交迫地开始了等待。

四周一片寂静，所有人都在等待那神圣一刻的到来。六点十分的时候，金黄色的圆球开始跃升出地平线，透过树影，点亮水面，池塘潋滟的波纹在柔和的光线下跃动起舞…… ☀️这轮发光体很快滑上树梢，挂在空中。整个过程短短几分钟，接着气温陡然上升，困倦的双眼被这万丈光芒刺得无法睁开，一颗小心却久久不能平静，起个大早经历等待后终于看到了这朝思暮想的一刻。

这日出是不是挺美的？身为夜猫子，我拍过很多日落，却很少拍到日出。但是看到书上说傍晚日落时的天空有不少细小的污染颗粒和风载尘埃，而日出时天空更纯净，色彩更缤纷。你觉得呢？赶快留言告诉我你的想法吧！=)
