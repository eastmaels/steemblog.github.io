Hey everyone, here's a meal I had last weekend - Dorado fish with crab risotto and asparagus. It's my entry for the Tasty Tuesday competition by @qurator. 

##
上周末吃的海鲤蟹肉饭，里面还搭配了三种芦笋 - 常见的绿芦笋、见不得光长在地下的白芦笋和口感爽脆的海芦笋。眼前满满一盘子的春天~ :)

The Dorado fish meat is tender and a bit sweet. It is low on fat and pretty firm in texture. Its mild flavor goes very well with the more salty and rich crab risotto underneath. The crunchy marsh samphire (glasswort, sea bean, pickleweed, picklegrass) and the two types of asparagus add a fresh taste to the dish. You can smell the spring! 

The white asparagus has a hint of bitterness and is softer than the green one. It's also more expensive as a result of the more time-consuming growing method. They have to be buried underground to avoid any sunlight which would turn them green. I personally prefer the grassy green asparagus than the more fibrous white one. What about you? And some call the marsh samphire sea asparagus, so there are 3 types of asparagus in this plate! :)

Some delicate deserts afterwards including the high-quality Belgian chocolates as always:
