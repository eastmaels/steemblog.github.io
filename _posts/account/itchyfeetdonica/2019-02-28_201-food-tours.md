Hey, this is my dinner tonight in an Asian restaurant called [Kyoto Sushi](http://www.kyotosushi.be):  fried rice with scampi and vegetables, and a cup of mint tea. It's also my entry to join the 50th edition of the @STEEMFoodTours challenge by @jeffjagoe. Check it out and join the fun if you are a foodie too! :) 

As the restaurant's name suggests, it's focusing on different types of sushi. But since it's a raining and chilly night here in Belgium, I didn't feel like eating cold sushi. Instead, I ordered a plate of stir-fried rice and a cup of heart-warming tea. The food here is not top-notch, but pretty tasty. The dishes they serve are kind of Asian food fusion, like many other Asian eateries in Western countries, to cater to both locals as well as eaters from other countries. 

The staff is very friendly and their service is fast. But their square tables are a bit too tiny for all the food and drinks, especially when it's a huge portion. I'm not a big fan of their decor - too much red everywhere which makes me feel dizzy, haha.

The mint tea(water) is fresh and not so sweet as the traditional Moroccan mint tea I tried, because there's no sugar in it but aside. The picture is also my entry to the new challenge - "Tea Time" in CN community, hosted by @aellly and @xiaoshancun.
