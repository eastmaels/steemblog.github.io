Here is a closeup photo I took in Rose Valley of Morocco. You can see the details of the white roses and the little bee in natural sunlight. The pollen stuffed into the bee's hairy receptacles on hind legs is also clearly visible. :)

It's my entry to the Close-up(Macrography) Contest by @ntopaz. What do you think of this picture? Do you have macro photos to share as well? Don't hesitate to join the fun! 

The definition on their page:

>Close-up(Macrography) is an image taken at a scale that is visible to the naked eye, as opposed to a micrographic image. It is sometimes defined more precisely as an image at a scale of less than ten times magnification.

Below is the original image before it's cropped by the site:
