<h2>Project Details</h2>
## 
GDevelop is an open-source, cross-platform game creator. It doesn't require any programming skills, so it's easy to use. 

Anyone can use GDevelop to create 2D games, such as platformers, puzzles, shoot 'em up, strategy, 8-bit games... It can be simple projects for fun or more ambitious indie games. 

Events is a unique feature of GDevelop. It's a powerful way to express the logic of your game without a programming language.

Users can publish games created with GDevelop to the web, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux and even Facebook Messenger. Games can also be exported in one click to Android from the app. 

GDevelop also offers visual editors to prototype new features, and the game engine can be extended with Javascript.

Tutorials, examples and a complete documentation for the software are available. 

As a wonderful opportunity to teach programming and game making, GDevelop has already been used in classrooms and online courses, with digital media students or children in first grade.

## 
Before I started the translation of GDevelop, I first read through the project on Crowdin and in GitHub. Except for the GDevelop 5 I'm translating, their website is to be translated. 

This project's user-friendly and creative features interests me. I believe it's a great tool that helps people without any programming knowledge turn their ideas into reality. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Hopefully my translation in Simplified Chinese bring more users to this platform. I'd love to see the large number of Chinese makers and educators benefit from this tool. So they can unleash their creativity to build games or programmes, and inspire students to do so as well.

**Translation Overview**

As you can see from the screenshots below, this project consists of 2 files - GDevelop 5 (editor) and GDevelop (core and extensions). The second file has been translated partly by others. I started from the first file at 0%, and finished 36% (1,054 of 2,906 words) in my first submission.

## 
Different from the whole context of Quasar Framework documentation, the GDevelop 5 file  includes short independent strings about the game editor. It took less time in translating each string, but sometimes it's more difficult to opt for an accurate Chinese word choice due to the lack of a complete picture. 

I truly appreciate the help from my proofreader @aafeng, who has always been very patient and helpful. He examined my translation work promptly and suggested a few changes. I'm looking forward to working on the left part of this file, as well as finishing the second part - core and extensions.

## 
**Languages**

I translate from English to Simplified Chinese.

## 
**Word Count**

I have translated 1054 words in this submission:
