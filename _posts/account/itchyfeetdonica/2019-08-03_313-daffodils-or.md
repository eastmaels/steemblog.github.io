When you see daffodils blooming in the wild, you know that spring is here. I've walked through impressive daffodil production fields in the Netherlands in spring time, and they are also very common in the gardens in Belgium. 

It's a flower associated with spring festivals like Lent and Easter in many Western countries. As you can see from my second photo here, the daffodils are "springing" out from an "egg". 🙂

In the West the daffodil is also perceived as a symbol of vanity and misfortune, perhaps from the self-obsessed Narcissus in Greek mythology. While in some Eastern nations, it's a symbol of beauty and wealth. 

In China, the most popular daffodil is Narcissus tazetta var. chinensis. Its Chinese name literally means Water Fairy, and it's normally cultivated in water as an ornamental plant indoors. People adore its pure white petals, elegant shape and intoxicating fragrance. Like the Greek mythology and William Wordsworth's poem, there have also been legends and poems in China about this flower.

Here's a video by The Wordsworth Trust, telling the story of how Wordsworth's well-known poem 'Daffodils' was composed. Also check out the beautiful Lake District featuerd in it! Hope I can visit this area as soon as possible. =)

>The most famous poem in the English language was written in 1804, two years after William Wordsworth saw the daffodils while walking by the shores of Ullswater on a stormy day with Dorothy, his sister. Wordsworth's inspiration for the poem came from an account written by Dorothy in her journal.

><h2>Daffodils</h2>

>by William Wordsworth

>I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

>Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

>The waves beside them danced, but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed' and gazed' but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

>For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
>Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.
