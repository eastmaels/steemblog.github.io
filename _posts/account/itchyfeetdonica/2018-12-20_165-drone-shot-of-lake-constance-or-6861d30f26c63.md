How's it going my fellow Steemians? It's Thursday again, a day for images from Europe! :) So I'm sharing a shot by a drone (DJI Mavic Pro) above Lake Constance in Europe. I was at the sandy shore flying the little friend for a video of the lake region, and clicked this picture during its flight.

It's my entry for the #TravelPhotoContest by @lightcaptured, a great photographer on Steemit. I've seen his cool posts by curating for Steemitworldmap, and now I'm very excited to find his brand new contest that combines travel and photography. I guess this is not only my passion, but also lots and lots of other Steemians', right? Check out the contest and join the travel photo fun!

Lake Constance is known as Bodensee in German language. It is a huge lake that borders Austria, Germany and Switzerland. When I look at the seemingly endless lake surface from a certain angle, I feel it's a vast sea, just like Lake Baikal and Lake Titicaca I visited before.

Since I used to live and am living now in Belgium which boarders Germany, I frequently passed this lake during road trips, or stayed a few days at a town by the riverside. In summer, it's a popular destination for water sports like sailing, windsurfing and swimming. It's also relaxing to just sit by the river, reading, chatting or having a picnic. You can also pedal your bike around the entire lake on a cycle path for about 270km. I only tried driving but I believe it's a great way to see the lake and the sites nearby.  Will you give it a try?

I would recommend the following places to visit along the way: 

**Wollmatinger Ried**:  a nature reserve to protect the rich flora and fauna;
**Lindau**:  the largest town on the Bavarian shores;
**Konstanz**:  boasts a beautiful old town and a historic harbor;
**Mainau**:   a very touristic but amazing flower island;
**Reichenau**:   Lake Constance's largest island that was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site and preserves the traces of the Benedictine monastery;
**Pfahlbaumuseum Unteruhldingen**:   an open-air museum displaying the German-style stilt houses;
**Allgäu upland**:   a picturesque mountain region between Lake Constance and the Lech valley.

大家好~ 今天分享的是用DJI无人机Mavic Pro在康斯坦茨湖上空俯拍的照片。我当时在湖边的沙滩上拍这个湖区的全景视频，小机机飞行途中看到几个角度还不错就也拍了几张照片。

这个大湖在德国、奥地利和瑞士交界处，面积大得常常让我产生错觉是在看海，就像去过的俄罗斯贝加尔湖和南美的滴滴咔咔湖一样，湖水清澈、一望无际、辽阔悠远。夏天的时候，很多人来这里玩水上运动，在湖边野餐、看书、跟家人朋友散散步聊聊天。或者，什么都不做，什么都不想，坐在湖边发发呆看看“海”，也自有一番舒心惬意~。
