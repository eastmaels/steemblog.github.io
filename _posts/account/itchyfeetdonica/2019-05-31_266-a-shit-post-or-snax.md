Over the last few weeks, lots of Steemians have been linking their Steem account to the Snax blockchain, and a lovely friend @livinguktaiwan joked that she was cursing them for making a shit post and that she did the same. 


I commented that I would add a head picture of a great poop in my post if I link it too, then my content might look a bit less shitty with the original touch... ;) And last night, 2 CN shining tycoons @deanliu and @ericet informed me that my Steem Attention Rate was ranked the 50th ahead of other CN users on Snax at that moment. I was like, really? That's pretty ridiculous, as I was not even super active recently. Hmmm, looked like a nice algorithm... And it reminded me again to do this shit post to embrace the cool new kid in town. :)


So here we go, let me present you this precious poop photo I took earlier this month in the Sahara. It was after a storm, I found this little insect next to a camel (dromedary to be exact) poop.

Don't you think dung beetle is an amazing creature? They can roll those massive dung balls like a pro with so much tenacity and perseverance. Sounds a bit like us Steemians who still stick to this platform with no less passion even when the price is so low? ;p 


I even did a meme to make my image look more wiseass. As I was thinking one man's trash can be another man's treasure. I guess you guys know what the original quote is?

Remember to check out the Snax blockchain if you haven't done it already. This is not a shitty idea but quite the opposite. According to @snaxteam, the deadline of their [bounty program](https://snax.one/promo/steem-bounty) was prolonged from today until June 10. Up till now, only 213k Snax tokens of 5M have been distributed. So if you are interested, you still have 10 days to grab your piece of the pie! 

And as a member of @SteemitWorldMap team, I'm glad to say that we are about to award our Map users with Snax tokens  soon, so stay tuned! =)   

<br />

I want to link my Steem account with my account on Snax blockchain using https://snax.one
Please, create Snax account for me!

各位周末好~ 这是我关联Snax的魔咒帖。最近几周很多朋友都关联过了，刘美女和新手村长也写过关于Snax的详细教程，昨天他们关于关注度的讨论再次提醒了懒癌晚期的我。一个好消息是Snax团队把他们[奖励活动](https://snax.one/promo/steem-bounty)的最后期限从今天推迟到了6月10号，所以对此感兴趣但还没写文推广Snax的小伙伴们又可以继续拖延啦~

这里配的图是我前些天在撒哈拉沙漠拍到的屎壳郎和骆驼粪，因为受到Livinguktaiwan说的shitpost的启发。;)

我觉得屎壳郎真的超酷，能利用月光偏振现象进行定位来帮助取食，还总是锲而不舍、持之以恒地滚动比自己大那么多倍的粪球，这种独特的生物难道不是一种神奇的存在吗？它们的耐心和毅力也让我想到仍旧在Steem平台上耕耘的小伙伴们，虽然币价一直低迷，大家还是热情不减、坚持不懈~~我好能联想啊~~……


因为好奇推粪君努力的全程，我在网上一通搜索，在b站看到这部有着磁性嗓音解说的[屎壳郎君滚粪球的励志纪录片](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av10470984/)，看得我笑到飙泪（真的），如果你心情不好或者需要激励，强烈建议收看，记得备好纸巾。=)
