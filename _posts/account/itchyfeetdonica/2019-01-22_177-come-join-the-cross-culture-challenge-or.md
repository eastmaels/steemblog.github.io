## 
Greetings everyone! Time flies - I've joined Steemit for over a year, and I am grateful for many communities and friends that have been constantly supporting and inspiring me.  

To celebrate this anniversary and to give back to the Steem community, I am hosting a cross-culture challenge. (Thanks @Partiko for sponsoring part of the rewards!) Let's join some fun in this bear market! :)

## 
**So why a cross-culture challenge?** ❓ 

Like I said in my intro post:
>I'm most enthusiastic about traveling, photography, cooking, art... I believe any traveler understands this wanderlust - you just can't have enough. By traveling far and wide, you discover new ways of living and understand other cultures to appreciate them, you constantly get inspired and would ultimately better yourself. Especially when you travel solo, you set yourself free and interact more with locals. You start to judge less and accept more. 
...
>I do, like many of you foodies there, take great pleasure in eating and cooking. And I try to learn cooking from different cultures during my travels, to spice up my own experiments on food fusion...

##
There is a great variety of cultures on this planet, and each culture has its own charm. Lived across 5 continets and traveled to over 60 countries, I have been mesmerised by all the different cultures. Steemians here come from all over the world with rich cultural backgrounds. It would be fun to exchange some ideas/photos/videos... Exchange makes change. Live and let live. So my challenge will focus on "cross-culture". 

To join this challenge, you just need to **compare 2 or more cultures that you have experienced**. Any form of content is welcome, you can write a short essay, post a photo story, create a drawing/painting/animation/design, share a quick video, record your voice of talking or singing... all fine! It would be great to hear your personal stories soaking up in different cultures. Share your inspiration with us! 

## 
**Then what is culture?** 🧐

Back in my uni course of Cultural Studies, there's been heated discussion about what exactly culture is. To some extent, it seems almost everything can be seen as culture. To give you a bit inspiration, here's one of the definitions:

>Culture is the characteristics and knowledge of a particular group of people, encompassing language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts, etc..

##
So that's it, just go pick a cultural topic (language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts, etc..) from 2 or more particular groups of people that you are familiar with, and show the differences to us in a certain form. Inspire me and other Steemians! Tell us any culture shock you experienced or any changes it brought to you! 

Here are the rules and rewards 👇
