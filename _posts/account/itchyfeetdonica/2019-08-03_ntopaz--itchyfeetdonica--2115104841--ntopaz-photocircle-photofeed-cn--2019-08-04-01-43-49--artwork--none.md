I shot this close-up of a water stream when standing on a slippery rock. It was on a hiking trip in the Picos de Europa national park of Northern Spain. It’s really refreshing dipping into this crystal clear cool creek under the scorching sun! 🌞 

It's my entry to the Close-up(Macrography) Contest by @ntopaz. I like the flowing water texture presented this way and the bokeh effect of the splashes down there. What do you think of this picture? Do you have macro photos to share as well? Don't hesitate to join the fun! 


The definition of Macrography on their page:

>Close-up(Macrography) is an image taken at a scale that is visible to the naked eye, as opposed to a micrographic image. It is sometimes defined more precisely as an image at a scale of less than ten times magnification.

Below is the original image before it's cropped by the site:
