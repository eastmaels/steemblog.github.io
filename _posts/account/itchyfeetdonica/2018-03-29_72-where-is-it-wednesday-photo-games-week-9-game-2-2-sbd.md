## ABOUT THE PHOTO
Like most of my photos, this one hasn't been posted anywhere before(drum roooooll for this debut...). I hope the pretty flowers, magnificent mountains and the amazing lake can give you some hints, or not? I actually planned to post a random mountain photo from Kosovo at first, but then I realized maybe some friends haven't even heard of that place, so I changed to this easier one. Where do you think it is? Come tell me your guess and win the HUGE prize - 1SBD (can be even more if you get really close)! =)

## RULES & HOW TO PLAY
 
For _**Where is it Wednesday**_ we would like you to _**Guess the location of the photo**_

1. The closest guess will win the prize, be as specific as you can!
2. Only *one* guess per person, per post.
3. No editing your guess -  you have to commit!
4. All metadata has been stripped from the pictures, so don’t bother looking for the EXIF!
5. We are not required to tell you what kind of camera was used, or what time of day the photo was taken at, or whether filters were involved (this adds to the mystery and the challenge!)
6. For this game you have 2 days to guess (Friday 6PM EST / 11PM UTC)
7. If only one person gets the correct (or closest) answer they will win full prize pool
8. If multiple people guess correctly (tie for 1st): 60% to first person / 40% divided between the next 5 people
9. If no one comes up with the correct location, the prize will go either to the closest guess, or (if no one is even close) will be rolled over into next week’s pot.
