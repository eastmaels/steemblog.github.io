Hey everyone! Today I'm sharing some flower photos I shot in the Atacama desert region of Chile. 

Most part of the Atacama Desert is situated on the Pacific coast of Chile, west of the Andes mountains. This area is one of the driest places as well as the only true desert in the world to receive less precipitation than the polar deserts. The average annual rainfall here is about 15 mm (0.6 in), although some weather stations have never received rain.

In spite of the extreme conditions of the desert, some flowers like the white one in my pictures are still blooming. This small slim flower might not be as pretty as many other types, but what an extraordinary ability it has to adapt to this harsh environment! I have no idea what it is called. Anyone knows please tell me in the comment. :)

今天分享的是我在智利北部的阿塔卡马沙漠地带拍的花。这是地球上最干热的地方之一，整块地区全年平均降雨量只有15毫米，很多地方历史上没有任何降水。

这种细小的白花不如很多其他花朵那么鲜艳饱满，但在这种严酷的沙漠环境下，它们顽强的生命力让我不由自主地拍了好几张。
