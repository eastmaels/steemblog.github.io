I shot the photo in Omo Valley in the south of Ethiopia. This tribe is close to Omorate by the borders of South Sudan and Kenya. The man in my photo was the only male adult I found there, among all the women, kids, huts and herds. Looking at his headpiece, perhaps he is the tribal chief. People in this tribe decorate their bodies with elaborate accessories made mostly of beads and metals. They also like dressing in bright-colored fabrics, and some of them paint parts of their bodies.  

To show you his living environment, also to prove this is my photo work as required by the hostess, here are 2 more photos of the same man:
