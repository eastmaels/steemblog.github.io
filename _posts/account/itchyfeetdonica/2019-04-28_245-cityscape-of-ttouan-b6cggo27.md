This is the view of Tétouan from a hilltop. The northern Moroccan city lies along the Martil Valley and is my first major stop after landing on the African continent from the strait of Gibraltar.

I enjoyed walking around this “white city”. As you can see from my photos, white buildings clustered on the side of the verdant Riff mountains, with some red, yellow and green roofs.

Tétouan is one of the two major Mediterranean ports of Morocco and is the administrative capital of the country’s Spanish zone. Many locals here speak Arabic, French and Spanish. I feel like I’m back to multilingual Belgium again! :)

Not so famous as Chefchaouen, Fez or Marrakesh, it has its unique charm. Its entire old medina is recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Site. And it has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the area of Crafts and Folk Art. Enough proof huh? 

Much more experiences and closeup photos from my camera are coming in the future when faster stable internet is available. =)
