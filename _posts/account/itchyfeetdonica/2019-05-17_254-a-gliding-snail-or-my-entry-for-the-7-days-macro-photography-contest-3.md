Greetings fellow Steemians! In this post I'm sharing some photos of a land snail I captured. It's my entry to @flamingirl's 7 DAYS MACRO-PHOTOGRAPHY CONTEST 3 🐜. 

I found this snail on a thick tropical leaf in the central mountains of Puerto Rico (la Cordillera Central).  This little creature was gliding along slowly on its muscular foot lubricated with mucus. You can clearly see its two pairs of tentacles in the sunshine. Ever since I was a little girl, I was mesmerized by snail's spiral shells that are mostly right-handed in their neat coiling.

这几张蜗牛的照片拍于波多黎各中部的山区。它缓慢地在一大片厚厚的绿叶上挪动，阳光下两对触角清晰可见。
