So this is my look on the way to the almighty Sahara dunes. :D The blue tagelmust on my head was bought from a Berber vendor at the roadside. It is an indigo-dyed cotton garment that acts as both a veil (see my second photo below) and a turban. He told me the blue's a lucky color for the Berber men in the desert. 

Ok, though I'm neither a Berber nor a man, this long piece of fabric was pretty handy to shield the incredibly strong wind, scorching sun and spreading sand. I'm glad that I went local, and the color scheme of my outfit was even in line with the environment. :)

At first I looked like this:

I saw the theme of this week's @portraitcontest is Fashion, so I'd like to join it too, but I'm not sure if it qualifies? It's not a typical fashion shot in a studio. No fancy dress, no fine makeup, no artificial lighting... just a portrait of me in some Berber fashion and with genuine smile. I didn't act cool like a model as the surrounding nature was way cooler... ;)

All of a sudden these "wise" words popped up in my mind:
>How do you get a beach body? 
Have a body + go to the beach   

## 
Actually the blueish lake behind me is more impressive than my blue turban, isn't it? It's a reservoir close to Errachidia. Once again, I was impressed by the joined force of our Mother Nature and the humans. The reservoir is called Lake Hassan Eddakhil. It is situated at Foum Rhour on the Ziz river in Morocco’s Tafilalet province. 

Construction work on the dam was conducted from 1968 to 1971, in order to regularise the wadi to develop the agriculture in the Ziz valley, as well as to provide flood protection. But as always, a dam also causes sustained environmental impacts.

Zooooom ooooout and ooooout:
