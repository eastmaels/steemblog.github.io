What's up fellow Steemians! Today I'm sharing some photos of oldtimer tractors I shot last month in the Austrian Alps. It's inspired by @derangedvisions's  photography contest - Need for Speed. @derangedvisions is an awesome photographer and filmmaker. Go check out his page and join the photo fun (after you read my post ;p)!

I saw these cool tractors when driving up the Grossglockner, Austria’s highest mountain. It is the centerpiece of the High Tauern National Park in the Eastern Alps. Needless to say, the Grossglockner High Alpine Road nestled between green mountain pastures, waterfalls and glaciers is breathtaking. You can have a sneak peek from my head image in this post. But my main purpose today is to show you these lovely vehicles on my way to the peak and at the Edelweißspitze viewpoint. 

These old tractors were restored and painted bright colors. I guess their owners took very good care of them. Like me, quite a lot of people at the parking were taking photos of these shiny stars. ;) It must be a pretty amazing experience driving these tractors up and down the alpine road! 😃

👆 There were also motorcyclists riding up the mountains.


<br/>  

Some of the tractors had fancy enhancements to their parts. Look at this sparkling beauty:

I heard there are festivals about vintage tractors in some villages in Europe, such as this ["Oldtimer Festival"](http://www.hmck.be/english) in Belgium. It is a yearly show held in Ravels since 1988, and it has evolved from collections of old agricultural vehicles and machinery. If you love vintage tractors and other machines, don’t miss these fun events. 
<br/>  

Ok, that's it for today's oldtimer tractors. Did you see tractors like these before? Have you ever tried driving this kind of vehicle? :)

大家好！今天分享的是我在阿尔卑斯山区看到的一些翻新的老式拖拉机。它们被漆成闪亮的绿、蓝、红等鲜艳的颜色，在阳光的照耀下熠熠生辉，十分抢眼。还有的车发动机也被改装，看上去很酷炫。我先是在开往奥地利最高峰 — 大钟山的高山公路上偶遇几位老年绅士，他们开着这些老爷车，往山下突突驰骋。是不是很拉轰？:D 后来到了高处的观景台上，又看到更多颜色厂牌各异的老车。其他游客也纷纷拿出手机相机，对着这些耀眼的明星一通狂拍。=) 

你觉得这些老爷车怎么样？尝试过驾驶类似的拖拉机吗？哈哈，我很好奇自己能否在十八弯的高山公路上hold住这些大家伙，不敢想象我这种小只生物杵在这种拖拉机上是什么样的画面......
