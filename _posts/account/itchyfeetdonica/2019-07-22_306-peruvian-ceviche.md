The heat wave here makes me crave for the tasty cold dish ceviche/cebiche. Originated in Peru, this treat has become popular across the Americas, and it's not difficult to find it in big cities in other parts of the world. 

Here I'm sharing a photo of ceviche I had in Arequiba of Peru. I ate the dish almost every week when living in Chile and traveling through Peru, and it’s always an enjoyable experience. :)  I'd love to share much much more delicious Peruvian food in future when I find time to go through my pictures. 

Ceviche is typically made from raw fish cured in lime or lemon juice, and spiced with chili peppers and other seasonings like onions, cilantro and salt. And in Peru, most ceviche dishes I tried were accompanied by side dishes, such as sweet potato, toasted corns, plantain chips and lettuce. As you can see from my photo, these colorful elements look very pleasant and help open up appetite. 

The tangy sour flavor goes so well with the cold fresh fish, plus its healthy dose, it’s such a delight to enjoy in summer time! 

Have you also tried ceviche before? Do you like it?
