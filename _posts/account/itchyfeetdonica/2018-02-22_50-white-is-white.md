Here are my 3 shots of white flowers. The tulips in the first picture were captured in Keukenhof. Keukenhof is known as the largest flower garden in the world, and it's situated in Lisse, a town south of Haarlem, between Amsterdam and The Hague in Netherlands. 

There are over 3000 varieties of tulips, with many different colors too.  White tulips are popular as wedding bouquets.  They are in the range from pure white to a more creamy white.  

Tulips are widely cultivated in the Netherlands, and in the spring, tulip festivals abound throughout the country. Besides Keukenhof, you can find a huge amount of tulips in places like Kop van Noord-Holland, Noordoostpolder, and Aalsmeer. 

The Dutch people loved bringing tulips to new countries when they settled down abroad, for example, in New York, there is also a tulip festival. Originally named New Amsterdam, there is a strong connection here to Dutch roots. 

And in this post, I'd love to share with you the famous story of Tulip Mania in history:

 <center><h2>The Story of Tulip Mania</h2> </center>

Although the Netherlands is known for tulips, these flowers were not originally from there. They were imported from the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century. Later in 1592, a French pioneering botanist Carolus Clusius wrote the first major book on tulips, which made this flower so popular that his garden was raided, and people kept stealing  the bulbs. 

Tulips became more and more popular as the Dutch Golden Age grew. It's a common subject in paintings and festivals at that time. In the mid-seventeenth century, as a result of buying up bulbs, the tulips were getting so expensive that they were used as money until the market crashed. They even created the first economic bubble in history, known as "Tulip Mania". 

Today, "Tulip Mania" is often used to refer to a large economic bubble when the asset price deviates from the intrinsic value. Sounds familiar? Yep, some people compare the #cryptocurrency mania or #bitcoin craze to "Tulip Mania". Of course there is also voice against this view. I'm not an expert on this, but time will tell.

Since my post is inspired by the *White is White Contest* by @dmcamera, and the *“A City A Story” Photo Contest* by @aaronli, I will stick to only white flowers here. In my future post about travel tips to this garden, I'm going to include more pictures from Keukenhof.  All photos by me with my old friend Canon Kiss X3 and lens EF-S 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM. 

Enjoy these white beauties! =) 

Which photo or flowers do you like the most? Have you heard about the story of "Tulip Mania"? Feel free to share your comments below! Until next time. :D

这是我拍的一组以白色花朵为主题的照片。其中第二、三两张里的白玫瑰和白雏菊都挺常见，而第一张白色郁金香比较少见，所以介绍一下。这是在荷兰库肯霍夫的花卉公园里拍的，位于阿姆斯特丹和海牙之间的利瑟市。

郁金香有3000多种，颜色也很多样。白色郁金香在西方的婚礼上常被用作新娘的捧花。 不只在荷兰本土的很多地方能看到大量郁金香，在其他一些地方比如纽约，也有郁金香花节。这是因为早期荷兰移民抵达纽约时，把这些花的球茎也一起带了过去。纽约最初的名字是“新阿姆斯特丹”，可见这里与荷兰深厚的渊源。 

历史上有个有名的“郁金香泡沫”事件。虽然荷兰以郁金香之国闻名，但是这种花却是16世纪时从奥斯曼帝国引进荷兰的。引进后不久，1592年，一名先锋植物学家写了本关于郁金香的书，使这种花大受欢迎，他自家的花园也因此屡遭劫掠，很多人想方设法偷窃郁金香的球茎。

随着“荷兰黄金时代”的发展，郁金香也越来越受追捧，成为那一时期绘画和节庆的常见主题。到了17世纪中期，郁金香球茎的价格被哄抬为天价，是一名普通手工艺者年收入的很多倍。以致于郁金香球茎一度被当作货币使用，最后市场终于崩溃，导致历史上第一例经济泡沫的产生，被称为“郁金香泡沫”。

如今，当资产价格偏离了内在价值导致经济泡沫时，人们也常用“郁金香泡沫”来称呼。是不是听着耳熟？没错，有不少人也把加密货币或比特币引发的热潮比作“郁金香泡沫”。当然也有人持有不同观点。我不是这方面的专家，但是时间自会给出结论。


因为这篇文章参加“白花”主题的摄影活动和月旦评摄影，所以我没有贴很多库肯霍夫公园的其他色彩斑斓的鲜花，以后我会在关于旅游攻略的帖子里再一起分享。


你最喜欢什么花呢？听说过“郁金香泡沫”吗？欢迎留言评论。下次见！=）
