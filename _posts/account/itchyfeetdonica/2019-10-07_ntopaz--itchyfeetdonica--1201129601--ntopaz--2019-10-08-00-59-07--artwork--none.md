Greetings everyone! Have you ever tried Colombian style BBQ? 
When I traveled through the country, I found this delicious treat pretty common as street food, and it's also enjoyed at local homes or as picnics. They usually grill potatoes, meat, plantains, corn... and the ubiquitous arepas of course! So I devoured the bbq every time when I caught it on the street or in a restaurant. I was even invited by some local families to eat with them when I walked past their yards. Oh how I love Colombia (and solo travels as well)! =)

I saw the man making bbq in Zipaquirá, close to Bogotá, on my way to visit the underground Salt Cathedral. His cool hat, the traditional sombrero vueltiao from Colombia reminds me of a photo of myself taken at the Botero Plaza of Medellín. Earlier, I was looking at one sculpture by the Colombian national treasure artist Fernando Botero, who donated those famous "fat" artworks for the museum there. One hat vendor suddenly came to me, and put one hat on my head, pointing to that sculpture: "Why don't you take a photo with this cool sombrero on?" He had 2 dozens of sombreros in his hands, with their national tri-colors on each of them, just like all those silly but fun souveniors for tourists. We both laughed. So here it is, my picture with the sombrero vueltiao! :)

I also like the monochrome one. What do you think? Which one do you prefer?

Here's the original size of the head image before it's cropped by the site, taken with iPhone 7 at the end of 2016. My post is inspired by @worldcapture's People Photography.

我在哥伦比亚波哥大附近的地下盐教堂旁看到一家地道的哥式烧烤，摊主头戴极具本国特色的宽檐帽，让我想起自己曾在麦德林被帽子小贩戴上一顶宽檐帽的经历。
