I took this photo in a primitive tribe in the Omo Valley of Ethiopia, not far from the border with Kenya. The living environment was pretty harsh there. Like the other girls in the tribe, these 2 sisters decorated themselves with bright-colored beads. 

Eyes speak a thousand words, and there are even 2 pairs of eyes in the picture. ;) Plus a picture is worth a thousand words. So here we go, 3000 words! Enough for today.

跟上篇一样，参加人像摄影活动，拍于埃塞俄比亚南部一原始部落。

突然想到下面这首十几年前听到的歌，跟照片没关系，只是都有两个姑娘。很喜欢The Ditty Bops这个组合，每首歌都百听不厌。可惜几年前就不活跃了。

P.S. 刚看有评论说到“自由飘荡的灵魂”，一想莫非还真有点关系：唱这歌的一对女同无视世俗偏见，最终结了婚； 而这部落的两姐妹也是活在现代社会之外。大概都算勇敢？

This song suddenly came to my mind. It has nothing much to do with my photo except for there are also 2 girls in the band.

P.S.  One comment below has left me thinking that they could have something in common: 
The 2 sisters live out of the modern society, and the lesbian couple from the music band is also alternative. So both nonmainstream and courageous?

**The Ditty Bops - Because We Do**

*from the album Summer Rains, 2008*


>As the world starts to fade
I'll turn on the Rose Parade
Watch my troubles float away as the petals fly

>I could march to my own drum
But I'm twiddling my thumbs
And we like it because we do

>At school I learn to pray
And to keep my thoughts at bay
Follow leaders, follow orders
Follow other people's dreams

>This is where it all began
Here I sit when I should stand
And we like it because we do

>And we like it because we do

>The greatest prize to behold
It is life it can't be sold
But my eyes are set on gold

>They mock us when they sing
So we trade them for a ring

>And we like it because we do...
