Hello Steemians! Have you ever watched the old movie Popeye starring Robin Williams? Do you know where the film set is? 

The answer is... Anchor Bay, Malta! As you can see from this picture, the Popeye Village consists of colorful rustic wooden houses and pathways. It was designed by Danish architect Hans Munk Hansen. So it’s also called Danish Village or Sweethaven Village.

Today it is converted into an attraction fun park and it is open to the public as an open-air museum. There are shows and rides, as well as play houses where children can climb and explore the village. You may also get to meet the main characters from the show such as Popeye, Olive Oyl, Bluto and Wimpy. In some of the houses, you can find props used in the film's production.

If you visit this place, don’t miss the chance of taking a twenty-minute boat trip around Anchor Bay, so you can view the village from the sea. If you want to try diving, this is also a great spot for it!
