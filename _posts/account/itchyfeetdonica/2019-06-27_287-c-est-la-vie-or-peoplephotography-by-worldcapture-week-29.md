Greetings everyone! I took this photo in the medina of Fez, Morocco. At first, the Arabian camels' heads drew my attention. When I got closer, I found the butcher worth a shot too. What do you think was in his mind at the moment?  

It's my entry to the People Photography contest by @worldcapture and the #monomad contest by @monochromes. Thank you!
