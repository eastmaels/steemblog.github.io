<h2>Project Details</h2>
## 
Quasar is an MIT licensed open-source framework. It helps web developers create various responsive websites/apps without additional heavy libraries like Hammerjs, Momentjs or Bootstrap. 

This framework 
>allows developers to write code once and simultaneously deploy as website (SPA, PWA, SSR + SPA client takeover, SSR + PWA client takeover), Mobile App and/or Electron App using the same code base.

## 
Before I started the translation of Quasar Framework Documentation, I first read it through in GitHub. After I checked out their website, I joined their Discord channel to see what is ongoing about the project at the moment. I know, I didn't even do so much stalking when I had a crush on someone in my teenage years. ;) But I always believe doing some homework will be helpful for the translation. 

So I found its documentation clearly structured and completely crafted. With this piece, we would learn about Open Source and best-practices to make sure that the contributions are compliant. It includes an introduction of the basic terms like copyright, licensing and attribution; knowledge of the identity and rights of contributors; and content about different license types, such as licenses for code, for text, for fonts, and for artwork/design/video. 

This project is interesting to me, since I work with developers and designers. Plus, I have experience in translating IP documents and selling my photography works, so the legal terms in this documentation look familiar. Hopefully my translation would help Chinese users utilize such leading-edge developer tools and techniques with less confusion.

**Translation Overview**

Quasar Framework Documentation is a new project consisting of 4453 words in a single file. No previous Chinese translation of it has been done, so I started from 0% and finished 1/4 in the first submission (see the screenshots below). It is my first contribution to this project. I have enjoyed the subject matter and the translation process with a complete context. :)

## 
**Languages**

I translate from English to Simplified Chinese.

## 
**Word Count**
