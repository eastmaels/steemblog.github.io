Hey, in this post I'm sharing some t-shirt prints that I found pretty interesting in my early travels (when I was basically curious of everything and even took pictures of t-shirts ;p). 

## 
I found this t-shirt hanging above a toilet door in a local restaurant in Vilnius, Lithuania:

What Iceland impressed me the most was not only its stunning nature and the sense of emptiness, but also the unique humor of its people:

The one below was taken in Salzburg, the first city I visited in Austria. But years later when I was in Australia, I didn't see any prints like "No Mozart in Australia"... :D

If you have traveled to Greece, you might have seen lots of donkeys as well. There is even a Casanova donkey here:

I believe I took a few photos of the famous "Same same but different" tees in Thailand or Laos long time ago, but couldn't find them anymore. 

What fun t-shirts prints did you notice in your travels? Feel free to share them in the comments! :)
