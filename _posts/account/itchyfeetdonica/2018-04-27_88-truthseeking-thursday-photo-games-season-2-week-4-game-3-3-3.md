## Win points from each @Photogames Star’s post, by correctly identifying the 3 truths and 3 lies!
### 
_The rules are below - but first, a reminder that you still have until Sunday at 6pm EST to [submit your ACTION photo for Thematic Tuesday](https://steemit.com/photogames/@photogames/photo-challenge-action-photography-season-2-week-4-game-2) to win big points towards the 110 SBD prize pool!_


[![Truthseeking Thursday](https://steemitimages.com/DQmb2yNDFXG8btoAGnEMYbBjKHH7icPA7wV4o8r4gGJWuaP/IMG_25481.jpg)](https://steemitimages.com/DQmb2yNDFXG8btoAGnEMYbBjKHH7icPA7wV4o8r4gGJWuaP/IMG_25481.jpg)

This is a photo I took on my trip in Africa. Can you figure out which of the following "facts" are the real ones?

### Three of these statements about the photo above are true:
###
1. I took this photo in Kenya, close to the Ethiopian border. 
2. I paid these girls for taking the photo. 
3. They invited me to dance with them, and I did. 
4. The focal length was 85mm.
5. The f-stop was 4.5. 
6. This photo was removed by Instagram right after I posted it. Oh how I love Steemit... 


## RULES & HOW TO PLAY
 
The rules for this game are simple. Look at the list of six “facts” about our photo. Three of those facts are true and the other three are false. Your job is to separate the facts from fiction and tell us which three things are true. Write your guess in the comments below, using this format: “True: 1, 2, 3”

1. Only *one* entry per person on each Photo Star's post
2. No editing of your guess - you have to commit!
3. For this game you have 2 days to play (till Saturday at 6PM EST / 11PM UTC).


## SCORING

- The following points will be awarded to the first six successful/closest truthseekers on each Photo Star’s post:
- 9 | 6 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1
- (Max points allowed per person for this game is 36)
- Winners will be added to the [Photo Games Leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VnKMwb1yhWkVplZ3cmBEOz42lP_X5nJOWyQ1Y8W5K9o/edit#gid=853598128)
