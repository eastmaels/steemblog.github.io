Greetings everyone! Following my previous post of [Spring is in the air!(1)](https://steemit.com/cn/@itchyfeetdonica/225-beautiful-sublime-sunday-spring-is-in-the-air-1-or) with loads of flower photos I took, here I'm sharing another type of spring flower - cherry blossom. It's my entry to Qurator's Photo Friday competition and Flamingirl's 🌸 FLOWER POWER PHOTO CONTEST. 

Do you know an obvious difference between the cherry flower and the plum/peach flower? As you can see from the emoji and my photos, cherry blossoms' petals have a cleft at the tip, while the other 2 don't. At least, this is some unique feature that I observe to tell them part. =) Besides, cherry blossoms have longer stems than peach blossoms, and plum blossoms literally have no stems as they grow out from the branch itself.

I found these trees near my home in Belgium during a cycling trip. They are full of gorgeous white to pink blossoms. Cherry blossoms have a short life of around two weeks, and are in full bloom in spring time, so they are a symbol of the spring and the fleeting nature of life.

When I was taking pictures of these flowers a few days ago, the blossoms already started to fall, so the ground under the trees was covered by a carpet of soft petals. One man working in his garden nearby saw me and greeted me: "Hey, are you from Japan? I believe these flowers are from Japan." :) 

I told him I'm not, but cherry blossom trees and their blossoms (Sakura) do play an important role in Japanese culture. Each spring, my friends who live in Japan would show me photos and videos of people enjoying Hanami (cherry blossom viewing) picnic party. During their national flower's bloom season, Japanese people celebrate this old tradition with friends, families and co-workers underneath the cherry trees. 

##
Do you have cherry blossom trees where you live? Are they in full bloom right now?
