If you think of Cuba, what icons does it conjure up? The mojito? Classic cars? Colorful streets? Che Guevara (even though he's Argentinean)?

Here I'm going to show you some images of another Cuban icon -  the cigars. To be exact, a tobacco farmer's rolling and smoking cigar. The head picture is my entry to the PeoplePhotography Contest by @worldcapture. 

## 
Cigar is believed by many to be originated from Cuba. It's not uncommon to see locals smoking cigar on the streets. It's an interesting experience for me to visit a tobacco farm in the Viñales Valley, situated in the west of Cuba. 

## 
In front of a hut, this man in my photos demonstrated how to hand roll cigars. I also tried smoking a bit afterwards. The earthy flavor with a smell of the soil was unforgettable.

Do you like smoking cigars? =) Have you visited Cuba and the tobacco farms in the Viñales Valley?
