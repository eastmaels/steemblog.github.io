One weekend I visited Sonoma Valley with my friends from San Francisco. This beautiful region in northern California is renowned for its winemaking. We toured around a winery there and tried different types of sparkling wine and tapas. Wonderful drinks and snacks, and great time accompanied by friends. The photo here is my entry for @ntopaz's Still Life Bodegon contest by @acostaeladio. What do you think of it? Looking tempting to you? :) 

## 
The definition of Bodegón from their page: 

>Bodegon, a still life photograph, is an artistic composition of several inanimate objects. Still life photographs can be represented with immobile natural materials, such as flowers, seeds, fruits and shells. Or use everyday elements made by man, such as kitchen utensils, work tools or ornaments, which is creating a boom among photographers. Crayons, pencils, paints and 3D objects can be used to create good artistic drawings manually. The design software is also used as an artistic tool to create a good still life.

## 
>Mention the model of the camera or technique for the manual production or design process (include the step-by-step process).

## 
So I arranged the wine sampler and the tapas plates on the table and shot this photo from above. Here’s the info of my camera and settings:
