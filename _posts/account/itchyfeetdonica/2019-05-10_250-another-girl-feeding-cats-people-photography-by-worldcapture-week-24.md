What's up fellow Steemians! Here are some photos I took last week in Chefchaouen of Morocco. The head image is my entry for the People Photography contest by @worldcapture.   

This little girl was feeding a bunch of stray cats at a street corner, and I couldn't help recording her sweetness. Chefchaouen is a very touristic town as I expected. Honestly, I was not really impressed by its so-called dreamy blue, but the little heart-warming moments like this made the trip worth it. 

To show you the girl feeding the kittens and the famous blue-painted old town of Chefchaouen, I'm also posting the other 2 pictures of her I shot that day. Hope you enjoy them like I did! :)

这是我上周在摩洛哥北部的舍夫沙万拍到的当地小女孩喂猫的场景。舍夫沙万是有名的蓝色小镇，最近几年在Ins等图片社交媒体上火到不行，极度商业化也是意料之中，但因为正好位于南下途中，就拨出一天来经过体会一下，果然十分聒噪。;) 什么“蓝色的梦幻”倒真没觉得，而这些街头偶遇的温馨却让我不虚此行。

想起前年刚加入Steem时发过另一个小女孩喂猫的照片，一个在土耳其，一个在摩洛哥，一东一西，同为穆斯林国家，同为街角暖心的小女孩。=)

I named it "another girl" because it reminds me of the similar scene I captured before in Turkey. I posted the "Syrian Girl Feeding a Cat" in 2017 when I just joined Steem:  

>I’ve traveled quite extensively to over 60 countries and have taken numerous candid street photos, and this one remains one of my favorites. I was walking on a street in Istanbul that day and captured this beautiful loving moment. The street vendor nearby told me this is a Syrian refugee girl who is sometimes seen begging for food on that street, and I was lucky to witness her feeding a cat with the food she just got.
