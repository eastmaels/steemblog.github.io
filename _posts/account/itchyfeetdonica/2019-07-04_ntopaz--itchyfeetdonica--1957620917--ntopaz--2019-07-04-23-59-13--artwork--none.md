Greetings everyone! I'd love to share with you the stunning sunset at Whisky Bay, a quiet stretch of sheltered beach inside the most southern national park in Australia - Wilsons Promontory National Park in Victoria. 

After we drove to the car park in the heavy rain and walked through a moist gully and sand dunes, we arrived to this secluded beach. Luckily, the sun came out then and started to set. It's a perfect moment to watch the amazing scene, when the clouds in the sky and the huge rocks at the beach were gifted such dramatic colors. 

It's my third entry to the Golden Hour Photography Contest hosted by @ntopaz and @tussar11. My first two entries are respectively of a forest and the mountains. So now I'm entering this seascape in the golden hour. Hope you enjoy the brilliant view like I did. :)
