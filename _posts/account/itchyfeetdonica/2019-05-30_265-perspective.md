Hey, what's up fellow Steemians? Inspired by @portraitcontest's weekly theme - Perspective, I'm now posting a few pictures taken in my travels as entries. They are just some crappy phone shots in pretty low quality, but I hope you get the idea and feel the fun! :)  

First, a portrait of a skier and a snowboarder from my last skiing trip in the Austrian Alps, with some strange Perspective: ;)

And two pictures of me by the desert oasis of Huacachina, Peru:

One of those fun Perspective shots in the famous Uyuni flats in Bolivia:

I once posted [a video](https://steemit.com/dtube/@itchyfeetdonica/asika0c8) with the same group goofing around in Chile's Atacama desert,  in which we also played with Perspective:

At last, let's enjoy a song that just pops into my head:  =)

**On the Road Again**
Willie Nelson

>On the road again
I just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again

>On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again
And I can't wait to get on the road again

>On the road again
Like a band of Gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turnin' our way
And our way 

>On the road again
I just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
And I can't wait to get on the road again

<br />
