### Sweet Prayer Plant |  甜味祈祷草

It is native to western part of Africa, and is now also commonly seen in tropical Asia. I saw this plant in the wild and in some gardens in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia... Its large papery green leaves are popular for decoration purpose. 

这种植物原产于西非，现在在亚洲的热带地区也很常见。我在马来西亚、新加坡、印尼等国的野外和花园里都见过它们的芳踪 =)。它绿油油的大叶片赏心悦目，在家里庭院里都是很美的装点。

And the leaves are used for wrapping and boiling foods, like banana leaves. Local people also use them as weaving materials, building materials, and for roofing. 

就像大芭蕉叶一样，人们也用这祈祷草的大叶片包裹并烹煮食物。它还被用来作为编织、建筑和房顶材料。

Plus it’s a natural source of thaumatin, a low-calorie sweetener and flavor modifier protein.

此外，它还含有奇异果甜蛋白，是一种天然低热量的甜味剂。

Its leaf sap can also be used as sedative and as antidote against venoms, stings, and bites. 

叶子的汁液还被用作镇静剂和动物叮咬的解毒剂。

### Rice Plant | 水稻 

Rice is nice.  As a cereal grain, rice is rich in nutrients, vitamins, and minerals and is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's population, especially in Asia. 

水稻这种谷物富含营养素、维他命和矿物质，是世界上30多亿人口，尤其是亚洲人的主食。

There are so many ways of cooking and eating rice, and they are easy and tasty, such as steamed plain rice, with coconut milk, with saffron, with spinach juice or whatever vegetable sap; boiled into congee/porridge; fried rice with whatever vegetables and meat in your fridge (titled as Fried Rice Queen by my coworkers, I have lots of  recipes to share with you in future ;p); stuffed in vine leaves for Greek Dolmades; rolled in sushi; crispy rice crust; rice cracker... the list goes on. 

烹饪米饭的方式多种多样，简单又可口，比如：最简单的蒸白米饭，可以混入椰子汁、藏红花或菠菜汁等各种蔬菜汁；煮成粥；和冰箱里的菜肉做成炒饭(我被同事们称作“炒饭女王”，有很多配方想跟大家分享，哈哈）；包在葡萄叶里做成希腊式小粽子；卷成各类寿司；煎成香脆的锅巴；做成米饼...... 

I eat rice almost every day, and miss it a lot if there’s only bread available. 😋

作为一枚生活在西方世界被各式面包围攻的亚洲吃货，米饭这一底线却从未被突破。; )

What about you? Do you love rice? How do you normally cook it? Please tell me in the comments below. =) 

你们喜欢吃米饭吗？通常是怎么做的呢？
