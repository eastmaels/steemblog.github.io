This is Valle de la Luna (Moon Valley) in the Atacama Desert region of northern Chile. Its barren terrain is not so friendly for living, but I was totally smitten by its unique wild beauty when traveling there. Known for its moonlike landscape, this valley is located within Los Flamencos National Reserve.

The warm-toned rolling dunes, rugged mountains and special rock formations all attract visitors from afar. From the nearby town of San Pedro de Atacama, you can hike or bike along the trails leading to the valley.

Deserts are not so deadly dead as I imagined. ;) On the contrary, they are pretty enchanting. So after visiting some deserts in different parts of our beautiful earth, I have been charmed to crave for more (despite being deadly burned ;p). And I'm going to the Sahara soon! Woohoo~ can't wait! 

What about you? Have you been impressed by deserts in your travels? What deserts do you recommend to travel to?
