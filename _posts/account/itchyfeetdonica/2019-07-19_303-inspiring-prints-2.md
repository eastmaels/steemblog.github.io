I saw these famous lines by Mark Twain printed on a wall of a travel agency in the famous travel destination in Croatia - Dubrovnik. 

I like the design in this corner, and a fun fact: I just arrived there by hitchhiking from Montenegro. I missed the last connecting bus that day since the schedule changed when summer just finished. So I didn't catch the trade winds in my sails, but caught a kind truck driver who was willing to give me a lift, after standing 3 hours in the scorching sun with a sign. It was a fun experience. 

Actually, why do I ramble so much? Trying to say that the agency did a good job in marketing? Trying to convey some sort of silly profound message about life? Or trying to argue this single-picture post is not "low effort" because it's a photo that I captured after going through lots of hardships?

I have no idea. Feel free to call it shitpost if you must.
