There's a mountain creek down there! We heard the babbling water sound when hiking along a narrow path next to some soaring cliffs in Picos de Europa. It was about 38 degrees in temperature, so the cool flowing stream was like a godsend. 

We immediately descended from a not-so-vertical drop to approach the creek. Time to enjoy the splashes! Dipping into the crystal clear water was truly refreshing and relaxing at the moment.   

If you like hiking in the wild nature, remeber to check out Picos de Europa one day! This wonderful national park is situated in northern Spain and has been designated a UNECO Biosphere Reserve. There are plenty of hiking routes in the park, and you will be surrounded by gorgeous limestone massifs, lush pastures and spectacular lakes and brooks. 

I especially love this Cares Route that runs along the Cares River from Poncebos to Caín in León. The "Divine Gorge" trail is about 12 kilometres long in total. It was a lovely peaceful hike and a feast to our eyes along the way!
