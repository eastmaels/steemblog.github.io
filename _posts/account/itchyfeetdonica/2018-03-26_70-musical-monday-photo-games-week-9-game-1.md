## ABOUT THE PHOTO

Honestly I take pretty shitty photos comparing to professional photographers, but I have a shitty excuse: I've used all my money in traveling, so I'm still using my old shitty camera (it's very light for traveling around though) from 9 years ago. But that won't affect the fact that I can offer endless shitty photos for your music matching talent, like this hoppy one: 
I encountered these cute guys on a road trip from Canberra to Victoria. A mob of around 10 kangaroos were hopping around on an open arid field between scattered trees and bushes. To me, this scene is as Australian as it can be. 
What do you think? Bring on your music, pleeeeese! :D 


## RULES & HOW TO PLAY
 
For _**MUSICAL MONDAY**_ we would like you to _**Share a song that best matches the picture.**_ What does our photo _sound_ like?

It could be lyrical or instrumental, operatic or screamo, but pick something that you think each Photo Star will like.

You can give us the song title or share a link to DTube, Youtube, etc. Links are great, but it’s okay to just write the title and artist if the song is easy to find, like “_Hey Jude_ by The Beatles,” (not “_Adagio for Clarinet II, opus 245_ by my friend who lives next door”).

1. Share your music in the comments of a Photo Star’s post.
2. Only *one* song per person, per post/photostar.
3. Remember that you’re appealing to the Photo Star who posted the photo (they will choose the winner).
4. For this game you have 2 days to play (Wednesday 6PM EST / 11PM UTC).
