When I was in southern Ethiopia, I visited a weaving cooperative where local weavers were producing cotton fabrics with colourful designs. The happy man in my photo was one of them. Seems he's enjoying his work a lot, and I was given permission to shoot some photos there. 

This Dorze village is located high up in the Guge Mountains, northwest of Arba Minch. The Dorze people are a small ethnic group known in Ethiopia for their skilled cotton weaving. 

It's my entry to People Photography Contest Week #30 by @worldcapture. Thank you! :)
