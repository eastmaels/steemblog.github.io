Hey fellow Steemians, how's your weekend? Yesterday I cooked Braised Pork with Tofu and Shiitake mushrooms. It's so delicious and I would love to share its recipe with you! So let's get started: 

## Ingredients
##
Except for the pork belly(or chopped ribs), shiitake mushrooms and tofu(the harder type), you will need these in the picture below. And also rice, cooking oil, sugar, and sesame(optional, for the garnish on rice at last).

##
## Flame on! 
## 
-  First, sauté sugar in cooking oil over medium heat until it's turning brown. 
-  Put pork into the wok and fry it with the brown sugar to get colored. 
-  Add Chinese cooking wine, and stir fry pork with sliced ginger and star anise. 
-  Leave the pork being cooked for 10 minutes, meanwhile slice shiitake mushrooms and cube tofu. 
-  Add shiitake, tofu, soy sauce and salt into the wok. (🌶I looove chilies, but they are optional of course) 
-  Stir fry everything on high heat for 1 minute.
-  Add a bit water and cover the wok with lid, let it braise over low-medium heat for 10 minutes.

-  Enjoy this succulent pork dish with jasmine rice! 😋

## 步骤：
先炒糖色，入五花肉上色，加入料酒、姜片和大茴，翻炒10分钟左右。同时香菇切片、豆腐切块，加入锅中和肉、酱油、盐一起翻炒均匀（爱吃辣的加干辣椒😁🌶），最后沿锅边加点水，焖10分钟左右。香菇豆腐红烧肉就做好啦。赶紧出锅享用这绝世佳肴吧！😋

## 
## Behind the scenes: 
When I went to the back yard to cut chives, this cow suddenly came close and started mooing... He might be mouth-watering over the divine dish. ;)
After lunch on Sunday, I turned the left rice into porridge, and ate it later with the leftover pork for dinner. Yuuummmm...  


## 幕后花絮：
左图 —— 我去后院剪小葱时，只见这头奶牛凑将过来，朝我叫唤了几声，估计是被锅中焖着的红烧肉给吸引过来的？😄
右图 —— 星期天中午吃剩的米饭，加水煮成黄瓜粥，就着吃剩的香菇豆腐红烧肉和自制辣椒酱，简直是人间美味啊......
