This elderly man was walking in front of me in the medina of Tétouan, Morocco. He's wearing a Fez hat and a traditional long robe djellaba which is commonly seen in the Maghreb region of North Africa.

This type of robe is usually made of either cotton for summer wear or coarse wool for the winter. I've frequently seen flocks of sheep when traveling in the surrounding Atlas mountains where the wool is typically obtained. 

The baggy hood with a point at the back can protect the wearer from the sun, the snow and rain or the sand blown by strong desert wind. 
 
It's not a typical street fashion by an urban youth (though in recent years quite a lot of designers have been inspired by these robes to create modern kaftans), but this local man in the traditional wear just blends perfectly with the charming old streets. What do you think?  

The head image is my entry to @worldcapture's People Photography Contest week #24. Below is the photo in original colors joining the @portraitcontest themed Fashion.

漫步在摩洛哥北部山城得土安的老城区，看到前面这位当地老人，手里提着刚从旁边的菜市场买来的食材，身穿起源本国的北非传统长袍，头戴平顶菲斯圆毡帽，跟周边的老街和谐地融为一体。

这种长袍通常有冬夏两种，夏天穿的由轻薄的棉布做成，冬装的原料是粗糙些的羊毛，来自周边的阿特拉斯山区，我在山里走时常常能看到成群的绵羊和牧羊人。上面连着的宽大尖帽子可以遮阳挡雨、御寒防沙，在这离沙漠不远的气候多变的山区很实用。

不少国际知名的服装设计师，尤其是法国人（摩洛哥曾是法国殖民地），从这类北非传统长袍中汲取灵感，创新出更多款式的现代版长袍长裙，在时装界挺受欢迎。
