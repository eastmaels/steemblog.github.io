What's up fellow Steemians! Here is my last entry for the 7 DAYS PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHY CONTEST by @flamingirl. I resteemed her contest post earlier,  check it out and join the photo fun! =)

I clicked this shot at a local market in the south of Ethiopia. I visited this interesting market near the village Turmi, and encountered this woman from Hamar/Hamer tribe, a semi-nomadic, pastoral community best known for their distinctive style and bull-leaping ceremony. They have elaborately rolled hair in red ochre and beef tallow, and are wearing beautiful beaded necklaces and metal bracelets. It's said that they are fond of the accessories made of shells, which they trade at these markets brought over from Kenya.

To prove this is my photo work as required by the hostess, here's another photo of the same lady:

And a picture I took of other 2 girls at the market:

Here's another Hamar woman I posted before, but in front of her home, not from the same market. The marital collar on her neck indicates that she is the first wife, just like the woman on the left from the photo above. And you can see from the head image - that woman is not a first wife without the special collar. I know, it sounds a bit crazy right? Like in many tribes, the men here can marry multiple women, as long as they have enough cows to pay the bride price.

大家好！今天分享的几张照片是在埃塞俄比亚南部Omo山谷地区拍的。当时我在Turmi村附近的一个传统露天市集闲逛，看到这些Hamar部落的姑娘。

Hamar是一个有着独特审美风格的半游牧部族，族里成年男人的跳牛仪式远近闻名。女人们的传统发型很特别，头发被搓成很多细小的发束，掺和进红土和牛油来染色加固。身上佩戴着颜色鲜艳的串珠项链和金属手镯。

据说族人很钟爱贝壳制成的饰品，因为埃塞俄比亚本国不产贝壳，物以稀为贵，他们不惜花高价从邻国肯尼亚进口，其实就是用他们认为值钱的东西去以物易物，在这样的土产市集上换取贝壳制品。

最后两张曾在不同的主题帖子里发过，但从穿戴打扮来看，这里的四个女人都是来自同一个部族。最后这一张里抱小孩的妈妈，还有上面一张左边的女人，都戴着独特的金属粗项圈，表明她们是第一任妻子。而题图里的女人戴着普通的金属项圈，应该是已婚但非首任妻子。第三张照片里右边的姑娘没有带项圈，所以应该还是未婚。 没错，这个原始部落的男人就是这么任性，想娶几个娶几个，只要拥有足够多头牛当聘礼......
