Colca Canyon is one of the most impressive places that I visited in Peru. It is located in the southern part of the country, and is less visited than some other better known star sights. 

The canyon here is claimed to be the deepest one in the world, almost twice as deep as the Grand Canyon in the US. When I was hiking in the canyon, the stunning views and the high elevation kept taking my breath away.

The majestic high mountains and snow-capped volcanoes were shrouded in mist; the crystal clear creek were flowing at the bottom of the deep canyons; and the condors were soaring above my head. 

Deep in the mountains, the Inca traditions here are little altered. The locals still cultivate the pre-Inca stepped terraces built into the slopes.

This is my entry for Qurator's Photo Friday competition. Feel free to join the fun! :)
