Greetings everyone! Here's my shot of 2 monks at Phnom Bakheng near Siem Reap of Cambodia. It's my entry for @daveks' B&W Photo Contest themed **Colour Splash**. 

>Definition: The process of converting photos to monochrome, while keeping chosen details in colour.

When I saw this cool theme, the first images came to mind were the ones of monks in orange robe and dark grey temples. So I digged out this one I took in Angkor, and played with some color splash fun. :) I feel the bright-orange color of their robes forms a great contrast with the monochromatic towers and background. It's also interesting to catch the young dynamic monks and the old static towers in one frame. 

What about you? Have you tried applying "color splash" before? What kind of images do you think are suitable for this touch?

Now a bit more info about the temple. =) Phnom Bakheng is located a bit north of Angkor Wat and south of Angkor Thom. Because it's on the highest hill in the area, it's been long attracting visitors for the sunset view over Angkor Wat. However, I was here during noon time, oops... so no sunset view but only a scorching fire ball right above my head... Hmmm, while the scene of these young monks in bright robe by the ancient temples is equally amazing, isn't it? 

Phnom Bakheng, the architectural treasure is the state temple of the first Khmer capital in the Angkor region. As one of the oldest temples in Angkor Archaeological Park, it is a temple mountain built at the end of the 9th century in honor of the Hindu god Shiva. 

It sits on a rectangular base and rises in five levels. After climbing some steep stairs (the stairs were not that many, but the heat and humidity in the jungle made it pretty hard), I took this photo at the top level where it's crowned by five main towers. These five sandstone sanctuaries stand in a quincunx pattern — one in the center and one at each corner of the level’s square. They were all in repair, and most of the original 108 small towers around the temple at different tiers had already collapsed.

各位朋友周末好~ 今天分享的是关于柬埔寨巴肯寺的信息。题图的照片是我顶着炎炎烈日爬到寺庙顶层的平台后拍的，用“色彩喷溅”效果来突出僧人鲜亮的黄（或者是橙色？）袍，和周遭单色的环境形成对比。同时，我赶脚这两位充满活力的小和尚和旁边饱经风霜、静静矗立千年的古塔们同框，也是挺有意思的画面。你觉得呢？:)

9世纪时，吴哥王朝国王耶输跋摩一世建都吴哥，在巴肯山上建立了这个印度教寺庙，用来供奉主神湿婆。巴肯寺是柬埔寨吴哥古迹中最古老的寺庙之一，也因为它在遗址群中的最高地势，成为很受游客欢迎的观日落地点。可惜我是正午时到的那里，只有一颗耀眼的大火球挂在头顶。虽然错过了看日落，但捕捉到这些年轻僧侣在古塔旁边的景象，我也很知足啦~
