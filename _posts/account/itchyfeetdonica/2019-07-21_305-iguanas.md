If you have been to the tropical areas of Latin America, you might have seen this genus of lizard in the wild. I spotted this iguana at the coast on the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico and shot these pictures. 

I immediately thought of this fellow when I saw @phortun’s Reptile photo contest. Since he’s based in Riviera Maya and I remember seeing his photos of iguanas. These lizards were quite common sights when I was visiting that region. Does this one look familiar @phortun? ;)

The genus includes 2 species: the green iguana which is a popular pet and the endangered Lesser Antillean iguana. Green iguanas are native to Central and South America, and their meat is a delicacy on some locals’ dining tables. 

While in Puerto Rico where I lived, they pose a threat to farmers by eating a large amount of their crops. Without any predators on the island, they become an invasive species. 

These big reptiles boast keen vision which enables them to locate food in long distance and to communicate with other members.

And here’s the closeup of another iguana. I saw it being kept as a pet on the island of Bali in Indonesia:
