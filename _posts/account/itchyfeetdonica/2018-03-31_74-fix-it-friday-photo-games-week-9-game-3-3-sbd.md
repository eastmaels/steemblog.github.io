## ABOUT THE PHOTO
This is a photo I took at Humboldt Penguin National Reserve in a trip to the Pacific Ocean off the northern Chilean coast. (You see how #WhereisitWednesday kills me since I love telling people where I took all my photos!) 
I know you guys got kangaroos already on #MusicalMonday, but I just can't help offering you another cheerful creature. ;) So go get creative - edit this photo as you like, the choice is yours! Look forward to your sparks!
