Hi everyone! It's Tasty Tuesday time! I devoured a big bowl of Laksa last Sunday evening in the Chinatown ( only a short street) of Antwerp. It reminds me of those delicious Laksas I enjoyed in Malaysia and Singapore. 

##
上周日晚在安特卫普的唐人街吃了一大碗叻沙，让我想起在马来西亚和新加坡大饕叻沙的日子。叻沙是马来语Laksa的发音，是道起源于马来西亚的面食料理，相信大马和新加坡的朋友们肯定非常熟悉，因为这和椰浆饭、炒粿条等都是新马的美食代表，在那边的街头随处可见，主要有咖哩叻沙、亚三叻沙等口味。

In my picture above, it is a Laksa I had in 328 Katong Laksa on the East Coast Road of Singapore. In a 2013 cooking showdown, 328 Katong Laksa beat the celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay. This result surely made it even more famous. 

The Laksa was inspired by the Straits Chinese who live in the precinct of Katong. I quickly finished the aromatic seafood and rice vermicelli soaked in the spicy broth flavoured with coconut milk and dried shrimp. It tasted divine!

And I loved the Laksa from Toast Box, but I forgot to take pictures of the food there since I simply ate too many Laksas those days, so only a Laksa photo from the shop when I left: ;)

Though we can find Laksa easily in Malaysia and Singapore, it's rare here in Belgium. There are only 3 to 4 Malaysian restaurants in the whole country (I haven't tried the 4th one yet as I can't find any pictures of it online but only a name and address, would check it out one day), and not every one of them sells Laksa. Luckily Belgium is small in size, so I'm grateful to enjoy some hearty Asian meals occasionally without driving too far. :)

As for the precious Laksa here, it's normal that there's not a variety of choices like Nyonya Laksa, Johor Laksa, Sarawak Laksa, Penang Asam Laksa... but only the most common curry mee with coconut-based curry broth. I feel this is the more mild flavored Laksa comparing to other types I tried in Malaysia? Any Malaysian or Singaporean Steemians please correct me if I got it wrong.

As you can see from my photos, the toppings include prawns, fish cakes/balls, tofu puffs, bean sprouts, long beans, scallions, eggplants, and even char siu (Cantonese barbecue pork) pieces... It's rich and fragrant as always. Slurp, slurp, slurp~

I just found these pictures from my phone taken in Kuala Lumpur - similar noodle soup I had in the cafe restaurant chain Old Town White Coffee. It’s much cheaper and more spicy:
