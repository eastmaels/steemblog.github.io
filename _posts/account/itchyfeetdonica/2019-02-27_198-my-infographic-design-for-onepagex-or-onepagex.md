<h2>So what is OnePageX.com?</h2>

##
It is an amazing online tool to quickly convert cryptocurrencies! [OnePageX.com](https://onepagex.com) has over 140 cryptocurrencies listed. Besides, STEEM has been integrated as a base asset. It means that you can convert STEEM to any of the 140+ cryptocurrencies instantly! Great news for Steemians right?  :)

## 
If you have a website where you want to offer your visitors an altcoin converter, you can also try the [OneBox](https://onepagex.com/onebox).  It is easy to implement with a copy-paste of some code. The user never leaves your website, as everything happens inside the widget.

<h2>My Post-Design ;) Brief:</h2>

## 
After exploring their website and relevant info, I decided to make an infographic to show the step-by-step instructions on how to use OnePageX.com. Based on my marketing experience, this type of simple chart with how-to steps is nice and handy to share on social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest... and of course the blockchain social platforms! =)

## 
I first picked the background color from their website to apply as the canvas color for my infographic chart. To be in line with their site's minimal style and the brand colors, I limited the chart's colors into green, white and blue. 

And I put their logo and homepage picture in the up middle of the chart. For the screenshot, I chose Steem (Of course! Also its color is still in the blue family of the background color, though it's quite a distant relative... ;p) and BCHAB (mainly because of its green and white logo) as an exchange example. 

I threw in their catchy taglines and the website address (Traffic! Traffic! Traffic! ) too.  Then I summarised the 3 steps to use the site and visualized them with some icons. That's it! Easy peasy lemon squeezy~ :)

**My final design:**
