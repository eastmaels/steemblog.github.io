Hi fellow Steemians, this is my first entry for the Steemit Portrait Photography Contest Week 45 themed Sepia Toned Portraits.

I shot this photo in Taormina on the island of Sicily, Italy. After visiting the ancient amphitheater on the hilltop that day, I strolled to a port. These two kids were having fun in front of a shed by the water. They might be sister and brother from a family nearby. The girl was cutting some green leaves, perhaps for their "grand meal" of the day, and the little boy was preparing a pot to "cook". :) The golden sun rays were shining on the girl's hair, and the boy's smiling face was lit - a lovely scene I just couldn't help capturing with my camera. =)

To prove this is my photo work as required by the hostess, here's the same photo in colors and another photo of the two children:
