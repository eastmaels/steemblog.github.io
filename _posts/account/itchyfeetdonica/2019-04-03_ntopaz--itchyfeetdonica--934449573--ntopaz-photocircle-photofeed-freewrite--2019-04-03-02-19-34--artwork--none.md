Greetings everyone! I'm joining the portrait photo contest with the head picture I took in Sri Lanka. And here's another reason I chose the photo: I saw @mariannewest's Tuesday prompt for the 5 Minute Freewrite is GOLD. It reminds me of this cute little girl who dressed in goldish and stood in front of some goldish saree (see the second photo below). Plus her smile in the sun, together with her sweetness and intelligence made her shine like gold. :) 

It's my first time participating this Freewrite challenge, and I'm not sure if the paragraphs I'm writing in 5 minutes would meet the requirement. But it's fun to try. If you haven't known about this awesome daily writing challenge, feel free to check it out and join in too! 

So I met this GOLD girl during my travels in the tea country in Sri Lanka. I took a train from the capital city and had a few stopovers on my way. Her hometown is one of the villages I stopped by. Her mother was running a small guest house which was part of their own home. She was the youngest daughter in the family, and welcomed me when I arrived at their hillside home from the train station. She helped me register my passport info and showed me around their house. 

Her mother offered me some sweets and the local tea (of course ;)), and went on with her housework. So the little girl and I had a very pleasant conversation full of laughter, about her studies at school, the famous local tea, their village, my travels in her country and other random stuff. I know, seems I could enjoy talking with a 7 year-old as well as a 70 one. ;) On the wall of their living room, lots of her certificates of merit and event photos from school were displayed. Apparently she's a smart and talented girl. And it's proved soon. 

After I checked into my room, I found that the socket on the wall didn't work for charging. So I walked downstairs to tell the girl's mother about it. Before she replied, this GOLD girl came to the rescue. She grabbed a pencil and said:"Follow me." After a few attempts with the magical pencil, the socket worked again. Sweet, wasn't it?

Later, when I stepped out of the house for a walk in town, I saw her helping her mom put up the golden saree for drying. Hearing my steps, she turned around and smiled to me, standing in the sun, shining like gold.

大家好~ 这篇的照片用来参加人像摄影活动，是我在斯里兰卡的茶乡拍的。这个充满灵气的小姑娘是我入住的当地一户人家的小女儿，非常聪明可爱，跟我相谈甚欢~~没错，我跟上至70下至7岁的人都可以无话不谈;)~~，还用一支神奇的铅笔帮我修好了房间的插座。

文字部分的小故事围绕5分钟自由写作活动给出的当日主题“金”。上面英文有提到相关主办人，感兴趣的朋友也来参加吧！=)
