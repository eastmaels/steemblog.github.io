![ntopaz-image-0](https://artisteem.io/media/0e0850a7-2a1b-4c39-b9e8-2d472409b39d)In the winter of 2016, We came to Sanya, Hainan province. This is wuzhizhou island.

Here the beach is very white, the sky and the ocean are very blue, blue and white interwoven together clear and bright, constitute a beautiful picture, let persons relaxed and happy.

In the distance, a boat passed by , like a pearl in a picture scroll.

Occasionally the waves beat against the rocks on the shor，It reminds me of a song I often heard as a child, "Grandma's Penghu Bay". There is a popular Lyric like this，“Mild wind in Penghu Bay, waves're heating on the beach，There are nothing as decorations, but a blue sky and sea... Sunshine , beaches , waves , and ....” This song is the most appropriate way to describe this beautiful scene.

I used my cellphone HUAWEI NCE-AL00 for this photo.
