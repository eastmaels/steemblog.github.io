Normally, I could not remember who the actors are? Who is the director? Which company makes it? Just see more, will often find this actor also acted in other movies, but the name is often not called, especially the actress, seems to look the same, all the same beautiful, however for those who are not so beautiful, some characteristics of the actress to me are more impressive. The actor sees familiar, I also like to resemble kind of lovely and simple and honest appearance especially, sure enough, it is "my savage cummer".
我看电影不会刻意去记有哪些演员？导演是谁？哪家公司出品？只是看得多了，会经常发现这个演员也演过其他什么电影，而名字却往往叫不上来，特别是女演员，好像长得都一样，都一样的漂亮，反到是不那么漂亮，稍微有些特点的演员给我的印象更深刻。与神同行的男主就看得眼熟，我也特别喜欢像男主这种可爱憨厚的样子，果然，原来是《我的野蛮女友》中的男主。

It is difficult to describe what kind of this film belongs to. I think it is more about the philosophy of life than fantasy film, and more about family love and maternal love.
很难用几句话来形容这部影片属于什么类型，与其说是奇幻电影，我倒觉得不如说是讲人生哲学的电影，更不如说是讲亲情和母爱的电影。

The NO1 actor is a fireman, in a task unfortunately sacrifice, but his extremely important wishes have not been completed, the mother's guilt and concern, hidden in the heart for 15 years, so the actor extremely eager to return to the world. Due to the actor's integrity, he is designated as a "noble man" in the underworld, and the noble man has the opportunity to return to the earth, but he needs to go through the judgment of the court in the underworld, just like the court on earth, he has the right to defend as well as the charge of the plaintiff, and finally the king of hell decides whether he can return to the earth or not. The court of the underworld consists of seven trials, namely, betrayal, violence, ethics, murder, idleness, lying and injustice. The probability of safe passage of these seven trials is extremely low.
男主是一名消防队员，在一次执行任务时不幸牺牲，可是男主心中还有极其重要的心愿没有完成，对母亲的愧疚和挂念，在心中隐藏了十五年，所以男主极其渴望重返人间。由于男主品行正直，在阴间被定为”贵人”，贵人就有重返人间的机会，但需要历经阴间法庭的审判，就像人间的法庭一样，有判官的指控也有辩护的权利，最后由阎王裁定是否能重返人间。阴间法庭包括七大审判，分别是背叛、暴力、天伦、杀人、懒惰、谎言和不义，能安全通过这7个审判的概率极低。

Aren't these seven judgements the life philosophies that people are searching for and exploring? For example, lies, the actor have written 99 letters with lies, told his mother that his life is very happy and stable, but the actual situation is that he was bitten by a boar in task; He wrote some letters to his colleague’s daughter in the name of a colleague, encouraging and comforting the little girl to be strong and hard-working, actually his colleague had already died in the execution of the task. The actor told so many lies, it is very likely that he will not pass the judgment of the underworld. These lies, nevertheless, brings the expectation and hope, let the little girl had a vision for the future, let the sick mother do not need to worry about him, let the sick mother recovered, these are white lies, of course, a lie has unraveled, it is inevitable that the experience loss when a lie is puncture, but for their lives, have how old loss will be how to grow bigger. The actor successfully through the trial of lies.
这七大审判不就是让芸芸众生苦苦追寻和探究的人生哲理吗？比如谎言，男主曾写过99封带有谎言的信件，告诉母亲自己生活很幸福稳定，而实际却在执行任务时被野猪咬伤；以同事的名义给他女儿写信，鼓励安慰小女孩要坚强努力，但实际同事在执行任务时已经牺牲。男主撒了这么多的谎，很可能会无法通过阴间的审判。但是，这些谎言却给人带来了期待和希望，让小女孩对未来有了憧憬，让重病的母亲可以不为自己而费心，让重病的母亲得以康复，这些是善意的谎言，当然，谎言就有被戳穿的时候，当谎言被戳穿时难免要经历失落感，但是对于他们人生来说，有多大的失落就会有多大的成长。男主顺利通过谎言的审判。

Due to the guilt of the mother, the actor’s heart often blame and suffering, so for 15 years did not meet his mother. All the people in this world live with their SINS, and only some of them dare to show sincere courage to get forgiveness, and even fewer people can get true forgiveness. Mother forgave him, the actor also passed 7 trials finally, can return to the world.
男主由于对母亲的愧疚，内心常常自责并饱受煎熬，也因此有十五年未与母亲见面。这个世界上所有的人都背负着罪孽而活着，而只有一部分人敢于拿出真诚的勇气来获取原谅，而更少的人能得到真心的原谅。母亲原谅了男主，男主也最终通过了七大审判，得以重返人间。

Good profound a movie, the subject matter novel, the plot is touching, the story is compact, not only impresses the people, more let the person aftertaste is infinite, is worthy of is a masterpiece!
好深刻的一部电影，题材新颖，情节感人，故事紧凑丝丝入扣，不仅打动人心，更让人回味无穷，不愧是一部佳作！
