一部讲人性的电影《寄生虫》  《기생충》

I've heard about this movie for a long time. I finally found it. It is a thought-provoking realistic film about human nature.
早就听说过这部电影，找了很久终于找到了。这是一部讲人性的现实题材电影，发人深省。

Everyone has the desire for a better life, the pursuit of a better life. However, there are all kinds of differences between people, and everyone can't leave real life, can't leave a variety of strange social, and everyone is an individual. What is the root of the difference between people? Is appearance? Is wealth?
每个人都有渴望美好生活，追求美好生活的憧憬。但是人与人之间终究存在着各种各样的不同，每个人都离不开现实生活，都离不开千奇百怪的社交，而每个人又是一个独立的个体。人与人之间差异的根本又是什么呢？是相貌？是财富？

This is a very profound film. The film does not give an answer about the differences between people, but illustrates a truth through the story. Maybe everyone has his own different understanding.
这是一部很深刻的电影，影片并没有给出人与人差别的答案，而是通过故事在阐述这样一个道理，也许每个人都有自己不同的理解吧。

An ordinary family that lives in bottom society, although the day lives very hard, but the father that serves as a head still has dignity and majesty extremely in the home, an accidental opportunity lets whole family enjoy plutocrat's life, capacious and comfortable big house, sweet green lawn. But a good life always seems to be very short, and the father followed is facing the challenge of dignity, as a driver of rich family, the father felt can't follow one's inclinations any more, he had to be careful everywhere, and will still be in casual between "insult" by he understood, although also can have material to enjoy, but the father's heart was hurt, in the end, he picked up his knife and killed the rich.
生活在底层社会的一个普通家庭，虽然日子过得很艰苦，但作为一家之主的父亲在家里还是极有尊严和威严，一个偶然的机会让全家人享受到了富豪的生活，宽敞舒适的大房子，温馨绿色的草坪。可是美好生活好像总是很短暂，父亲随之而来面对的却是不曾有过的尊严的挑战，作为富豪家中的司机，父亲感受到再也不能像以往那样随心所欲，处处需要小心翼翼，但是仍然会在不经意之间受到他所理解的“侮辱”，虽然还可以有物质上的享受，但是父亲的心灵受到了伤害，最终，他还是拿起屠刀，杀死了富豪。

There are many conversations in the film that make you wonder, such as the whole family discussing whether being rich makes you easy to be deceived, or whether being kind makes you rich.
影片中还有很多对白也发人深思，比如全家人一起讨论是因为富有了，而变得善良容易被欺骗，还是因为善良才变得富有？

What is the root of differences between people? In this society, classes exist objectively, and which class one belongs to can be obtained through efforts. The differences in appearance and wealth between people are only superficial manifestations of differences, while the fundamental differences may lie in thoughts and thus belong to different classes.
人与人差异的根本究竟是什么呢？在这个社会里，阶级是客观存在的，属于哪个阶级是可以通过努力来争取的，人与人之间外貌的不同，财富的不同只是差异的表面体现，而根本差异可能在于思想，从而属于不同的阶级。

What if they belong to different classes? A person can finally grasp, perhaps only their own inner peace and tranquility.
即使属于不同阶级又能怎样呢？一个人最终能把握的，恐怕只有自己内心的平静和安宁吧。
