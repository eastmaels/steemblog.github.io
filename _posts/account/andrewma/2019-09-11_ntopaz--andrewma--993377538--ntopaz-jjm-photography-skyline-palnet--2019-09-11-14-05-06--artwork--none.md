![ntopaz-image-0](https://artisteem.io/media/53c7470c-72f1-4e33-a2ad-3dda0986c52f)This is the photo I took in the winter of 2014 on the cruise ship of pearl river in guangzhou.

On both sides of the pearl river are modern Chinese buildings, especially the new TV tower in guangzhou, which is known as "small waist". With a total height of 600 meters, it is the highest tower in China and the second highest tower in Asia.

Different from the ancient buildings on both sides of haihe river in tianjin, the pearl river is more of a modern flavor, which is the epitome of China's rapid development in decades.

I used my cellphone HUAWEI NCE-AL00 for this photo.
