The second part is much richer and more complex than the first; In addition, in the form of performance added a lot of big special effects and funny scenes.
第二部比第一部在故事情节上丰富了很多，也复杂了很多；另外在表现形式上增加了很多大场面的特技效果和搞笑场景。

The second story is divided into two parts, one is the continuation of the first story, the head of the messenger as a defender, continue to lead the first series of male Lord brother through the judgment of the underworld, for early reincarnation; The other part is the emissary of the day and the emissary of the moon who carry out the mission to bring the old people in the world to the grave.
第二部故事线索分为两部分，一部分是第一部故事的延续，使者的头儿作为辩护人，继续带领第一辑男主的弟弟通过阴间的审判，争取早日转世；另一部分是日间使者和月间使者执行任务，要把阳间的老人家带到阴间。

If the first one is about redemption, about reincarnation. So the second part is mainly about previous lives, about cause and effect. As the title of the film says, "cause and fate." Three emissaries in the past life took place more than a thousand years ago in the koryo period, the story between them can be sung and cry, love and hatred earthshaking. In fact, there are no bad people in the world, but there are bad situations. So when you complain, feel resentment, and could not understand, think about everything upside down, stand in the other side's point of view to think and interpret, may find the answer.
如果说第一部是讲救赎，讲如何才能转世。那么第二部主要是在讲前世，讲因果。正如影片名称所说的“因与缘”。三位使者的前世发生在一千多年前的高丽时期，他们之间发生的故事可歌可泣，恩怨情仇惊天动地。其实，世界上并没有坏人，只是存在很坏的情况。所以当你埋怨，感到愤恨无法理解时，把一切倒过来想一想，站在对方的角度来思考和解读，可能就会找到答案了。

Causal is that how deep and make people searching for and the philosophy of exploring. The film from the hero past the enmity of evolution to the present to help people through the judgment of the king of underworld, combined with himself and life experience and profound feelings, explain the causal relationship between a good, story is very excellent and very complex, deep expression in the two hours of film and vivid interpretation, I admire the control ability of the writer and director.
因果又是多么深刻而又让人苦苦追寻和探究的哲理，影片从主人公前世的恩怨情仇演变到当下帮助贵人通过阎王的审判，结合自己和贵人的亲身经历和深刻感受，很好的诠释了因果的关系，故事非常精彩也很复杂，能在两个小时的影片中深刻表达和生动诠释，不得不佩服编剧和导演的驾控能力。

Compared with the first film, the film also adds a lot of special effects, such as being hunted by dinosaurs, survival in the stormy waves and so on, is a feast of sight and hearing. The film also features a number of amusing scenes, such as poking fun at fund investments and concluding that buying a house or cryptocurrency are better than inveting fund. Let person could not help laughing.
影片较第一部还增加了很多特效场景，比如被恐龙追杀，惊涛骇浪中顽强求生等等，确是一场视听觉的盛宴。此外，影片还设计了不少的搞笑场景，比如调侃了基金投资，结论是不如买房子，也不如买加密货币。让人看后忍俊不止。

To some extent, it can be said that the second film surpasses the first one, which is more shocking in terms of content and performance. The film has also won many awards and is highly recommended.
在某种程度上，可以说第二部完成了对第一部的超越，从内容和表现形式上都更让人震撼，该片也获得很多奖项，强烈推荐。
