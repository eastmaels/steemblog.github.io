![ntopaz-image-0](https://artisteem.io/media/c4ad9bfa-df4a-48af-be71-fc229f49d194)![ntopaz-image-1](https://artisteem.io/media/dac89106-4bc5-4f70-b505-9c6e527d5729)![ntopaz-image-2](https://artisteem.io/media/d0381083-88ee-47ce-a26c-9edae7dd8f1e)When the lotus is in full bloom, it attracts a large number of photography enthusiasts to wait for it，capture the beautiful moment.

The attraction of the first picture is not only that the petals of the lotus leaf are fully unfolded, but also that a small bee is flying towards it，Do you see that?

In the second picture, the little bee has been quietly enjoying the fun and pleasure on the lotus leaf.

In the third picture, a small butterfly is also attracted by the blooming lotus.

Hope you like these.Thanks!

These photos were taken by Canon 700D.
