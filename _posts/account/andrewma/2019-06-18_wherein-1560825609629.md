《加密货币》 《Crypto》

I saw the movie because it was called cryptocurrency.
因为影片名字叫加密货币，所以看了这部电影。

After watching it, I felt quite ordinary. The actor is an anti-money laundering employee of a bank. During his work, investigations found that there were Russian gangsters who used the accounts opened in the bank to buy bitcoin and conduct money laundering activities. Finally, in the actor and the joint efforts of the FBI, destroyed the gang's illegal behavior, and male protagonist's direct boss because of the profit in this illegal action, was arrested by the police.
看完之后感觉很一般，男主是一家银行的反洗钱员工，在工作中调查发现，有俄罗斯黑帮利用在该银行开立的账户购买比特币，并进行洗钱活动。最终，在男主和FBI的共同努力之下，摧毁了黑帮的违法行为，并且男主的直接上司因在此非法行动中获利，被警方逮捕。

Maybe because the story itself is monotonous, the scriptwriter also designed the plot of contradiction between the actor and his family, but the contradiction is mainly presented through dialogue, which is not very profound. There is a good friends of men, in order to find money laundering clues and exposed himself, and was brutally killed by the gang, because this friendship does not have a deep foundation, so for friends to sacrifice their own behavior is not easy to get resonance. Still have the female director of the gallery that is used by gang, the affection that expressed to actor advocate inexplicably is also not quite can be understood. There are other parts of this plot that cannot resist scrutiny.
可能是因为故事本身比较单调，编剧另外设计了男主家庭矛盾的情节，但矛盾主要靠对话来展现，不是很深刻。还有男主的好朋友，为了寻找洗钱线索而暴露了自己，因而被黑帮残忍杀害，由于这种友谊没有深刻的铺垫，所以为朋友牺牲自己的行为也不太容易得到共鸣。还有被黑帮利用的画廊女主管，莫名其妙地表达了对男主的爱慕之情也是不太能够被理解。诸如此类的情节还有一些地方，都禁不住深刻推敲。

If the film is only encrypted currency, the plot is not enough plump, content is monotonous, so the writers arrangement design again some other plot, but the content of the increase is not very good complete show, and the story line contact and the weak, will certainly affect the feeling of the audience, I think this is the film's biggest failure.
影片如果仅仅表现加密货币，故事情节还不够丰满，内容也比较单调，所以编剧又安排设计了一些其他情节，但是增加的内容又没有很好的完整的展现，和故事主线的联系又比较牵强，肯定会影响观众的感受，我觉得这是本片最大的败笔。
