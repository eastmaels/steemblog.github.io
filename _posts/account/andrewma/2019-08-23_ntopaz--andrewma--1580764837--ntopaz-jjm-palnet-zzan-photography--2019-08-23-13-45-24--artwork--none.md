![ntopaz-image-0](https://artisteem.io/media/133453b5-c748-4a7c-a2c2-95bd5b07c67c)This is yalong bay in hainan province.

In the winter of 2016, we came to sanya, hainan province. Our hotel is just opposite yalong bay. From the balcony of our hotel room, we can see the whole yalong bay to the greatest extent.

Ocean, beach, tropical woods, spacious road, hotel, perfect to form a picture scroll.Through different levels and colours.The beach becomes a link between blue and greenï¼ŒBring the ocean and green plants together perfect.

I took this picture with a spherical lens that I connected to my phone. The entire image forms a sphere, turning the most chan visible to the naked eye. 

I used my cellphone HUAWEI NCE-AL00 for this photo.
