Firstly, Congrats to the new MVP Giannis! 

Be honestly,I feel a little disappointed because  James Harden could not achieve the rewards.

Below is the result of Harden.

1、Averaging 36.1 points per game in his greatest season since Jordan!
2、1st player in NBA history to avg at least 35.0ppg & 7.0apg in a single seaon
3、Scored 40+ pts 28 times this season,50+ 9 times and 60+ twice
4、Finished Top 2 in MVP voting 4 out of the last 5 seasons.

Hope Harden will be stronger next year, can lead the Rockets to the NBA championship.
