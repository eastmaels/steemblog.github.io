After posting more than 300 posts,I sometimes confused that what kind of contents I  usually prefer to share,and how about my steem rewards.

I was tolded by @ericet, there is one website https://steemworld.org, This website not  only could show the rewards ,but the account operations in real time.

That is so cool! How  great the blockchain and steemit are! Thanks ericet!

Besides analyzing the rewards,I also want to analyze the contect of my posts,such as how  the signs use ,what contents I post must more and so on. I am not sure if you also have  this requests? and I think maybe this tool could occur soon.
