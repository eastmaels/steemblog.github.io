![ntopaz-image-0](https://artisteem.io/media/bccd3abf-354a-424a-ba78-6e37069bbd7b)It took my eldest son two days to finish the painting, which was just a decorative painting made with black and white.

The painting looks like a headdress of a Chinese minority, and at the same time it looks like the facial makeup of an ancient Chinese Peking Opera.

This is a very characteristic traditional Chinese art painting.

I used my cellphone HUAWEI NCE-AL00 for this  photo.
