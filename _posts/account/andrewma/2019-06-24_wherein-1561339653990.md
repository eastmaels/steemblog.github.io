《羞辱》  《수모 를 당》

This is a thought-provoking and thoughtful film.
这是一部发人深省，而且有内涵的影片。

A Palestinian refugee in Lebanon who is a construction company contractor, a serious and responsible worker, In an overhaul he found a household sewer problems, suggest the owner of the owner to repair, but was outrageous refusal, contractor scolded him a similar "idiot" words, the story began.
一位巴勒斯坦难民在黎巴嫩的一家建筑公司做包工头，工作认真负责，在一次检修中发现一家住户的下水道有问题，建议住户主人维修，但遭到主人的蛮横拒绝，包工头骂了他一句类似“傻逼”的话，故事就此展开。

The owner, who is a Christian, demanded that the contractor apologize in person, but when face to face, the Christian said an insult that the Palestinian refugees could not bear. Instead of apologizing in person, the contractor broke two ribs, and the contractor was sued by the christians.
住户主人是基督徒，要求包工头必须当面道歉，但是在面对面时，这位基督徒又说了一句让巴勒斯坦难民无法忍受的侮辱的话，不仅没有得到当面道歉，反而被打断了两根肋骨，于是包工头被基督徒告上了法庭。

It is not so much a lawsuit over humiliation as an ethnic conflict between Lebanese christians and Palestinian refugees over historical reasons
与其说是由于羞辱引起的一场官司，不如说是黎巴能基督徒和巴勒斯坦难民之间由于历史原因引起的一场民族冲突。

Depressing to think, for the full 120 minutes, As the plaintiff and defendant, the Palestinian refugees and the Lebanese christians completely let go in the hint of a smile at one another, the accused was acquitted, the plaintiff also relieved, shake hands with friends, not guilty decision is a victory for both the plaintiff and the defendant, the plaintiff from extreme hate Paris Stan refugees even interrupted two ribs, to help the Palestinian refugee to repair his car, moved by her daughter was born, see the growth of new life, is also a profound self-salvation; Innocent verdict actually means that people are innocent. In war, people are always the most innocent and hurt the most.
压抑思索了整整120分钟，在最后被告和原告，巴勒斯坦难民和黎巴嫩基督徒之间淡淡的相视一笑中彻底释怀，被告被宣告无罪，原告也如释重负，和朋友们相互握手，无罪判定对原告和被告都是一场胜利，原告从极端仇视巴黎斯坦难民甚至被打断两根肋骨，到帮助被告修理汽车，感动女儿降生，看到新生命的成长，也是一次深刻的自我救赎；无罪判定其实说明的是人的无罪，在战争中，人民永远是最无辜，受伤害最深的一方。

For people on both sides of the plaintiff and the defendant is a pair of father and daughter, grew up in different social background, for shame, nationalities, war and human nature have different feelings and understanding, I think this is the place where film design is very clever, finally the defendants acquitted, to the plaintiff and the defendant is a grief, for the father and the daughter as the defenders is also a kind of grief? The greatest part of human nature is understanding and tolerance.
为原告和被告辩护的双方是一对父女，生长在不同社会背景下，对羞辱，民族，战争和人性有不同的感受和理解，我觉得这是影片设计非常巧妙的地方，最后被告宣判无罪，对原告和被告都是一场释怀，对作为辩护人的父女何尝不也是一种释怀呢？人性的最伟大之处在于理解和包容。

Rather than exploring humiliation and nationalism, the film condemns war and any inhumane ACTS of thugs. War-torn people are always the most hurt, but humanity is great.
与其说影片是在探究羞辱和民族主义，不如说是在谴责战争，谴责任何非人道的暴徒行径，饱受战争摧残的人民永远是最受伤害的一方，而人性却是伟大的。

This is an excellent movie about war, culture and humanity, which is highly recommended.
这是一部非常棒的讲战争，讲文化，讲人性的电影，强烈推荐。
