![ntopaz-image-0](https://artisteem.io/media/00f9afaa-bb78-40bf-98b6-7f6c271d0263)This photo was taken while I was touring haihe river in tianjin on a boat in the winter of 2013.


Haihe is famous not only for its distinctive Bridges, but also for its historical buildings on both sides.


These buildings are not only antique European architecture, but also Chinese architecture with a very modern sense. Especially at night, under the background and foil of neon lights, these buildings seem to be endowed with new life, as if telling the unforgettable history.

I used my cellphone HUAWEI NCE-AL00 for this photo.
