![ntopaz-image-0](https://artisteem.io/media/739a7b8b-f466-45f9-8788-c683b867a74d)Autumn in Beijing is the best season of the year. The colors of the plants are very layered, ranging from dark green to light green to yellow leavesï¼Œfull of vitality.

The fountain in the middle of the pond is also at work, shining brightly in the sun and showing a brilliant rainbow, Can you see that?

The length of autumn is relatively short, so we should cherish this moment, enjoy the peace and warmth.

I used a Canon 700D for this photo.
