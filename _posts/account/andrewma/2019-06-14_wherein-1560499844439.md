In 1962, Racial discrimination peaked in the United States. White has inherent superiority, but as a result of the economic situation deteriorated, and a variety of social factors interact with each other, the white men was out of work, At that time, there was one black man who was the famous pianist, And often was invited to the piano performance for high society, there is a hint in film, the black pianist and President Kennedy also have friendship, through the selection of the interview, the black pianist eventually hired unemployed men for two months as his driver in his south tour piano performance.
1962年的美国，种族歧视达到顶峰。白人具有天生的优越感，但由于经济形势每况愈下，以及多种社会原因互相作用，白人男主失业了，当时一位著名的黑人钢琴家经常受遨为上流社会表演钢琴，影片暗示这位黑人钢琴家与当时的美国总统肯尼迪也有交情，通过面试选拔，黑人钢琴家最终聘用赋闲在家的白人男主两个月，为他开车，并陪伴他南下巡演的故事。

Black pianist were well educated and often invited by the upper class to participate in various performances. He was very popular and respected in the society at that time. However, these appearances were superficial. The reason why he was invited to perform was to show that they (the white audience) had culture and status. However, when the pianist left the stage, he was forbidden to share the restaurant and bathroom with the white audience, and still suffered from discrimination. This is the exact words of the pianist in the film. I think that is the most excellent portion of this film.
黑人钢琴家受过良好的教育，经常被上流社会邀请参加各种演出，在当时社会中非常受欢迎和尊重，但这些都是表面现象，实际情况又是如何呢？之所以邀请他演出其实是为了展示自己（白人听众）有文化有地位，而当钢琴家离开舞台后，却被禁止与白人共用餐厅和卫生间，仍然饱受歧视，这是影片中钢琴家的原话，我觉得这是其中最精彩的一个桥段。

On the last stop of the pianist's tour, also because of severe discrimination, the pianist finally put up with it no more, bravely refused to perform for the white people, but played and sang with the black people in the vulgar bar with the hired white driver (white male protagonist).
钢琴家巡演的最后一站，同样由于严重受到歧视，钢琴家终于不再忍受，勇敢的拒绝了为白人演出，而和雇佣的白人司机（男主）在低级酒吧和黑人们一起尽情弹唱。

White male from the beginning of all kinds of discrimination against black pianists, gradually changed to understanding and respect, and made every effort to protect the safety of pianists on the south tour. The change of feeling was profound and natural, without any sense of disharmony. It was a profound friendship that transcended class and race.
白人男主从开始对黑人钢琴家的种种歧视，逐渐转变为理解和尊重，并尽心尽力地在南下巡演途中全力保护钢琴家的安全。这种感情的转变既深刻又自然，毫无违和感，这是一段超越阶级超越种族的深厚友谊。

《Green book》 is a deeply cultural film, but also very inspirational, the film won the Oscar , golden globe and many other awards.
《绿皮书》是一部描写文化很深刻的电影，也非常励志，该影片获得奥斯卡最佳影片，金球奖等多项大奖。
