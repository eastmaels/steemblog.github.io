I heared that the steemit is the first usable blockchain application in the world. That's so cool.

I joined steemit in Feb.2018. In here, I could post and share all kinds of stories what I saw and heared. And I recognized so many friends all of the world. That's indeed amazing.

The blockchain is the best tool not only to protect the copyright, but ensure the fair benefit of author.

However, I also known that just only more than one million accounts in steemit, and there are many duplicates as well. That's seemed not suitable.     

Therefore, I believe that only better and much more applications occurs, just like SCT, and more and more peoples know about steem and easily begin to use that, the steem could be accepted really. Let's do our best to achieve that as soon as possible.

Thanks steemit! Thanks SCT!
