This is a historical theme of the film, the general history of the film will make people feel heavy.
这是一部历史题材的电影，一般讲历史的电影都会让人心情比较沉重。

The story takes place about 400 years ago. Due to the good relationship between the kingdom of Korea and the ancient Ming dynasty of China, the situation has changed since the rise of the great khan. When emperor hong taiji's troops approached the city, the kingdom of Korea is to advance or retreat, how to choose?
故事大约发生在400年前，由于朝鲜王国和中国古代明朝关系很好，但从大汗崛起情况就发生了改变，特别到皇太极时期，被朝鲜王国称之为“蛮夷”的大汗已经建立了清王朝。当皇太极兵临城下时，朝鲜王国是进是退，该如何抉择呢？

In the face of live and death, is dignity important or life important?
在生死面前，是尊严重要，还是生命重要？
Is it more important to die fair and square than mountain, or can beg for life humbly than a feather?
是应该正大光明的去死而重于泰山，还是可以屈辱的乞求活命而轻于鸿毛？
The stronger can treat the weak at will. Can the weak do anything to survive?
强者可以随意对待弱者，弱者可以为了活下来而去做任何事情吗？
As the title of the chapter in the film says, is it live for death or death for live?
就如同影片的章节题目所说，是生而死，还是死而生？

Finally, the king of Korea bowed his head to the emperor taiji. So that the king would not die, and the people of Korea would suffer fewer casualties.
最后，朝鲜国王放下九五之尊，向皇太极行三拜九叩之礼，俯首称臣。因此国王免遭一死，而朝鲜国的百姓也可以少一些伤亡。

This film respects the history and depicts the characters deeply. It not only truly reflects the king's instinctive appeal for survival, but also shows that in the moment of national survival, although the views of the major peace factions and the major war factions are different, their love and loyalty to the country are the same. 
这部影片比较尊重历史，对人物刻画也很深刻，不仅真实体现了朝鲜国王渴望活命的本能诉求，也表现了在国家生死存亡关头，主和派和主战派虽然观点不同，但对国家的热爱和忠诚是一致的。

This is a film about life and death, After watching, I can not help but thoughts myriad, aftertaste endless, it is a wonderful film.
这更是一部描写生与死的影片。看完之后，不由地让人思绪万千，回味无穷，算得上是一部精彩电影！
