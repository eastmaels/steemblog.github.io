![ntopaz-image-0](https://artisteem.io/media/cddab3cf-cefc-4940-939f-b552c1821d0d)This is wuzhizhou island from Sanya, Hainan province of China.

The beach here is the whitest I have ever seen，On one side are rocks, on the other are tropical greens，The rocks were rounded and smoothed by the spray，The green plants are thick and continuous.

There were rows of tiny feet on the beach，Have you noticed that？

I used my cellphone HUAWEI NCE-AL00 for this photo.
