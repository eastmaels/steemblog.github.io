I heard an explosive news about NBA over the weekend,My first feeling is amazing about  that. Because they were MVPS in 17 year and 18 year respectively,And they were all on the  same team as brothers.

However,Excitement followed by great worry,In fact, both of them are very distinctive and  need to hold the ball for a long time,And they all have very strong personalities,Who's  the first player in this  team?

In the end,Let's enjoy the good game,Bless the Rockets! After all, There is a saying that the NBA is  a business.
