Spice House is purely a surprise for our trip. This Russian restaurant is located near Kata Beach, Phuket. Coincidentally, as can be seen from the photo below, we went back and forth to our hotel, passing by it each time. Its surroundings  quite differ from those in Patong Beach. Quiteness and peace can be considered its label.
>Spice House纯粹是我们此次旅行的意外收获。这家俄式餐厅坐落于卡塔海滩的附近，凑巧的是，它正位于我们当时入住的酒店的必经之处，周围的环境与芭东海滩有天壤之别，这里安静、平和。

In addition to No. 6 Restaurant I've introduced before, Spice House ranks second in my list for restaurants in Phuket. Here are two main reasons—one is the quite environment and the other is its good taste. It is said that this restaurant is the combination of Russian and Thai food, but I really don't know what kind I ordered.
>除了六号餐厅，Spice House是我推荐餐厅列表的第二名。两大原因，一是环境，二是味道。据说这家餐厅的味道是俄罗斯菜和泰国菜的结合，不过我实在不知道我所点的是什么风味。

**Let's take a look at what we've ordered 一起来看看我们点了什么**

**<li>Nasi goreng 印尼炒饭</li>**

@mrpointp ordered this dish, for there are three skewers. Actually, this one did not let him down, completely to his taste. The rice matched with a kind of crunchy cake, something like crips, unique and delicious.
> @mrpointp点的印尼炒饭，不为别的，就因为图片上有三串烤肉。这份饭还真没让他失望，烤肉的味道算是比较符合我们的口味，这份炒饭搭配了一种脆脆的饼，别致又美味。

**<li>Khao pad shrimp 鲜虾炒饭</li>**

Of course, this is my dish,whose taste is slightly inferior to nasi goreng(fried rice). It is not completely Thai style. Instead, it's something similar to fried rice with egg, but only a few shrimps are added inside. Originally, the shape of this rice dish were square, but when it was served, the rice had collapsed.
>这份当然是我点的了，虽然味道略逊于印尼炒饭，但并不是完完全全的泰国风味，有点类似我国的蛋炒饭，只是里面加了几只虾。本来炒饭是方方正正的，但端上来的时候饭已经坍塌了>_<。

**<li>President's beef 精选牛排</li>**

This is a dish that looks and tastes delicious. Three pieces of salty and soft beef makes us delight, because we have eaten so much seafood these days. At this time, beef is more flavorful.
>这是一道看起来就非常美味的菜，吃起来也是如此。牛肉是椒盐味，嫩嫩的，三块结结实实的牛肉让我们感到开心，因为这些天吃了太多的海鲜，突然还是觉得牛肉更有味道。

**<li>Honey cake 蜂蜜甜点</li>**

A dessert dish is necessary for me after dining. Having finished some salty food, a dessert dish can make the whole mouth comfortable. Unlike other ordinary desserts, this cake is honey-flavored and tastes different from regular egg cakes.
>甜点也点得恰如其分，吃多了盐味重的食物后，吃点甜食会让整个口腔都感觉很舒适。与普通的甜点不同，这份蛋糕是蜂蜜味的，其口感也与一般的鸡蛋蛋糕不同。

**<li>Soda 苏打水</li>**

Interestingly, there is no real pure soda in our local market. The soda in the supermarket is more or less added with sugar, so it is always sweet to drink. This cup of soda water is a little bitter.
>有趣的是，平时没有喝过真正纯粹的苏打水，超市里的苏打水多多少少都添加了糖分等成分，所以喝起来总是甘甜的。。

If you want to visit this restaurant in the future, there is no need to go to Kata Beach specifically. There is also a Spice House branch near Jungceylon. If you can't get used to Thai food and want to experience something different, this restaurant may be the right choice.
>如果以后朋友们想去这家店尝一尝，也不是非要去卡塔沙滩那边，江西冷附近也有一家Spice House餐厅。假如你完全吃不惯泰国食物，又想体验不一样的美食，去这家餐厅就是正确的选择。

Now when I recall the environment around Spice House, I still feel wonderful. It is in a lane, surrounded by hotels. It's only 400 meters away from the hotel where we live.  It sounds as if there were a delicious restaurant downstairs in my home.I could taste the delicious dishes at any time, feeling so comfortable.
>现在回忆起Spice House周围的环境仍是觉得美妙，它就在一条巷内，周围都是酒店。吃了饭不到两分钟的路程就到达酒店。这种感觉就好像我家小区楼下开了一家味道很棒的餐馆，随时都可以去尝一尝美味，安逸。
