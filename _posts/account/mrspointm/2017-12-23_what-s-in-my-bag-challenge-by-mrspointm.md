#### Hi, steemit friends!💙

![IMG_6472.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbZYBPATCdeTACGKzwnxNZgbjfBAZ32e4no4Ne45mpWEj/IMG_6472.JPG)

First, I want to thank @wanderwithtwo for nominating me for the "What's in my bag" challenge! From her, I've noticed this challenge held by @ramengirl. Now follow me and have a look at my bag to see what's in it.👇🏻

>首先，我想要感谢 @wanderwithtwo点名我参加这个活动叫"我的包包里面有什么"!从她的帖子，我才注意到了 @ramengirl举办的这个活动。那么现在就跟着我一起来看看我的包包里面有什么吧。

This photo is taken in my car, for I am out today. From the size of my bag, you may know there are only a  few things in it. Above are all the things that I take every day. I have classified them into several parts.
>这张照片是在车里拍的，今天我在外面逛吃逛吃。从我包包的尺寸，你们就知道我里面的东西不是很多。以上就是我每天要带的必需品，接下来我将为大家分类介绍。

To be honest, I seldom make up on weekdays. But when dating on weekends, I will carry them. They are Sulwhasoo perfecting cushion, a Kate  eyebrow pencil and a Mac lipstick. In addition, there is a contact lens case.
>说实话，我平时上班都是素颜的，但周末出去玩的时候，我就会带上这些东西。他们是雪花秀的气垫bb霜，Kate的眉笔（个人很少画，但这个眉笔真的很好用）和Mac的口红一支。另外，我会带着隐形眼镜盒。

This card bag contains all the cards needed in my daily life. I hardly carry cash but this bag is a necessity for me. 
>这个卡包涵盖了我所有日常生活中需要的卡，我还很少会带现金出门，但这个卡包我一定会带。

Last but equally important,  these four items are much more important than the others referred to.  The keys to my house and my office, the key to my car, a USB flash disk and a cellphone are what I use every day. 
>最后，这四样物品都是我每天必带的，家里以及办公室钥匙，车钥匙，上课用的U盘和手机。当然，手机是最主要的，几乎日常的开销都用手机支付。

That's all the stuff in my bag. @wanderwithtwo said that her bag is close to being one of the most unfemanine bags. I think mine is closer to that.
>这就是我包里的所有东西，  @wanderwithtwo说她的包是没有女人味的包包，我想说我的才是。O(∩_∩)O

****
Now, it's time for nomination. I would like to see if @susanlo and @sweetieprincess can share what they have in their bags for this challenge. 😊
>下一个我想提名 @susanlo 和 @sweetieprincess来参加这个活动。希望两位美女不介意给我们看她们包包里的东西。😊
