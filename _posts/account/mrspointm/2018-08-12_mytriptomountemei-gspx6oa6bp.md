<strong>Hi, steemit friends!💙</strong>

The temperature in summer in Sichuan is not as hot as it is in other places, but its humidity may make you fully experience a “sticky” feeling, which is like a natural sauna. With the holidays going on, @mrpointp and I took a spontaneous trip to Mount Emei.

四川夏天的温度和国内其他地方相比还算不上热到令人发指，但这里城市的湿度能让你完美体验到一种“黏糊糊”的感觉，那是天然的桑拿房。趁着假期还没结束，和 @mrpointp来了趟说走就走的周边游，峨眉山。

Mount Emei is famous not only because it is the natural and cultural relics of the world but also because of the Buddhism culture. It's one of the Four Buddhist Holy Mountains. Wanfo Summit is the highest, around 3099 meters (euqal to 10167 feet) above sea level.

峨眉山不仅仅是世界文化与自然双遗产还因其佛教文化而扬名，它是中国“四大佛教名山”之一。山上的万佛顶最高，海拔3099米。

Mount Emei, located in Leshan, Sichuan Province, is a famous tourist attraction at home and abroad, which is __<em>an ideal place for mountain climbers</em>__, but many people do not know that Mount Emei is  __<em>a perfect summer resort</em>__.  When the weather is hot, our locals are likely to choose a good farmhouse in Mount Emei and stay for a few days , and even some live there for one month. Next, I will take you to appreciate the beautiful scenery of Mount Emei.

峨眉山，坐落在四川省乐山市境内，是扬名中外的旅游胜地，这里是__爬山爱好者理想的地方__，但许多人不知道，峨眉山更是__夏季避暑的度假胜地__。尤其是本地的老百姓，天气炎热的时候会在峨眉山找一家不错的农家乐度几天假，有些人更是一住一个月。接下来，我将带一起游览峨眉山。

Most people like to drive up the mountain, but this is absolutely not the way I recommend. Instead, I suggest you take the sightseeing car. For one thing, there are countless bends on the road. For another, all tourists' private cars must be placed in a parking lot halfway to the summit. If you want to go to the Golden Summit( the top of the mountain), you have to take a bus.

很多人喜欢自驾上山，但这不是我推荐的方式，我比较建议坐观光车上山。一是上山路弯道无数，二是自家的车也只能在途中的某个停车场停放，想要去金顶还是要坐大巴车。

We bought tickets at Huangwan Station and parked our car there, including entrance ticket and round-trip ticket. The price of entrance ticket for adults is  __<em>185 yuan (equal to $27)</em>__ and the latter one costs __<em>90 yuan (equal to $13</em>__). Some tourists choose to spend two days walking up the mountain completely. No matter which way you choose, you need to buy tickets. In addition, do prepare all the necessities.

我们是在黄湾站买票搭乘旅游大巴，其中包含门票和往返车票。__成人门票是185元__（除市民，仅10元），__往返车票是90元__。还有部分游客选择完全步行上山，不论用什么方式上山都是需要买门票的，另外，准备好一切必需品。

Here is a panoramic map of Mount Emei. As you can see from the photo, there are so many sights that are worth visiting, such as Wannian Temple, Leidongping etc.

在此给大家分享一张峨眉山的全景游览图，图中有很多景点都值得一去，比如万年寺，雷洞坪。

<img class="alignnone wp-image-180 size-full" src="http://mrspointm.vornix.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_7056.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" /><br/>

The two-hour drive is tiring, but when you get off at Leidongping, you will feel the coolness as it is in autumn. It is recommended to bring at least one overcoat or jacket, because of the large temperature difference between the foot and the top of the mountain.

两个小时的车程还是让人挺疲倦的，但在雷洞坪下车后感受到秋天般的凉爽就感觉一切都值得了。建议大家至少带一件外套，因为山上和山下的温度相差巨大。

<img class="alignnone wp-image-182 size-full" src="http://mrspointm.vornix.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_7203.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" /><br/>

If your destination is the Golden Summit, you will have two choices. One is to climb the mountain, and the other is to take the cable car, about two or three minutes, but it takes at least an hour to climb. There are monkeys in the mountain, and they like to interact with people, but it is said that monkeys there will grab things from tourists, so take care of your belongings.

如果你的目的地是金顶，那么你有两种选择。要么从雷洞坪爬到山顶，要么买票坐缆车吧，大概两三分钟，但爬山至少要一个小时左右。山上有猴，还会与人互动，但据说猴子会抢游客手上的东西，所以务必要保管好随身物品。

Let's stop here. Next chapter I will share the beautiful sights on the Golden Summit. Hope you can enjoy it.

好啦！就暂且搁笔啦，过几天我将为大家具体介绍金顶的美景，敬请期待吧！
