Wangfujing shopping mall in Leshan was opened up around two or three years ago, and the cafe named Chun Coffee has come into being there since then. Leshan, a tourist city, is lacking in such a large dessert store. Since it opened, I thought I could occasionally come for some drinks but in fact I have visited it twice in three years.

Compared with the design style of Starbucks, its style makes me more comfortable, and there are much more furnishings and decorations. Now, I will introduce to you this cafe and its delicious food.

At the entrance of the shop stands a four-meter-high tree, on which many bird models can be seen.

Here is an European-style vintage bookshelf, plant-filled stairs, birds in the golden iron cage, and bare branches.

This is the brief information for a certain kind of coffee, but what attracts me most is its creative decorations.

Lemon and cucumber soda is free of charge, which can be  taken from this table, so there is no need for you to order drinks.

There are teddy bears of different colours on each table, for each one stands for a number.  The waiter will serve the dish according to the bear (number) you get. Isn't it special?

Multilayer Cake with Mango

With a great flavor, this one looks very delicate. On the upper layer are a blueberry, a piece of mango, fresh ice-cream and a peppermint leaf.  But the mango is not fresh, looking like canned mango.

Honey Bread

Anyone who favors bread can have a try. The bread itself is sweet, and with some honey and jam added, it is much more delicious.

Milk tea with marshmallow

The taste of milk tea is brilliant, which differs from the milk tea sold in the common tea stores. The tea flavor is more than its sweetness.

I like drinks and desserts there, but I prefer its atmosphere and surroundings. With wide space, the whole store is full of natural atmosphere. If my introduction really attracts you, you might as well pay a visit to it.



乐山的王府井是在两三年前开的业，淳咖啡也随之开业了。乐山这座旅游城市正是缺少这类大型的甜品店。当时我就想着，偶尔可以来淳咖啡喝点东西，但实际上三年间也就光顾过两次。

相对星巴克充满设计感的装修风格，淳咖啡的风格更有舒适感，摆设和装饰也更加饱满。接下来我将为大家介绍一下淳咖啡的店貌和美味的食物们。

进门便是一棵四米高的树，满树都是鸟模型。

欧式复古书架、植物萦绕的楼梯、金色铁笼中的鸟儿、光秃秃的树枝。

某款咖啡的介绍，我觉得这种摆设很有创意。

柠檬黄瓜水自取台，所以来这里点不点饮品都可以。

每个桌上都有不同颜色的小熊，每一只小熊相当于一个取餐牌，有没有很别致？

芒果千层蛋糕

这份蛋糕口感不错，看起来也是十分精致的。最上层是一颗蓝莓，薄荷叶，鲜奶油和芒果丁，但唯一不足就是芒果不是使用新鲜芒果，貌似是芒果罐头。

蜂蜜面包

蜂蜜面包，喜欢吃面包的朋友去淳咖啡就一定要尝尝这款面包。面包本身带甜味，再蘸适量的蜂蜜和果酱，就更加美味了。

棉花糖奶茶

奶茶的味道很棒，和一般奶茶店出售的奶茶区别很大，茶味胜于甜味。

我喜欢淳咖啡的饮品和甜点，但我更喜欢这里的氛围，空间开阔，整个店面充满了自然的气息。如果我的介绍吸引了你，不妨去淳咖啡品尝一番。
