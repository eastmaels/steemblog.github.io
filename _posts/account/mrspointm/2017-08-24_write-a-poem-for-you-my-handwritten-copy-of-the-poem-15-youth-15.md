Be sure that you have never had any regrets in your life which only lasts for a few decades. Laugh or cry as you like, and it's meaningless to oppress yourself.
<blockquote>人生短短几十年，不要给自己留下了什么遗憾，想笑就笑，想哭就哭，该爱的时候就去爱，无谓压抑自己。</blockquote>

#### Dear steemit friends,

I want to share with you a poem <i> Youth  </i>, written by Xi Murong. The original text is as follows:
今天想要和大家分享的一首诗，叫《青春》，作者席慕蓉。原文如下：

<b>青春</b>
所有的结局都已写好

所有的泪水也都已启程

却忽然忘了是怎么样的一个开始

在那个古老的不再回来的夏日

无论我如何地去追索

年轻的你只如云影掠过

而你微笑的面容极浅极淡

逐渐隐没在日落后的群岚

遂翻开那发黄的扉页

命运将它装订的极为拙劣

含着泪 我一读再读

却不得不承认

青春 是一本太仓促的书

****
<code><strong>Translation version 译文</strong></code>

<b>Youth</b>
Each of the endings had been written

All the tears been already on the way

But how did it begin we’d forgotten

On that old unrepeatable summer’s day

No matter how I used to follow trace

Thee young, in the flashy floating clouds lost

A softest and faintest smile on thou face

Which day by day disappeared amidst

From hill to hill after the sun’s falling

Then the yellowish title page unfolded

Fortune made it with awfully binding

With tears again and again had I read

Being unwilling to admit the truth

All is rush written in the book of youth

****
The following is my handwritten copy of this poem.
以下是我的手抄本。

Maybe all of us miss the stage of youth most. When young,  we always consider our future as fresh and desirable, which I think is the freest time. The poet expresses her idea about youth through this poem. In her eyes, she believes whether happy or worried, time will always pass. But she has reluctantly accepted the fact and expressed her own  infinite attachment to youth.

<blockquote>每个人最怀念的阶段或许都是青春吧，青春时的我们看待未来总是新鲜的、向往的，那是一段最自由自在的时间。诗人通过此诗怀念自己的青春，她认为青春无论是喜是忧，都已成往事，但却让人依依不舍，表达了自己对青春的无限依恋之情。</blockquote>
