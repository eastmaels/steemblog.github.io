Theme: Daily Food

Location: Chengdu, China

Camera used: OPPO R11

This picture was taken in a Japanese restaurant. That day, @mrpointp and I happened to pass this restaurant. At that time, I was attracted by its delicate decoration and went into it. It has proved that I am very satisfied with its delicious food of high quality. I like salmon sushi best.
>这张照片是在一家日料店拍的。那天和 @mrpointp逛街时经过这家店，于是果断选择了这家餐厅。的确没有让人失望，味道满意，性价比也高，最爱这道三文鱼寿司。
