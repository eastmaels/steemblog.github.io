#### Hi, steemit friends!💙

One afternoon, I , as well as @mrpointp, drove home after class to enjoy the delicious food that I had missed so much.  May be it was crazy for us to drive over 100 kilometers for food and return in a day. It happened that my cousin's newly-opened gym was near this restaurant. As a result, we were invited there. After exercising, it was time for dinner.
>有一段时间没吃过乐山的美食了，于是星期天上午的课结束后便回了乐山，也算是突然来了兴致，有的人管这叫没事找事，我认为这是跟着感觉走，嘿嘿。刚巧我表哥合作投资的健身房最近开业了，他之前就邀请我们去免费体验，于是今天就去运体验了一番。其实之所以想去健身，是因为我们都很喜欢健身后又饿又累然后晚上去享用各种美食的感觉，美味会翻倍。

This restaurant has been existing for years. I still remember when I studied in Leshan I always went here for lunch. Now, it is still popular among people. 
>这家店有年头了，记得当初我还在乐山念书的时候就吃过这家店的美食，至今此店仍然生意兴隆。

The first time he ate steamed pork dumplings (shao mai in Chinese), he fell in love with it.  Every time we come back, he always asks me to go here for dinner. These dumplings taste like steamed buns, and with chili sauce it is perfect.

> @mrpointp自从第一次尝过乐山的烧麦之后，就喜欢上这道美食，每次来乐山都说想尝尝烧麦，他说乐山烧麦的味道有点像小笼包的感觉，配上辣椒蘸水，美味！

In my previous post, I have introduced this dish called benben chicken. This kind of food is one of the traditional snacks in Chengdu and Leshan is also famous for benben chicken. It tastes spicy and a little bit sweet. 
>在之前的文章里也介绍过乐山钵钵鸡，这道菜是传统的成都小吃之一，当然乐山也因钵钵鸡而闻名。味道甜咸适中，以麻辣为主。几乎在乐山的大大小小的餐饮集中地都能见到它的“身影”。

Having worked for a week, it's time for relaxation.  Merry Christmas and happy Sunday! 
>辛苦工作一周，到了休息的时候就应该放松一下，这样的周末很开心！祝大家圣诞快乐，过个快乐的星期天。
