#### Dear steemit friends, 

I want to share with you a poem<i> A Blossoming Tree</i>, written by Xi Murong. The original text is as follows:
今天想要和大家分享的一首诗，叫《一棵开花的树》，作者席慕蓉。原文如下：

<b>一棵开花的树</b>
如何让你遇见我
在我最美丽的时刻
为这
我已在佛前求了五百年
求它让我们结一段尘缘
佛于是把我化作一棵树
长在你必经的路旁
阳光下慎重地开满了花
朵朵都是我前世的盼望
当你走近
请你细听
颤抖的叶是我等待的热情
而你终于无视地走过
在你身后落了一地的
朋友啊 那不是花瓣
是我凋零的心
****
Translation version 译文

<b> A Blossoming Tree</b>
May Buddha let us meet
in my most beautiful hours,
I have prayed for it
for five hundred years.
Buddha made me a tree
by the path you may take,
In full blossoms I'm waiting in the sun
every flower carrying my previous hope.
As you are near, listen carefully
the quivering leaves are my waiting zeal,
As you pass by the tree
without noticing me,
My friend, upon the ground behind you
is not the fallen petals but my withered heart.
****
The following is my handwritten copy of this poem.
以下是我的手抄本。

This poem is  to compare a tree to a girl yearning for love. She have prayed for five hundred years in front of the Buddha. And the Buddha made her a tree. The author express the crazy heart so vividly; the second half of the poem tells falling petals are her withered heart, representing the sadness after missing. This adds a little melancholy to this poem. In fact, when the author wrote this poem,  there is no such sentimentality.  Just because when she took the train, she didn't have time to look at the tree carefully and then wrote this poem.  
<blockquote>这首诗是借树比喻一个怀春的少女，在佛前求了五百年只为一段尘缘以及化作一棵树，把一颗痴心痴情的心表达地淋漓尽致；而诗的后半段写道“落下的花瓣是她凋零的心”，代表着错过后的悲伤，给这首诗又平添几分惆怅。其实作者写这首诗时，并没有儿女情长那般复杂的背景，只是因为乘坐火车时因一棵“没有来得及细看的树”而有感而发。</blockquote>
