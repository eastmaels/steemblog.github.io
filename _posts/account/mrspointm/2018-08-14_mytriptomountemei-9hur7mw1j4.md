<strong>Hi, steemit friends!💙</strong>

The Golden Summit, also known as Huazang Temple, is the last stop for our trip. In this place, you can watch the four natural wonders of Mt. Emei—sunrise, the sea of clouds, the buddha surrounded by lights and Shengdeng. Please come with me to appreciate the beauty of the Golden Summit!

峨眉山金顶也称华藏寺，是峨眉游山的最终目的地，在金顶可以观看峨眉四大奇观——日出、云海、佛光、圣灯。跟我一起去看看金顶的美景吧！

After getting out of the cable car, we climbed the stairs for a few more minutes and finally came to the Golden Summit we were longing to see. It was really sacred and spectacular. Looking up at the golden statue of Ten party Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, I felt a sense of reverence, and there were some tourists worshiping reverently.

下了缆车，再爬几分钟的楼梯，终于来到我们向往的金顶，真的非常神圣和壮观。仰视着十方普贤菩萨的金像，内心的崇敬感油然而生，我们也可以看见一些游客礼拜着神圣的金像。

Compared with Leidongping, the temperature in the Golden Summit is much lower as if it were early winter.  Thus, if you want to visit here, __<em>do prepare thick clothes or rent a down jacket</em>__ there. Standing at the top of Mt. Emei, I felt the world was getting smaller. No wonder that ancient poets standing in high places couldn't help reading or creating poems.

金顶和雷洞坪的温差也非常明显，那种差距好比初冬和秋天，所以要去峨眉山金顶的话__尽量准备厚衣服或在山上租一件羽绒服__。站在峨眉山的顶端，才让我真正体会到什么是一览众山小，怪不得古代诗人站在高处总喜欢吟诗作对，实属情不自禁！

It is worth mentioning that you can also overlook Mt. Gongga. Of course, watching the sunrise is a good choice, but you have to get up at around 4:30 a.m. It's a pity that I have been there twice but I never saw the sunrise, for I got up too late. The photos of the sunrise taken by others is gorgeous.

值得一提的是在金顶还能远眺贡嘎山，当然看日出是个不错的选择，但是早上最晚4点半就起床。光看看别人分享的日出图片就很美了，肉眼中的日出一定更震撼，无奈的是我去了两次都没看到日出。

Besides the place above, there is another good one to take photos, which is called the Golden Mouth, where you can watch the unpredictable clouds. Golden Mouth consists of numerous deep cliffs which stick far out. This place looks like a cliff mouth. On sunny days, you may enjoy the distant beautiful views on the top of Mt. Emei.

除了上图这个地方外，金顶有一处观景视线绝佳的位置，名为金刚嘴，可以观看变幻莫测的云海。金刚嘴是由玄武岩组成的柱状节理行程悬崖峭壁，峭削如棱，翘首云空，形同岩嘴。在晴朗乌云的时候，俯瞰百里平川，如铺锦绣。

The locks on the love chains carry people's best wishes, which are about love, friendship and kinship.

两旁的同心锁承载着人们的美好祝愿，关乎爱情，友情，亲情。

In addition to the Golden Statue, there are many Buddhist constructions, like Woyun Temple, which give us visitors a sense of quietness.

除了金像，这里还有许多佛教的建筑，比如卧云禅院，带给游客清幽的感觉。

As there was no cable car service at that time, we had to walk down to Leidongping. __<em>ATTENTION: It is necessary to buy a bamboo pole or a walking stick.</em>__ First, you can avoid being attacked by monkeys. Second, it is more stable when walking. It is recommended that the elderly not walk down the mountain, which may easily damage their knees.

由于缆车收班，我们只能走路下山至雷洞坪。__买一根竹竿非常有必要__，一是可以防止猴子袭击，二是走起路来更稳，建议老年人不要走路上下山，容易损伤膝盖。

Tips: If you do not plan to live in the mountains, it is best to set out in the early morning, for the sightseeing cars and cable cars will stop working at around 5 or 6 pm. Instead, if you want to watch the sunrise next day, you need book a room in Golden Summit ahead of time.

小提示：如果不打算在山上住的朋友最好在上午进山，因为旅游大巴和缆车下午五六点就收班了。如果你想在山上住一宿并且想看第二天的日出，那就预订金顶的酒店。

In this hot August, it's appropriate to visit Mt. Emei for a vacation. Take your family or friends here to experience the high mountains, the unpredictable clouds and the magical charm of nature.

时值八月，正是炎热的季节，现在来峨眉山度假正好，带着家人或朋友来此地感受山的巍峨峻拔，云的变幻莫测以及大自然的神奇魅力吧。
