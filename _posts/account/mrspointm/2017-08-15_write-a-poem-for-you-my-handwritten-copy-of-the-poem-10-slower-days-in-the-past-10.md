#### Dear steemit friends,

I want to share with you a poem <i>Slower Days in the Past</i>, written by Mu Xin. The original text is as follows:
今天想要和大家分享的一首诗，叫《从前慢》，作者木心。原文如下：

<b>从前慢</b>
记得早先少年时
大家诚诚恳恳
说一句 是一句

清早上火车站
长街黑暗无行人
卖豆浆的小店冒着热气

从前的日色变得慢
车，马，邮件都慢
一生只够爱一个人

从前的锁也好看
钥匙精美有样子
你锁了 人家就懂了


****
<code><strong>Translation version 译文</strong></code>

<b>Slower Days in the Past</b>
Remember young days in the past
People were sincere and honest
They honored what they said

Early morning in the railway station
Long, dark and empty was the street
The soybean milk diner was steaming with heat

Days were slower in the past
Carriage, horse and mail did not reach fast
You need your lifetime to just love the person who is right

The lock was fine in the past
The key was exquisite and fit
You lock and he will get it
****
The following is  my handwritten copy of this poem.
以下是我的手抄本。

This poem has used many images, such as carriage, horse and mail etc.,  the author expresses his feelings with such simple language, which also sums up our feelings. People living in this fast-paced society are longing for the slow life in the past. This so-called <i>slower</i> conveys simpleness and romance in our life. Later, this poem has also been adapted into a song, with the same name <i>Slower Days in the Past</i>. By this means,  literature can be used to interpret songs.
<blockquote>这首诗用了许多意象，如车、马、邮件等，简简单单的语言将感受表达出来，也是我们大多数的感受。生活在快节奏社会的人们，对过去慢生活的向往。这种慢里面传达出了朴素、浪漫、简单的生活情怀。这首诗还被改编成了歌曲，同名《从前慢》，让文学可以用歌曲的方式来演绎。</blockquote>
