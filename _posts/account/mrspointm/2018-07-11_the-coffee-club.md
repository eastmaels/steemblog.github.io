To some degree, I don't like coffee but have preference for desserts. In addidion to food guide,  wherever I go,  it is essential for me to find two or three different kinds of dessert shops, one of which is the Coffee Club. Although its flagship is coffee, I am more interested in the desserts here.
>我不钟意咖啡，但我却对甜品情有独钟。每到一个地方除了做美食攻略，寻觅两三家甜品店也是必不可少的。The coffee club就是其中之一，虽然他们的主打是咖啡，但我却对他们的甜品感兴趣。

It's extremely hot and humid in Phuket these days. Except shopping malls, most small restaurants have no air-conditioner. The Coffee Club is also a good place to relax and aviod the summer heat. Drinking coffee, eating desserts, @mrpointp and I enjoyed air conditioning and observed foreign customers that afternoon.  They spoke different languages ​​and behaved differently. Suddenly, I found that this small Phuket has brought almost half of the world together. It's wonderful. In such a rushed trip, we might as well spend a little time observing a city. I promise its beauty of different kind will be appreciated. It is the beauty that can not be shown by the fabulous advertisement.
>普吉岛极其湿热，除了商场，大部分小餐厅没有冷气，这家咖啡俱乐部就是避暑的好去处。喝着咖啡吃着甜品享受空调，观察着来来往往的外国人，他们语言各异，举止各异，忽然发现小小的普吉岛竟然汇集了几乎大半个世界，这是一种很奇妙的感觉。匆匆忙忙的旅程中，就应该花一点时间安静下来，悄悄地观察一个城市，你一定会发现它不一样的美，那是再精彩的广告也无法展现的美。

**<li>Chocolate topped with brownie chunks 巧克力沙冰</li>**

The first time I saw this dessert, it made me think of  a little woman dressed in a costume, but its color was a bit deeper. It tastes really good. I haven't known that chocolate and water ice can be combined perfectly. The latter can control the sweetness of the former well.
>看到这份甜品，我的第一印象就是它像一个盛装出席的小妇人，只是颜色深沉了些。它的味道真的很棒，第一次觉得巧克力与沙冰是那么完美的组合，后者可以很好地控制住前者的甜腻味。

**<li>Cinnamon bun with almond praline 肉桂杏仁面包</li>**

The main taste of this dessert is naturally cinnamon and almond, but the best part is the upper layer—the thick white part. I can't describe what it tastes at all, but it's really delicious. The inside bread is soft.
>这道甜品的主要味道自然是肉桂杏仁味，不过最好吃的部分就是它表面那一层，有些厚有些白的部分。形容不出来到底是什么味道，但真的很好吃，面包里面的部分很松软。

**<li>French fries 炸薯条</li>**

 Several green plants are lying on the French fries, which is really refreshing and  greatly increases our appetite. Personally, all kinds of French fries are similar, and  the difference lies in the degree of ripeness and salt. The one is toally to my taste. The ketchup offered differs from that in China, whose sauce is obviously salty and sour.
>几根绿色的植物躺在薯条上，让人看了耳目一新，食欲大增。个人觉得，全世界的炸薯条都是差不多的，区别在于生熟程度和咸味，而这份炸薯条很对我的胃口，番茄酱和国内的不一样，这份酱能明显地尝出咸酸味。

A café should make desserts so delicious, lol..! It is located near the exit of the Jungceylon Shopping Center. If you are tired of shopping, this is a good choice. In addition, I hear that the  Coffee Club also offer food in addition to desserts, If I  get another chance, I 'm sure to have a try.
>一家咖啡馆把甜品做得那么好吃，是不是有点不务正业了，哈哈。这家俱乐部就位于江西冷购物中心的出口旁，如果你疲于逛街，这里倒是个不错的选择。另外，听说除了甜点还有更多的饮食服务，下次有机会一定要去尝尝。
