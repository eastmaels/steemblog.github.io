#### Hi, steemit friends!💙
During the days on steemit,  I've written many articles about different places I travelled to. But I seldom introduce my hometown completely, just part of it.  Thank @anomadsoul for holding <a href="https://steemit.com/my2018/@anomadsoul/contest-my-2018-a-tour-around-my-town-100-sbd-in-prizes">such a meaningful contest</a> and now I take this opportunity to introduce my hometown in detail. Here is my beautiful hometown, Leshan. Located in the southwest of Sichuan, it is a city known for its tourism and delicious food. Let's take a look at its natural landscape first.
>在steemit上的这段时间，我介绍了很多旅游过的地方却没有完整地介绍过自己的家乡。非常感谢 @anomadsoul举办这个<a href="https://steemit.com/my2018/@anomadsoul/contest-my-2018-a-tour-around-my-town-100-sbd-in-prizes">非常有意义的比赛</a>，我借此机会好好地介绍一番。我的美丽的家乡，四川乐山市，一个汇集旅游与美食的城市，首先带大家瞧一瞧乐山的山山水水。

#### <center>Tourist attractions</center>

<b>Mount Emei</b>
<div class="pull-right">https://steemitimages.com/DQmZeuUeccXKfMi3roUWoKDChzqJ81XFDQqpLsZWkRaznzm/IMG_0510.JPG</div>Maybe you haven’t heard of this city but you may know this world-famous tourist destination Mount Emei. In my heart, this place has always been a magical one. Every year, many tourists come here to experience the beauty of nature, especially in summer vocation. A great number of people will flood and choose a farmhouse in Mount Emei to live in and stay here for a month in order to avoid the hottest weather. As you can see from the picture below, Baoguo Temple, the first temple of Mountain Emei, is located at the foot. This temple is surrounded by phoebes, red walls and filled with the scent of incense. When there are fewer tourists, I like going there to relax and enjoy the leisure time.

>乐山最闻名的旅游胜地莫过于峨眉山，在我心中这一直都是一个神奇的地方。每年都会有许多游客到此感受大自然的美，尤其是夏天峨眉山更是会迎来大量的避暑游客，很多人会在峨眉山上选一家农家乐一住就是一个月，为的就是避开最热的天气。报国寺位于峨眉山下，是峨眉山的第一座寺庙，寺院周围楠树蔽空，红墙围绕，香烟袅袅，喜欢在游客较少的时候到报国寺散心，更加能感受到平静。峨眉山上有一座金顶，它是峨眉游山的终点，也是最辉煌闪耀的一处，并且峨眉山金顶的日出是非常震撼人心的画面。

<b>Leshan Giant Buddha</b>

Coincidentally, another famous attraction in Leshan is also related to the "Buddha", that is, Leshan Giant Buddha. Leshan Giant Buddha, also known as Lingyun Buddha, is located in confluence of the Minjiang River, Tsing Yi River and Dadu River. The buddha is across the river. Standing in front of the buddha, you will become very tiny. For people in here, Leshan Giant Buddha is not only a tourist attraction, but also our eudemon.

>巧的是，乐山的另一处著名景点也是与“佛”有关，那就是闻名遐迩的乐山大佛。乐山大佛，又名凌云大佛，位于岷江、青衣江和大渡河三江汇流处，与乐山城区隔江相望。在大佛面前， 人会变得十分渺小，对我们乐山人来说，乐山大佛不仅仅是旅游景点，更是乐山的守护神。

#### <center>Local food</center>
<b>Qiaojiao beef</b>
<div class="pull-right">https://steemitimages.com/DQmTZ9svvG1P9CnJ2oPJcyDYuFsHk9fUoZbDaxD2UQNeTcz/IMG_0505.JPG</div>
It, a famous local snack of Leshan, is made from the internal organ of of a bull. Besides its delicious taste, it can helps to dispel coldness and relieve a cough. It has become national intangible cultural heritage. There is such a story about the origin of this food. It’s said that in the 1930s, a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine called Mr. Luo, was good at decotion. One day, he saw some rich men throw beef offal into the river, which he thought was wasteful. So he collected them and take home to stew with herbs in the stockpot. Surprisingly, the soup tastes delicious. From then on, he began to open a restaurant to sell this kind of snacks. Every day, the restaurant was heavy with people. Owing to few seats, some customers even sat on the threshold and ate the delicious beef, crossing their legs. That is why we call it “Qiaojiao” beef.

>跷脚牛肉，乐山的一道名小吃，是由牛的内脏制成的一道菜肴。除了它味道鲜美吸引人外，它还具有散寒止咳的药膳功效，被评为国家级非物质文化遗产。关于这道美食的起源，有这么一个故事：相传在三十年代初，有位精通中医的罗老中医擅长烹药，一天他看到一些大户人家把牛杂扔到河里，觉得很浪费。于是，他把牛杂捡回洗净后，放在有中草药的汤锅，发现汤汁甚是鲜香。从此他便开店卖起了这种汤，每天堂堂爆满。由于没有足够的座位，有的客人干脆坐在门槛翘着二郎腿端着碗吃。久而久之，跷脚牛肉的名字便诞生了。

<b>Jellied bean curd </b>

![IMG_0506.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmWJJXrScA4Zdtnk5ABegfXJ8KJhfcSuNn9DA1q3PN6iNj/IMG_0506.JPG)

It is one of Chinese traditional snacks. It exists in both the south and the north. Northerners favor salty food, while our southerners like sour and spicy food(as you can see from the pictures above). I have only eaten sour and spicy jellied bean curd, which is made from soya beans. It is rich in nutrition and can be considered as our breakfast.
>豆腐脑属于中国传统小吃，南北方都有，北方喜爱咸食，南方喜爱酸辣。我只吃过南方的豆腐脑（从上图中可以看出这一点）。豆腐脑是一种用黄豆制作的小吃，颇有营养，当作早餐吃也很不错。

<b>Bobo chicken</b>
<div class="pull-right">https://steemitimages.com/DQmXTAPijq7hg3pgQN9veLdVJhw885qeST3kdCWFJk1X8Yu/IMG_0504.JPG</div>
Bobo chicken, which has existed since the Qing dynasty, is one of the traditional snacks in Chengdu and Leshan. In our dialect, "bobo" means crock pots. The outside of the crock is beautifully painted with dragon symbols. To make this snack, some spicy condiments are needed to put in the crock. Then some dishes must be specially processed and held up with the bamboo skewers. After the dishes cool down, people put them into the crock. In summer, we always choose this snack, because it tastes good and doesn't burn the mouth. Of course, the drink is needed.

>钵钵鸡,清代就已经存在,是四川成都和乐山的传统小吃。“钵钵”其实就是瓦罐，钵外面是画着红黄相间的瓷质龙纹。钵内盛放配以麻辣为主的佐料，菜品在特珠殊加工后用签串制，晾冷浸于各种口味的佐料中。在夏天，我们通常会选择品尝钵钵鸡，因为真的是太美味了,而且不烫嘴。 当然饮料也还是必备的。

 If you come to Leshan, you will find almost everyone eating this food with this local drink（as you can see from the picture above） on the table.
>如果来乐山，你会发现几乎每个人吃着这种小吃，桌上放着一瓶峨眉雪（正如上图可见）。

<b>Special pancake</b>

![IMG_0491.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmaDQRPG4CREQhrQfmARj8Bmmenu1VS3CwT5Z3JVsswU6M/IMG_0491.JPG)

![IMG_0492.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZP4kstFgcc49RQZQnBcbFvMcy9YfoNrZxJFYe7czoEaF/IMG_0492.JPG)

![IMG_0494.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmTRgcimFLNQyLaVQ2CeF9f7sjS6L7knQi7vZV8W2F3K8q/IMG_0494.JPG)

Special pancake made of eggs is also a very popular snack. Several days ago I introduced something about it and you can click <a href="https://steemit.com/cn/@mrspointm/4yf1ro">here</a> to know more. There are a couple who have made pancake for years and each time I go back I always rush to buy it. To my surprise, no matter how much cake you order at a time, they always remember it, don’t ask you a second time, and then systematically deliver the steaming cake to you.
>蛋烘糕在乐山也是非常受欢迎的小吃，前两天我才介绍了乐山有一对做了十几年蛋烘糕的夫妻，从小到大我都特别喜欢他们做出来的蛋烘糕。令我觉得奇特的是，不管你一次性点多少个，那个师傅总是会记得住，不会再问你第二遍，然后有条不紊地将热气腾腾的蛋烘糕递到你手上。

There are many other delicacies such as sweet skin duck (really delicious), kǎ bǐng and báo bǐng(similar to rouga) etc. I have not taken pictures of them before, so I won’t describe in detail here. But I will introduce one by one in the future.
>乐山还有不少其他的美食，比如甜皮鸭（真的很美味）、卡饼（类似肉夹馍）、犍为薄饼等，由于我没有自己拍摄的照片，在这里就不详细介绍了，不过以后我会逐一介绍的。

![图片2.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSMKF8TgJ2XD5TLswejv4MAVqqfvYTC22nsXTSjk5dSs4/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%872.png)

#### <center>People and their dialect</center>
When it comes to people in Leshan, comfortable can be used to describe our life. We enjoy our life and slow down our pace. We also like playing mahjong,lol... but to be exact, it is almost the majority of Sichuan city’s label. Some people say that we Sichuan people are very casual, I do agree.
>说到乐山人，在我眼里那就是喜欢吃美食喜欢游山玩水喜欢打麻将，哈哈，但准确地说，这几乎是大部分四川城市的标签。有人说我们四川人很休闲，我倒是同意，爱喝茶打牌的人确实多，但要说我们四川人懒，那我就不答应了，只是我们喜欢放慢节奏享受生活。

People in Leshan also has a major and specific feature, that is, many people in other places think Leshan dialect is the most difficult dialect in Sichuan to understand. For one thing, they speak with such a fast pace. For another, to understand the pronunciation is not easy. What makes people unexpected is that even people in other places of Sichuan do not understand Leshan dialect. In fact, its pronunciation and the Wu dialect are closest, and most of the pronunciation in Shanghai dialect and Leshan dialect pronunciation is exactly the same, I also hear that there are some similarities between Leshan dialect and Cantonese.
>乐山人还有一大特色，那就是乐山话，很多人都认为乐山话是最难以听懂的四川方言，一是语速快，二是发音不易听懂。令许多人都意想不到的是，许多四川人都听不懂的乐山方言，它的入声发音和吴语最接近，大部分入声字在上海话中和乐山话中读音是完全相同的，我也听过乐山话和粤语相似的说法。

Thanks for reading and welcome to my hometown. 💓
>感谢阅读，同时欢迎大家来我的家乡做客。
