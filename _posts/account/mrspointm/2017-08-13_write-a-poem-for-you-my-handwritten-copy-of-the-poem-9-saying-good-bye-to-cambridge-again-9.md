<code><strong>The original text 原文</strong></code>

<b>再别康桥</b>
轻轻的我走了，
正如我轻轻的来；
我轻轻的招手，
作别西天的云彩。

那河畔的金柳，
是夕阳中的新娘；
波光里的艳影，
在我的心头荡漾。

软泥上的青荇，
油油的在水底招摇；
在康河的柔波里，
我甘心做一条水草！

那榆荫下的一潭，
不是清泉，是天上虹；
揉碎在浮藻间，
沉淀着彩虹似的梦。

寻梦？撑一支长篙，
向青草更青处漫溯；
满载一船星辉，
在星辉斑斓里放歌。

但我不能放歌，
悄悄是别离的笙箫；  
夏虫也为我沉默，
沉默是今晚的康桥！

悄悄的我走了，
正如我悄悄的来；
我挥一挥衣袖，
不带走一片云彩。
****
<code><strong>Translation version 译文</strong></code>

<b>Saying Good-bye to Cambridge Again</b>
Very quietly I take my leave 
As quietly as I came here; 
Quietly I wave good-bye 
To the rosy clouds in the western sky. 

The golden willows by the riverside
Are young brides in the setting sun;
Their reflections on the shimmering waves
Always linger in the depth of my heart.

The floating heart growing in the sludge 
Sways leisurely under the water; 
In the gentle waves of Cambridge 
I would be a water plant!    

That pool under the shade of elm trees 
Holds not water but the rainbow from the sky; 
Shattered to pieces among the duckweeds
Is the sediment of a rainbow-like dream.    

To seek a dream? Just to pole a boat upstream 
To where the green grass is more verdant; 
Or to have the boat fully loaded with starlight 
And sing aloud in the splendor of starlight.    

But I cannot sing aloud 
Quietness is my farewell music; 
Even summer insects heap silence for me 
Silent is Cambridge tonight!   

Very quietly I take my leave
As quietly as I came here;
Gently I flick my sleeves 
Not even a wisp of cloud will I bring away.

The following is part of my handwritten copy of this poem.
以下是我的手抄本（节选）。

This lyric poem was written in 1928 when Xu Zhimo revisited Cambridge, which expresses the love for Cambridge. At that time, he was reluctant to leave there. The sentence in this poem---<i>I would be a water plant</i> ---shows the quietness and freedom of the Rriver Cam, through which the author expresses his longing for a good life. At the same time, he desired to return to the past. The first paragraph echoes with the last one, which adds to its rhythm.  In fact, this poem is not only considered as a farewell to Cambridge,but also to the culture and ideal life of  Cambridge. It is  far-reaching and the masterpiece of Xi Zhimo.
<blockquote>这首诗是徐志摩在1928年重游剑桥写下的一首抒情诗，抒发了对康桥离别的不舍之情。诗中那句“我甘心做一条水草”可以看出康河的明静和自由自在，寄托出作者对自由美好生活的向往。同时，也表现出作者对昔日生活的憧憬。诗中第一段和最后一段相互照应，加强了文章的节奏感。其实，这首诗不仅是告别康桥，更多地是对康桥文化和理想生活的告别，可谓意义深远，是徐志摩诗作中的绝唱。</blockquote>
