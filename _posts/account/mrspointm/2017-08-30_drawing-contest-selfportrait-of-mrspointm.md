Last night, I happened to see that  @nicolemoker held a competition which was to draw a selfpotrait. At that moment, I had a great interest.  After thinking for a while,  it seemed that I had never drawn a picture of myself, for it was difficult to do this.  But I think it is not the result but the process that counts most, so I took part in it.  With the colored pencils left in the office, I  just used the only pencil at home to draw this picture.
<blockquote>昨天晚上看到 @nicolemoker举办的<a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@nicolemoker/usd50-sbd-competition-lucky-draw-celebration-for-50-days-in-steemit-50-steemit#@mrspointm/re-nicolemoker-usd50-sbd-competition-lucky-draw-celebration-for-50-days-in-steemit-50-steemit-20170829t140159586z">$50 SBD Competition + Lucky Draw</a>的绘画比赛，当时非常感兴趣，但想了又想我好像从来没有画过自己，毕竟画人物真的太难了！不过，还是抱着重点参与的态度试了一试。昨晚回了趟家，没有带彩铅笔，于是只好用家里唯一一支铅笔开始画起来。</blockquote>

#### The process 过程图
It took me about 1.5 hours to draw this one. First, draw an outline of the whole figure. Then, draw from the hair to the five sense organs. Last, draw the clothes and accessories. PS: For a person who is in the primary level,  <del>it can be considered the best.</del>
<blockquote>先将轮廓画出后，再到头发，五官，以及衣服配饰。ps: 对于一个初级水平的人来说，能画成这样已经是人品大爆发啦！</blockquote>
