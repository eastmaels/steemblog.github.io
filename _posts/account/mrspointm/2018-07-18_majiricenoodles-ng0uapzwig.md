Rice noodles are a kind of classic snacks in southern China, now widely loved by our locals. The most famous is Guo Qiao Rice Noodles in Yunnan, but such rice noodles in Sichuan also taste good,with chili added. Today, I'd like to recommend a restaurant known for its rice noodles in my hometown Leshan, which is named Ma Ji Rice Noodles.

米线是经典的南方小吃，如今广受全国百姓的喜爱。最著名的莫过于云南的过桥米线，但四川米线的味道也非常棒，搭配四川的香辣味，别有一番风味。今天将为朋友们推荐一家来自我家乡乐山的米线店—马记米线。

This restaurant has been around for a few years and its taste has been maintained throughout the years. With the popularity of online promotion, the business works better. I think all the foodies know that whether the restairant is delicate or not, the best support for a restaurant is the special taste, which can be considered the main reason for the popularity. Next, let's take a look at what've ordered!

这家米线店已有些年头，这些年马记米线的味道一直保持着，随着网络宣传的流行，生意更是火爆。但所有吃货们都懂，无论店铺精致与否，一个餐厅最好的支撑是味道，可能这也是这家米线店受欢迎的最大原因。接下来，请大家欣赏这些美食。

<p><center><strong>Rice Noodles with Crispy Meat 酥肉米线</strong></center></p>
Crispy meat is also very popular in Sichuan, and often mixed with rice noodles, making this dish delicious. Crispy meat must be made of pork belly. When chewing it together with rice noodles, absolutely wonderful!

酥肉也是在我们四川非常受欢迎的食物，也经常会与米线搭配在一起，这样一份酥肉米线简直是人间美味。而酥肉一定要半肥半瘦，与滑滑嫩嫩的米线嚼在一起，口感极佳。

<center><strong>Guo Qiao Rice Noodles 过桥米线</strong></center></p>
Guo Qiao Rice Noodles are to Yunnan what hot pot is for Sichuan, both of which belong to representatives of classic food. The rice noodles here is more suitable for the people in Sichuan. It is sour and spicy. After enjoying the rice noodles, you can drink the soup inside.

过桥米线就对于云南就像火锅对于四川，都是美食的经典代表。马记米线的过桥米线，更适合四川人的口味，酸辣麻俱有，吃了米线后再喝一口汤，回味无穷。

<center><strong>Rice Noodles with Pork Ribs 排骨米线</strong></center></p>
This dish is what I ordered, tasting good. Among such rice noodles, it is not the best one but includes so many ribs inside.

这份米线是我点的，味道不错，不过在这几份米线中，它算不上翘楚，但排骨量多。

<center><strong>Beef Rice Noodles with Raw Chili 生椒牛肉米线</strong></center></p>
I have eaten beef noodles with rice chili before, whose taste makes me unforgettable. Surprisingly, beef mixed with raw chili is really a perfect match for rice noodles. The beef is cut into small pieces and added to rice noodles, brilliant!

以前吃过的生椒牛肉面，其美味令我难以忘怀，惊喜的是，生椒牛肉同样适用于米线，且是另一番风味。牛肉大小适中，切成小片，与米线混合在一起，此乃美味。

Leshan is a popular tourist city, not only known for its beautiful scenery, but also for attractive food. If you visit Sichuan one day, don't miss this good place —Leshan. If you want to explore delicacies here, you might as well go there!

乐山是个比较热门的旅游城市，不仅是风景优美，美食也是非常吸引人的。假使有一天，你们来四川玩，一定不要错过乐山这个好地方，又假如想要领略乐山的美食，不妨去今天我推荐的马记米线尝一尝！
