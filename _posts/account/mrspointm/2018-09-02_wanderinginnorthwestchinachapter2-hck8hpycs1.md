<strong>Hi, steemit friends!💙</strong>

The first day in Qinghai was too tiring, perhaps because of long-term fatigue of travel, or  because we couldn't adapt to this high-altitude area immediately. We went to sleep very early that night.

<center>_Day 2 Heima River → Chaka Salt Lake → Fuicui Lake_</center>

<strong>Heima River</strong>

The next morning, we were awakened by the owner of the B&amp;B at around 6 to watch the sunrise. The location of this B&amp;B is quite good, which is in the center of the grassland and close to the river. As can be seen from the photo, it is a great place to enjoy the sunrise. This was the first time we had seen the sunrise and witnessed this fantastic moment. We were really shocked by this natural landscape.

The rising sun was not glaring. Instead,  it touched the entire grassland with its warm light, and drove away coldness. After that, we hurried to leave for Chaka Salt Lake, around 100 kilometers away. It was a new day. We all were looking forward.

Looking out of the car window, we could see the mountains and sometimes there were hundreds of sheep grazing on the hillside leisurely. Without herdsmen accompanying them, this place was their paradise. Soon, we arrived at the popular tourist attraction—Chaka Salt Lake.

<hr />

<strong>Chaka Salt Lake</strong>

The Chaka Salt Lake is located between two mountains. The mountains are covered with snow all the year round. The snow-capped mountains are reflected on the surface of the lake, forming a unique natural view of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau where the water and the sky meet.

When we came to the salt area, we saw many salt sculptures. This salt sculpture in the photo is named <b>_The Legend Genghis Khan_</b>, 50m long, 30m wide and 8m high, using 4,800t salt. The sculpture is spectacular, representing the nobility and aggressiveness of the legend Genghis Khan; with innovative and unique artistic methods, it displays the marvelous spectacle, perfectly integrates the salt and sculpture art.

Along the way, we stepped on the road covered with salt crystals as if it were snow. The Chaka Salt Lake was really gorgeous. The endless lake, blue sky and white clouds combined to compose such beautiful scenery. But there were too many tourists, and even to take photos was difficult.

It is worth mentioning that there is a lively shopping street in the exit of Chaka Salt Lake Scenic Area. When tourists are tired, they can rest here, eating food or buying special products.

Our next stop was to Feicui Lake in Da Qaidam, which was also a salt lake. Compared with the lively Chaka Salt Lake, it was totally different.

<hr />

<strong>Fuicui Lake</strong>

There were fewer tourists visiting here, for this Lake was relatively remote. As for me, it was more beautiful than Chaka Salt Lake.

<img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUowLtBMFQGXZ5VQnvj1Nu4zjrCqyRk8Bkb3dwCuPJnPV/IMG_8229.JPG" alt="IMG_8229.JPG" /><br/>

The water in Feicui Lake is very clear, just like the shallow sea water. The most important is that the salt lake is not surrounded by any modern elements, as if we came to an unexploited land. This is completely a magnifcent and mysterious world of nature.

That night, we stayed at Da Qaidam and still found a Szechuan Restaurant which offered delicious hometown dishes. Recalling the previous travel to Phuket, I realized that if I coudn't find any tasty meals during the travel, I wouldn’t have the energy to appreciate the gorgeous scenery.

来到青海的第一天实在太疲倦了，或许是由于舟车劳顿，也可能是因为突然来到海拔较高的地方还不太适应，所以这天晚上很早我们就入睡了。

第二天的清晨，六点钟我们就被民宿主人叫醒，只为看到黑马河的日出。民宿的地理位置真的非常好，处于草地中心，离河边非常近，是欣赏日出的绝佳地点。这是我们第一次看见日出，亲眼见证这一刻，真的被这自然的景观所震撼。

初升的太阳并不刺眼，它带着温暖的光抚摸着整片草原，将干冷的气息赶走。看过日出，我们又匆匆出发，离开黑马河驶向近百公里的茶卡盐湖，又是一天新的路程，我们满怀则期待。

望着车窗外飞驰而过的山体，偶尔可以看见数百只草原羊遍布在山坡无忧无虑地吃草，且看不到牧民的身影，这里称得上是它们自由的港湾了。很快，就抵达茶卡盐湖。

茶卡盐湖夹在两山之间，山上常年积雪，雪山倒影在湖面，形成水天相交的青藏高原独特自然风光。一走到盐区，便能看见许多用盐晶堆建而成的塑像一走到盐区，便能看见许多用盐晶堆建而成的塑像。照片上的这座盐雕叫作<strong>《一代天骄成吉思汗》</strong>，长50米、宽30米、高8米，耗盐量4800吨。整座雕塑恢弘壮观，体现了一代天骄成吉思汗成就霸业、惟我独尊的王者风范；经过创新和独特的艺术手法展现出迷人的艺术奇观，它实现了盐和雕塑艺术的完美结合。

一路上都是盐晶铺出来的路，踩起来嘎吱响，一眼望去就好像洁白的积雪。茶卡盐湖真的很漂亮，一望无际的湖水与蓝天白云相得益彰，美中不足就是游客实在太多了，连拍照都不方便。

值得一提的是，茶卡盐湖景区出口便有一条热闹非凡的购物街，游客在里面玩累了出来便可以吃美食买点特产，绝佳的商机啊。接下来是数百公里的赶路时间，下一个景点是大柴旦的翡翠湖，那里也是盐湖，而比起热闹非凡的茶卡盐湖，它又是另外一番景象。

翡翠湖比较偏远，来这里的游客相对较少，但我打心眼里觉得这里比茶卡盐湖更美。翡翠湖的水非常清澈，就像浅浅的海水一般碧绿，最重要的是周围没有任何现代元素的建筑物，远处除了山就是山，那种感觉就像来到一处无人开采的自然之地，完全是气势宏大，神秘深幽的自然之镜。

第二晚就近在大柴旦过夜，镇上的环境还算不错，晚上依然找了一家川菜馆用餐，仍是觉得家乡菜合胃口。回想起前不久的普吉岛之行，领悟到如果在外旅行若是吃不好，再美的景色也没有精力去欣赏。

最后分享在翡翠湖拍的短视频，希望大家喜欢。未完待续...
