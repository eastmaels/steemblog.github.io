Theme: Daily Food

Location: Leshan, China

Camera used: iPhone 6

This kind of food can be found in any city around Sichuan, which may be derived from Leshan(a city). It's very convenient to make it. We consider it as a snack. There are a wide variety of dishes, such as squid, sausage, beef, photo, broccoli etc. Each stall has its own unique feature.
>这种小吃遍布四川各个城市，具体应该是从乐山流传开来。其特点是简易方便，品种多，鱿鱼、腊肠、牛肉、土豆、西蓝花... 各个小摊口味不同，各有特色。
