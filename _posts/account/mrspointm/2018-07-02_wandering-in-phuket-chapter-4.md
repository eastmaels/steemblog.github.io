On the fifth day of Phuket, we still chose a one-day local tour with the tour guide. We were to go to the sea that day, so both of us felt quite excited. For the first time, we were so close to the sea. At around 7 am, we hurriedly finished breakfast and waited for the driver to pick us up in the lobby. I have to mention that drivers in Phuket always offer service of high quality. Besides, we never met a late-running car.
>在普吉岛的第五天，依然是跟团游。由于今天会出海，所以我们都超级兴奋，第一次如此亲近大海。早晨七点过，我们匆匆吃过早餐后在大厅坐等司机来接我们。不得不说普吉岛的司机效率几乎都很高，我们这些天都没遇到过晚点的车，并且司机师傅的服务态度都很不错。

We booked this trip offered by the company named Seastar on Ctrip. We were satisfied with all kinds of services in the whole process, except for one thing. They didn't remind us of what we need to prepare in advance, such as mobile phone waterproof bag, beach socks and swimsuit. What I had originally thought was that even if I  went out to the sea, I could stay at the yacht instead of diving into the water. I could play on the beach. In fact, this trip was aimed at offering snorkeling service. Therefore, it is necessary for you to bring relevant swiming gear.
>在携程上订的Seastar出海一日游，全程所有的服务我们都很满意，但唯独有一点，就是没有提醒我们需要准备什么，比如手机防水袋、沙滩袜、泳衣。因为我最初想的是就算要出海我也可以不下水，就在沙滩上玩也可以，没想到这个行程不下水就没意思了，所以在此提醒大家出海游一定要带好游泳装备。

**Fascinating underwater world 迷人的海底世界**

When we arrived Koh Phi Phi Leh, the first thing was to snorkel in the shallow area near the island. Colorful fishes  swam around and corals of different shapes could be seen everywhere. I always wanted to touch the fishes with my hands, but they always swam quickly. Unfortunately, there was no mobile phone waterproof bag with me.  Otherwise, I could have recorded the beautiful scene.
>第一个项目就是在小皮皮岛附近的浅海区浮潜，五颜六色小鱼就在身边游来游去，海底全是形状各异的珊瑚，总想用手去触摸小鱼们，但它们总会迅速游走。很可惜没有携带手机防水袋，不然一定要记录下那美丽的场景。

Those who want to go snorkeling do not be too confident about your swimming skills. Although this is relatively simple, you have to listen carefully to the tour guide, keeping not too far from the group. In the past, I only experienced seawater near the beach, but I felt the turbulence of the sea just a few meters deeper. I was about to board the yacht when a sudden wind came. We managed to get on the yacht, still scared.
>想去浮潜的朋友，虽然这是一项比较简单的项目，但也不要对自己的游泳技术太自信，一是要仔细听导游讲解，而是不要离人群太远。以前只是在沙滩上体验过海水，但真在几米深的海水里才感觉大海的汹涌，快要上船的时候突然起了风浪，我们赶紧努力往船那边游，心里还是怕怕的。

**Maya Bay 玛雅湾**

This place was very gorgeous with no wind and no wave, and the verdurous water made me feel comfortable. As tour guide said, the depth of seawater here was about ten meters, which was suitable for diving. At the very beginning, I was still afraid to do it. After a while, I decided to have a try, for it would be a pity for me not to experience the process.Though my ears were hurt by the water pressure, it did leave a deep impression on me.
>这里很漂亮，无风无浪，碧绿的海水看起来很舒服。导游说这里的水深十米左右，很适合跳水，一开始我还是不敢的，但转念一想，好不容易来一趟不体验一下那不可惜了吗？虽然耳朵也因为水压弄得有些痛，不过这个体验感还是很足的。

**Monkey Beach 猴子海滩**
 
Then we went to see the monkeys. They were so clever that they could swim, which opened my eyes. The monkeys clung to the rock. When someone threw the food into the water, some of the monkeys would jump into it for food. It is said that  monkeys will only do so when he is hungry.
>之后我们去看了猴子，它们简直太机灵了，竟然会游泳，长见识了。猴子们攀附在岩壁上，有人把吃的扔进水里，就会有猴子跳进水里捡吃的，据说猴子饿了的时候才会这样做。

**Khai Island 鸡蛋岛**

This small island was our final stop of this trip. There are bars and restaurants run by the locals on the island, but they were old-fashioned. Most of us came here to play with water and took photographs.
>这个岛是本次行程的最后一站，它很小。岛上有当地人经营的酒吧和餐厅，不过都很老旧，我们大多数人都是来这里玩玩水拍拍照，不会久留。

The experience of that day was far more wonderful than my description. Despite insufficient sunshine, I felt it was not completely bad. Although the weather made the scenery look less beautiful, we didn't get sunburnt. When getting to the hotel, it was already dark. Happy and tired, I slept well that night and looked forward to the next day in Phuket.
>这一天所经历的远远比我文字描述的精彩。至于阳光不充足，我觉得不完全是坏处。虽然会使风景看起来没那么美，但即使没擦防晒霜也不那么容易晒伤。回到酒店都已经天黑了，又开心又疲倦，所以那一晚睡得很舒服，期待下一天的普吉岛。
