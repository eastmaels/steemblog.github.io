First, I want to clarify that  I am also a minnow. In fact, these tips are far from so-called strategies. I just want to share some tips summed up by myself when using this platform, especially with our friends in cn district.  Some others have referred to some similar ones  in their posts. But now, I want to make it more detailed.  I have made some preparations before and hope it does work for you. Maybe someone will ask why I can not become a big whale but a little bigger minnow. This is my answer---<i>Roman was not built in a day.</i>🌞
<blockquote>首先声明我也是一只小小鱼，其实谈不上什么策略，想要分享在steemit的这段时间所总结出来的一些小技巧给新人, 尤其是cn区的朋友。关于这个话题，应该有人写过类似的，对此我做了一些准备和归纳。希望对大家所有帮助。也许有人会问为什么是小鱼不是大鲸，我想回答罗马不是一天建成的。🌞</blockquote>

### 1.  A detailed self-introduction on steemit 一个完整的自我介绍
As the saying goes, well begun is half done. I still remembered the day  when I joined steemit. I was confused at that time, and later I learned that  a lot of friends that I followed have written a complete self-introduction post and their main tag is introduceyourself.  So a self-introduction is needed.  You are expected to give a more detailed introduction which can be related to your own interests and so on. 
 <b>ATTENTION:</b> 1. The first  picture that you shared in your post needs to be  your selfie, which makes it  more realistic.  2. Add the date of joining steemit, its logo and your account name to the picture, like <a href="https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@mrspointm/introduction-hi-steemit-i-m-a-new-comer-here-to-share-my-life-and-look-for-new-friends-steemit">Introduction: Hi，Steemit！ I'm a new comer here to share my life and look for new friends./ 大家好，我是Steemit的新人！</a>
<blockquote>一个好的开头是成功的一半。记得我当时刚入steemit的时候一头雾水，后来慢慢了解才发现关注的好多朋友都会有一个完整的自我介绍贴，主标签是introduceyourself。自我介绍尽量详尽，可以涉及到自己的兴趣爱好等。
注意：1. 第一张配图最好是自拍照，这样更真实。2. 附上加入steemit的日期，logo和你的账号名称。如：<a href="https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@mrspointm/introduction-hi-steemit-i-m-a-new-comer-here-to-share-my-life-and-look-for-new-friends-steemit">Introduction: Hi，Steemit！ I'm a new comer here to share my life and look for new friends./ 大家好，我是Steemit的新人！</a> </blockquote>

### 2.  Submit a post to @someone   投稿给 @someone
If you want to  accumulate your first bucket of gold and improve your own community influence, which can be understood as Rep Value, I think the best way is to contribute.  ATTENTION: 1. The article  is original, bilingual(Only for the languages of Chinese and English), and is first published. (You can not summbit articles posted on steemit before.) 2. Beautiful articles are needed.  Pay attention to the layout format, like <a href="https://steemit.com/travel/@someone/xiamen-impression-the-charm-of-egret-island---by-mrspointm">Xiamen Impression, the Charm of Egret Island by @mrspointm</a>. 3. If you write something about  food, culture and tourism, it will be given priority.  If you are interested, click <a href="https://steemit.com/cn/@someone/4uufa-and">here&nbsp;</a> to know more.
<blockquote>想要为自己积累第一桶金，提高自己的社区影响力，可以理解为rep值，我认为最好的方式就是投稿。但需要注意的有以下几点：1. 文章需要原创，中英双语，并且是首发。（不能发表已在steemit的文章）2. 文章尽量精美，注意排版格式。（可以参看已发表的文章格式，如<a href="https://steemit.com/travel/@someone/xiamen-impression-the-charm-of-egret-island---by-mrspointm">厦门印象，鹭岛风情 by @mrspointm</a>） 3. 最好的介绍美食，文化，旅游的，这些会优先发表。 具体参见<a href="https://steemit.com/cn/@someone/4uufa-and">中文社区内容推广计划框架(修正版) &amp; 试运行期优惠已截止&nbsp;</a></blockquote>

### 3. Take part in Google Calls the Roll contest hosted by @jubi     “谷歌点名”活动
Google Calls the Roll is more an activity than a contest. You can share your feelings with all of us. Now, it has come to the second stage. Each stage will give a topic once a week. All participants need to write an article around the topic, preferably written in Chinese and its style is not limited. Finally, if you post can be searched through Google and ranks the first three, you will be rewarded.   Of course,  Excellent awards are included.  I think this activity is brilliant for new steemians.  First, you do not worry about what to write. Second, you can get rewarded because of your article and are likely to win the prize. Moreover, @jubi will share the article of each participant, which increases the click rate of your post.  This time the topic is about "the first time". If you have an interest, you can click <a href="https://steemit.com/cn/@jubi/42wvdr">here</a> to know more.
<blockquote>与其说谷歌点名是比赛，不如说它是活动---分享感想。现在已进行到第二期，每一期会有一个话题，为期一周，参与者需要围绕话题写一篇文章，最好是中文，文体不限。最后以google搜索排名为准，当然也有优秀奖。：） 我认为这个活动对于新人来说是极好的，第一省去了选题的麻烦；第二既有文章原本的收入，也有最后的奖励；第三，jubi会将参与者的文章分享给大家，这样也增加了点击率，不是吗？感兴趣的朋友，可以一试。这一期主题是“第一次”。具体参见<a href="https://steemit.com/cn/@jubi/42wvdr">关于“谷哥点名”游戏的初步设想</a></blockquote>

### 5.  Write a series of good articles  写出优质文章---最好是连载文章
I personally think that writing a series of goodarticles can help everyone to know you better. Especially when in a large number of posts, they can recognize your post right now. Such as @sweetssj---her articles about Miss. Delicious and Travel with me, @mrpointp---There is always someone keeping working out and Never Say Goodbye, @cnfund---After Creation and My posts---Write a Poem for You---My handwritten copy of the poem  and so on.  Perhaps not all of us can get such a high income as Miss Sweetssj, but believe me that if you insist on writing, you can get a stable income.
<blockquote>我个人认为写一个系列的文章，可以让大家更好地认识你，在海量的帖子中一眼就能看到你的。比如 @sweetsssj 小姐姐的Miss. Delicious 和Travel with me 系列文章，又如 @mrpointp的《总有一个比你忙，比你穷，比你老的人在健身》系列和《不说再见说珍重》小说系列，还有 @cnfund的《创世之后》玄幻小说系列，还有我最近的一个系列---为你写诗，我的手抄诗歌 等等。也许不是所有人都会像甜心姐姐一样有那么高的收益，但只要坚持写下去一定会有很稳定的收益。</blockquote>

### 6.  Comment and upvote other steemians' posts 多与朋友们互动和点赞 
This is a free platform where you can communicate and interact with any friends. Sometimes, you read others' articles, you gain more inspiration and harvest. Getting along with others sincerely, you will be treated in the same way.
<blockquote>这是一个自由的平台，你可以跟任何朋友交流和互动。有时候多看看别人的文章，反而更有灵感和收获。抱着真心跟别人相处，别人也会同样对你的。</blockquote>
