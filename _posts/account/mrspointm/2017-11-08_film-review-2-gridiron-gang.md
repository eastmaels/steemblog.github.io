### Hi, steemit friends!💙

Several days ago, @mrpointp recommended me a movie called <i>Gridiron Gang</i>. On hearing it, I knew it was not my favorite type. One day, I had nothing to do but see a film, so I chose the one as he told me. When I searched the name, I found it was Dwayne Johnson who starred in this film. I had seen his films before, like <i>Fast & Furious</i>, which I thought was quite good. That’s the reason why I choose this film.   
>几天前，@mrpointp推荐了一部名叫《重振球风》的电影，一听名字我说算了吧，这不会是我喜欢的类型。有一天闲来无事找到这部电影，发现是巨石强森，之前看过他演的《速度与激情》第六、七、八部，觉得还蛮不错，干脆看一下这部《重振球风》吧。

To tell the truth, I have such feelings—one is touched, the other is shocked. This film is adapted from a real story. A group of juvenile offenders was confined to the juvenile center for committing crimes. Their chief manager, Sean Potter (casted by Dwayne Johnson), worked tirelessly to help these children. Suddenly, one day he had an idea to set up a rugby team. The leader in this center was not optimistic about this matter, but Potter had always insisted on persuading all the people until they are willing to create a way for these children with dark history.
>说真的看完之后有两大感受，一是感动二是震撼。这是一部由真实事迹改编的电影，影片讲述了一群因犯罪而关在少年感化中心的少年犯，他们的管理长官西恩.波特（巨石强森 饰）为感化这些孩子做着不懈的努力，突然有一天，他想到组建一支橄榄球队, 感化中心领导并不看好这件事，但波特教练一直坚持着说服所有人，直到人们愿意为这些有着黑暗历史的孩子创造一条路。

But the difficulty came from not just others. The biggest problem for Potter was these criminal juveniles.They were very rebellious and arrogant, some of whom even killed someone else. In Potter's mind, he had known how to communicate with these children before and I consider it a good way to stimulate them. He knew most of these children had never done anything well, which led to them being on the verge of crime. It's likely that theses children were eager for success most. One of the rugby team members said, " I have been tired of being a loser and I want to succeed." It was such a desire that made them more perseverant than ordinary people.
>可是困难不仅出自别人，这些犯罪少年才是波特教练的最大难题，他们十分叛逆嚣张，也有着严重的帮派之别，其中有的少年甚至是杀过人。波特教练用他早已预备好的方式与这些孩子沟通，我理解为“激将法”，他知道这些孩子大多数从来就没有做好一件事，反而走上了犯罪的道路，所以他们才是最渴望成功的人。其中一个队员说道：“当失败者已经当腻了，我想尝尝成功的滋味。”可能正是因为这种渴望，他们才会有比常人更坚毅的心。

Later in this season, this team called Mustang won the second prize, but in the hearts of all, they were already champions. Most importantly, after they walked out of the juvenile detention center, most of them were on the right track and only five were in jail, which was much better than before.
>后来在这次赛季中，这支名叫“野马”的队伍赢得了亚军，但在所有人心中他们已经是冠军了。最重要的是，他们走出感化中心后，其中大部分人走上了正途，只有五个人进了监狱，这已经比之前的情况好太多了。

This is a very infectious movie, it wants to tell the audience even if you failed, never never give up. Anything is possible.
>这是一部感染力极强的电影，它想告诉观众就算你失败过，也永远不要放弃自己。一切皆有可能。
