## Hi, steemit friends!💙
My impression of Thai film has been immersed in the influence of Tony Jaa. In my memory, Thailand favors making films about gangsters and martial arts, but this film named <i>Bad Genius</i> really opened my eyes.

Picture from weibo.cn

A talented girl Xiaolin, from an ordinary family, entered a local aristocratic school under the guidance of his father, where she met the wealthy Grace and rich second-generation Pat. In an exam, Xiaolin first risked helping Grace by exchanging her shoe with Grace, for the shoe contained the right answer, which impressed me a lot. Later, Pat, the boyfriend of Grace and several other students also wanted to be helped by Xiaolin by paying her money. Because of its huge profits, Xiaolin agreed. At this point, the film reached the first climax. Xiao Lin invented the cheating way of using the figures on the piano to create different gestures that stand for A, B, C and D separately. From the beginning to the end, I did not realize her fingering, but I really admired the heroine.

However, not everything went smoothly To prevent students cheating in the exam, this school  had prepared two sets of papers. When taking the exam, each students would given different papers. Thus, this leaded to failure of the original arrangements for cheating. Here came the second climax of the film. The changed way of cheating had been succeeded, but another genius boy Benjamin reported them to the headmaster, which made Xiao Lin's scholarship removed and his father know her cheating behavior for making money. And the last climax in this film is the highlight of the whole story. Xiaolin and Benjamin together with Grace and Pat planned to cheat in another exam STIC, an international exam for studying abroad. Well, I will not reveal too much. Anyway, it's really very exciting.

The film is something like a spy movie, especially when examiner was chasing Xiaolin in the subway station, creating a tense atmosphere. I've no idea whether it is for the film or the education in Thailand is like this. I feel senior high students in China are not particularly anxious about failing in the exam. I think this film has its instructive meaning, that is, cheating can make you succeed temporarily but you can not rely on others forever. In addition, I personally really like the actors in this film. Although very young, they are so professional and has acted out the characters so vividly.

That day, when @mrpointp and I got to the cinema,  the audiences below were only two of us, which was just like we had booked the whole theater, lol... In short, the film is worth seeing.

致cn区的朋友们：
我对泰国电影的印象一直还沉浸在托尼贾的影响下，一直感觉泰国喜欢拍黑帮片和武打片，但《天才枪手》真的让我大开眼界！

家境平凡的天才少女小琳在爸爸的引导下进入当地一个贵族学校(可申请留学助学金)，在那里她认识了家境富裕的格蕾丝以及富二代帕特。为了帮助格蕾丝顺利通过考试，小琳第一次冒险帮助她作弊，用鞋子作弊我也真的是佩服。后来富二代帕特以及另外几个同学也想受到小琳的帮助，并且是有偿的，小琳因为金钱的原因冒险答应了下来。此时电影达到了第一个高潮，小琳发明了钢琴手法作弊的方式，以不同的手势表示A,B,C,D四个答案，虽然从头到尾我也没看到她的指法，但我不得不佩服女主角。

好景不长，学校为了防止作弊，作用抽题的方式分配试卷，这就会导致原本安排好的作弊方式毁于一旦，这时电影进入了第二个高潮。本来作弊成功，但是半路杀出另一个天才少年班克正义地把他们举报了，这使得小琳的留学助学金目标破灭并且还被父亲发现她以作弊盈利的行径。电影最精彩的剧情也就是最后一个高潮，小琳和班克等人策划了场“跨国作弊”，这个嘛，我就不给大家透露剧情了，反正真的非常精彩。

这部电影简直拍得像谍战片，尤其是小琳被考官在地铁站追逃的时候，为整部电影营造了紧张的气氛。不知道是不是为了电影效果还是泰国那边的教育真的如此，我感觉在中国高中时期学生并没有那么紧张考试不及格。我认为这部电影应该是教育类的，就是为了告诉大家一个道理，作弊只能保你一时，保不了你一世，人终究要靠自己的！另外我个人真的很喜欢这部电影的演员，虽然都很年轻，但每个人的演技都很好，作弊的那种紧张表现得淋漓尽致。

那天和 @mrpointp看这部电影的时候，全场只有我们两个人，简直是包场了…总而言之，这部电影值得一看！
