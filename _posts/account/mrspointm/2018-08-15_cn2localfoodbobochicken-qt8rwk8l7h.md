<strong>Hi, steemit friends!💙</strong>

Maybe you have heard of Sichuan-style skewers or Malatang(something like hot pot), but you may not know that they still exist in another form, that is, the "Bobo Chicken" that originated from Leshan.

Bobo chicken, which has existed since the Qing dynasty, is one of the traditional snacks in Chengdu and Leshan. In our dialect, "bobo" means crock pots. The outside of the crock is beautifully painted with dragon symbols. To make this snack, some spicy condiments are needed to put in the crock.

Then some dishes must be specially processed and held up with the bamboo skewers. After the dishes cool down, people put them into the crock. In summer, we always choose this snack, because it tastes good and doesn't burn the mouth.

When speaking of its name, most people may think there is only chicken inside! In fact, the ingredients in the pot are diverse, such as boneless chicken feet, pork bellies, beef, quail eggs, pigskin and duck intestines, etc. The vegetarian dishes include fungus, bamboo shoots and lettuce, etc. I can say that almost all the ingredients we usually like to eat can be made into the pot.

<strong><em>In addition to spicy soup, the soup with the taste of the Zanthoxylum schinifolium etzucc is also very popular</em></strong>, and another kind of soup with sesame flavor is suitable for people who do not like spicy food. It is said that the key to the delicious bobo chicken lies in its oil made of Zanthoxylum schinifolium etzucc. The unique scent makes the soup quite delicious, while the pepper oil and chili oil easily lead to excessive internal heat.

If you come to Leshan, you will find almost everyone eating this food with this local drink (as you can see from the picture above) on the table.

Compared with Sichuan-style skewers(something like hot pot), bobo chicken won’t make you sweat while eating. In Leshan, you can always find restaurants that offer bobo chicken, but if you want to enjoy the best one, you’d better go to popular food destinations such as Leshan Port and Old Park.

As for me, bobo chicken can represent one of the traditional dishes in Leshan. It's just like hot pot can represent Sichuan and Chongqing cuisine. It is a symbol of a city. If you have a chance to visit here, do have a try.

Finally, I want to say thanks to @abcallen for holding such a great food contest. If you have an interest in it, please click <a href="https://steemit.com/cn/@abcallen/cn-2-or-2018-8-1-8-31">here</a>.

也许你知道四川的串串香或者麻辣烫，但可能你还不知道他们还以另外一种形式存在着，那就是起源于乐山的“钵钵鸡”。

钵钵鸡,清代就已经存在,是四川成都和乐山的传统小吃。“钵钵”其实就是瓦罐，钵外面是画着红黄相间的瓷质龙纹，钵内盛放配以麻辣为主的佐料。菜品在特殊加工后用签串制，晾冷浸于各种口味的佐料中。在夏天，我们通常会选择品尝钵钵鸡，因为真的是太美味了,而且不烫嘴。

光听名字，大家一定认为里面只有鸡肉吧！其实钵钵鸡的食材多种多样，有荤有素。荤菜有无骨鸡爪、猪肚、牛肉、鹌鹑蛋、猪皮、鸭肠等，素菜有木耳、笋子、莴笋等，可以说几乎平常我们会吃到的食材都可以制成钵钵鸡。

<strong>除了麻辣味的汤料，藤椒味也十分受欢迎</strong>，芝麻味适合不喜欢吃辣的人。据说钵钵鸡美味的关键就在于藤椒油，那独特的香味使汤料变得十分鲜美，而花椒油和辣椒油容易让人上火。

如果来乐山，你会发现几乎每个人吃着这种小吃，桌上放着一瓶峨眉雪（正如上图可见）。

与滚烫的串串香相比，钵钵鸡不会让人边吃边冒汗。在乐山，几乎到处都能找到做钵钵鸡的餐馆，但想要吃味道更好的钵钵鸡，最好还是往热门的美食地，例如乐山港和老公园附近。钵钵鸡完全可以以家乡菜代表乐山美食，就像火锅可以代表四川和重庆美食一样，是一座城市的标志，欢迎朋友们来此品尝钵钵鸡。
