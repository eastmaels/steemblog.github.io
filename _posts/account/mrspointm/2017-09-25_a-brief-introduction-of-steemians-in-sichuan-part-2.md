#### Hi, steemit friends!💙

Welcome to my post. Last week, I introduced part of the steemians that I know in Sichuan, which has received such amazing encouragement and support! I really appreciate it.  Through my <a href="https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@mrspointm/a-brief-introduction-of-steemians-in-sichuan-part-1">previous post</a>, you may have known some of our members, such @cnfund, @lymichale and @acactus1013.  With time passing, an increasing number of people join us in sharing their thoughts or feelings on this steemit platform.  Now, here is some detailed information for you to know other members better. Let's begin!


### Introduction of the Steemians in Sichuan
<blockquote>Now I am going to introduce them and their post series one by one. If you are interested, feel free to follow them.</blockquote>

@mrpointp is my boyfriend who is very easygoing and kind. Sometimes, he is a funny guy.  It has been nearly three months since he came here. During the time, he likes watching movies, working out and writing novels, which can be seen from his posts. Sometimes, he shares his daily life with us. Also, he is a foodie, accompanying me to enjoy various delicious food.  After he began his trip here, he was always recommending this platform to me, so I'm here now.  He has written an original novel called <i>Never Say Goodbye</i> for about 29 chapters, which is to be continued.  Besides, his daily bodybuilding has been recorded for about 33 chapters, which impress me most.  It's amazing! His post series include:

@lingliao is a teacher working in a senior high school (as you can see from the background of the photo) and now she sits opposite to me in our office. She is very serious about her work and patient with her students. When I first came to this school, she gave me a lot of help. Our colleagues think of her as a girl who loves planting flowers so much. These plants can be seen everywhere in her home and even in our office. These days, she has been ill and doesn't write much.  In the following days, she will share more about her daily life with us. Her post series include:

Now, it's time for me to introduce myself, @mrspointm. I'm the one who is responsible for communication with our group.  I am also a teacher who are crazy about travelling, poem and painting. Also, I am a foodie.  I like to take part in different activities held by the people in cn district, such as @jubi, @helene, @rivalhw and so on. This platform has given me a chance to slow down, look back on my life and reflect on what I have done before. I feel so lucky to be here. My post series include:

亲爱的steemit朋友们，又到了介绍我们四川小分队成员环节了。不知道大家有没有对谁印象比较深刻的呢？ @mrpointp 是一个电影迷，同时热衷于健身，写过小说，也喜欢在这个平台分享自己的一些观点。如果对健身感兴趣的朋友，不妨关注一下他，互相交流下心得。 @lingliao是一位高中老师，她对工作一丝不苟，对学生和蔼可亲。在生活中，我们给她取了一个绰号“花痴”，但此花痴非比花痴。那是因为她十分喜欢养各种花草植物，她家里和办公室到处都摆满了她养的各种植物，在她的文章中也分享到了对花的喜爱。如果你跟她有同样的兴趣，不妨多关注关注。至于我 @mrspointm，自认为兴趣广泛，喜欢接受新事物，从我发的帖可以看出，没有特别单一的喜好。一直在连载中的是我的为你写诗系列，以及我去各地寻觅美食的日志。我是一个典型的吃货，如果你也跟我一样，不妨一起寻觅来自大自然的馈赠。

我们的小分队目前人数很少，但还在积极的宣传中，以上的作者都是互相认识的朋友。我们会继续从不同领域和不同方向为大带来精彩内容，一起壮大我们的cn区，记得follow他们喔。 如果有四川的steemians，可以跟我联系，我们随时也欢迎你加入到小分队中来，一起弘扬四川文化，尤其是传统美食。最近有一个小计划，打算组织一次属于四川区的小型聚会，还在讨论中。如果大家愿意来的话，也可以联系到我本人，我们相聚成都，不见不散。注：上一帖的介绍收益已均分给了各位作者。（如上图）

## 备注：帖子所得SBD所有收益将会均分给以上作者。
