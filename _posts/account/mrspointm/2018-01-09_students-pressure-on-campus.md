#### Hi, steemit friends!💙
As we all know, students at each stage have their own unique label. For example, a college student's label is to enjoy the campus life and get a job, while a high school one is linked to this word "bitter". This bitterness and the bitter experience experienced in society belong to different concepts that are usually incomparable. I always hear the elderly friends sigh that when they were young, they met  tough conditions while now our teenagers are living a better life. Logically speaking, it is right now that teenagers should be more content and delighted.  They are thought to be more mature than we were in the past, however, it is not the truth.

Here are two things that I witnessed and they both happened in my class.

<b>The 1st one</b>

It is ridiculous to say that the conflict resulted from a "fart." One day, students in my class were doing morning reading when a girl inadvertently broke wind. (In fact, I personally think that this act is embarrassing, but it is common and not worth discussing.) Thus it caused some students in the class whispered and began to talk about and even laughed at the girl. Something happened like a volcano that had been accumulating for many years. Suddenly, the girl stood up in class and said to the talkers behind her,"It's just me!" Then she rushed out of the classroom. To comfort her, I followed and caught up with her. At this time, the girl burst into tears.

After she was emotionally stable, I chatted with her, and from her words I learned that she did this not just because of the gossips from her classmates but because faced with the pressure in  the coming entrance examination, she can not bear this matter. I am so sad, for she is just a teenager who should have lived in a simple and happy environment, but the pressure on her is beyond my imagination. Some come from school, or the family, others may be from surroundings including the classmates and friends around.

<b>The 2nd one</b>

This is a conflict that has been stopped in time, and I do not know how it would develop if there was no one. Maybe we have experienced the problems about seats during our school days. Sometimes we think our position is too narrow, which makes us to remind the back or front classmate to move his or her desk. This is a very common interpersonal communication. The similar situation happened to a boy and a girl in my class The boy sitting behind used to straighten his legs, perhaps touching the chair of the girl in front of him, and she felt she had narrow space. From the initial complaints to the dispute, the boy suddenly stood up, threw books to the girl and even prepared to lift up their chairs. I went forward to stop the boy. I do not know whether the boy will really do that. If so, he will make himself regretful in the future.

I am neither an educator nor a psychologist. I can not specifically analyze what problems exist among students. I only know that students' pressure is on the increase because of high demands on academic qualifications in our society. Now there are many postgraduates and college students can be seen everywhere. The college entrance examination is cruel, and always eliminates some people. I have seen some of them who tried hard but never achieved their goals.

Especially after chatting with that girl, I find that we should pay more attention to students' psychological problems than to impart knowledge to help students improve their grades. We admire Confucius as the Master, so we should integrate the essence into our present education. The so-called "education" is "teaching knowledge and educating people!" In addition to focusing on the development of children's IQ and the accumulation of knowledge, but also we should transfer some educational resources to improving quality education and emotional intelligence.

(PS: Above are my personal thoughts.)

每个阶段的学生，都有各自特有的标签。比如大学生的标签就是“就业”，而高中生的特有标签就是“苦”，这种苦与在社会上经历的苦是两个概念，通常无法比较。常听年长一点的朋友或是长辈说，想当年我们小的时候条件多么多么艰苦，现在的娃娃多好，如何如何...按道理说，是不是现在的孩子应该更加知足，会更容易感到幸福，也会更听话和懂事呢，然而现实中的情况与理论背道而驰。

讲述两件我亲眼见到的事情，就发生在我所任课的班级。

<b>一</b>

说起来实在可笑，这件事的导火索是一个“屁”。那是某一天的早自习，一位女生不经意间放了个屁（其实个人认为这种事虽然比较尴尬，但也再寻常不过了，根本不值得议论），于是这就引起了班上一些学生低声议论。同学们开始在议论甚至嘲笑那个女生，就像是一座蓄积多年的火山，女生就在课堂上突然站了起来冲着那些议论者说道：“就是我放的，那又怎么样！？”话音刚落，女生冲出了教室，于是我赶紧跟出去看了看，接着那个女生哭了起来。

待她情绪稳定后，我同她聊天，在她的话语中我了解到之所以她会“爆发”出来，不只是因为刚刚同学们的议论，是因为许许多多的压力堆积在一起让她实在无法容忍别人的指指点点。我很难过，因为她只是一个十几岁的孩子，本该生活在一个单纯又幸福的环境，可是身上背负的压力却是我从未想到的，有的来源于学业，有的来源于家庭或是身边的同学和朋友。

<b>二</b>

这是一场被及时阻止的冲突，我不知道若是当时没有人去阻拦事情会发展成怎么样。也许我们学生时代都经历过座位的前后问题，有时候我们觉得自己的位置太窄了，会提醒后面或前面的同学移一下，这就是一个很简单的人际交流问题。事情的主角是一个男生和一个女生，而冲突的起因就是座位的问题。坐在后面的男生喜欢把腿伸直了，或许是触碰到女生的椅子，而女生又觉得自己座位空间太小，于是从最初的抱怨上升到争执，突然，男生站了起来把书扔向女生并准备举起椅子。在他们争执的时候就引起了我的注意，我见情况不太好，立刻上去拉住了男生。不知道那个男生会不会真的打下去，但我知道他如果真的动了手一定会令他后悔一生。

我不是教育家，更不是心理学家，我无法具体分析，现在的学生们出现种种的问题到底是因为什么。我只知道现在的学生压力越来越大，因为这个社会对学历的要求越来越高，我父母那个年代，念一个专科就已经很优秀了（我仅了解四川这边的情况），而现在研究生都是“一抓一大把”，本科生更是遍地都是。而高考是残酷的，总会淘汰一部分人，我见过太多很努力却未达到自己目标的学生。

尤其在与那位女生聊天后，我发现相比传授知识帮助学生们提高成绩，我们是不是应该同时重视学生们的心理问题？我们崇尚着万师之表孔子，所以更应该将精华理念真实融入现在的教育中。所谓“教育”，乃“教书并育人”！我认为教育除了注重开发孩子们的智商和完成知识的积累，也应该把一定的教育资源转移到提高素质教育和情商这两方面。
