**Hi, steemit friends!**💙

Throughout the night, I always felt the strong wind blowing my tent. Looking out of the tent, I could appreciate the hazy moonlight, which made me impressed and satisfied, for I'd never got so close to nature before.

[「旅行」Wandering in Northwest China 漫游大西北 (Chapter 3)](https://steemit.com/steempress/@mrspointm/wanderinginnorthwestchinachapter3-94auoo245l)

The next morning, the driver drove us to the famous scenic spot Mingsha Mountain. But as for me, I had to find a hotel to take a rest. After all, having experienced the desert camping, I didn't have time to wash.

The weather in Dunhuang is particularly dry, and when standing in the the sun you may feel so hot. Instead, in the shade, it's cool. I like such kind of summer. 

After having breakfast and getting prepared, it's time to go to the next tourist attraction.

In fact, we'd planned to visit the Mogao Caves, but all tickets were sold out. Finally, we chose Mingsha Mountain as our destination. I hadn't expected it to be so beautiful and it was definitely worth a visit.

Walking through the service zone for tourists, I noticed that the desert met the sky, which seemed as if blending into one. 

The shadow of the clouds in the sky made the desert look dark and clear. The desert in the distance was just like a silky scarf.

I found it the beauty of desolation. Covering a large area, it makes you convinced that walking through this whole desert was quite difficult. 

Generally speaking, most people would like to take a sightseeing car or ride a camel.

**Camel riding is still very worthwhile to experience. Despite the high price, you can fully enjoy the riding time.** The local guide will take the camel team slowly to the top of the mountain and then go down. Pay attention to being prepared for the burning sun ahead of time.

整整一夜，我能感觉到大风吹动帐篷，能透过帐篷顶观察到朦胧的月色，几乎从来没有和大自然这样亲密地接触，这次的沙漠露营体验真是超值。第二天，一大早司机师傅就载着我们去景点鸣沙山附近，先找一家旅店休整一番，毕竟体验过沙漠露营后都没怎么好好洗漱。

敦煌的天气果然特别干燥，晒着太阳感觉火辣辣的，可一到阴凉处就感觉没那么热，挺喜欢这样的夏天。吃过早饭，做好了准备工作，终于可以奔向下一个景点了。

虽然鸣沙山是我们由于没买到莫高窟的门票退而求其次的选择，然而没想到它是这么漂亮，这里绝对值得一去。走过游客服务区，我的眼前是与天相接的沙漠，天上云朵的影子使沙漠看起来阴暗分明，远处的沙漠就像是柔滑丝巾。

这是一种荒芜的美。这里很大，大到会让你感觉步行通过这片沙漠是一件无比艰难的事，事实上大多数人都会选择坐游览车或骑骆驼。

**骑骆驼还是非常值得体验的，虽然价格贵了点，但骑行的时间还是比较长**。领队会带着骆驼队伍缓缓走上山顶再走下来，不过一定要做好防晒准备。

未完待续 ...
