In my eyes, what matters a lot  for me when travelling is food and shelter. If you don't sleep well or your stomach can not be satisfied, you will lose the meaning of travel. Having spent much time on it, I have already picked out some restaurants of high quality. Today, I’d like to take you to visit a most popular one named No. 6 Restaurant in Phuket.

>在我眼里，外出旅行什么体验感都不是最重要的，我最在乎的不外乎两件事，吃与住。睡不好，景色再美也会显得黯淡失色，又或连自己的胃都无法满足，那就几乎失去了旅行的意义了。所以在吃这一方面的攻略我耗费的精力最多，我选出了一些必吃的店，今天就由我带大家看看普吉岛六号餐厅的庐山真面目。

The No. 6 Restaurant we visited is located near Jungceylon, and as can be seen from the photo above, it 's only two minutes away.
>我们造访的六号餐厅位于江西冷附近，背朝江西冷往右走两分钟就可以看见这家餐厅。

Although it was raining that day, there were still people waiting in line, most of whom were Chinese tourists. For its good business, this restaurant is different from the ordinary ones, where the dining table is like the table in the school cafeteria. We sat close to strangers.
>虽然是雨天，但这里依然有排队的人，且大部分都是中国游客。由于生意太好，这家餐厅与普通餐厅不同的是，餐桌像是学校食堂的桌子，我们紧挨着陌生人，即便是这样还是排起了队。

**Let's take a look at what we've ordered 一起来看看我们点了什么**

**<li>Shrimps fritters 炸虾球</li>**

I like eating shrimps, so the first dish I ordered is shrimps fritters. In fact, the taste of fried food is almost the same, but what makes this dish special is the dipping sauce. Inside it is some pod pepper, but  it's actually not so spicy. Instead it is sweet and spicy, especially suitable for kids.
>我喜欢吃虾，所以我点的第一道菜就是炸虾球。其实油炸出来的味道在哪里都差不多，这道菜最大的亮点就在于蘸料。别看碟子里加了小米辣，可实际上没那么辣，贴切地说是甜辣味，特别适合小朋友。

**<li>Tom yum soup 冬阴功汤</li>**

I have heard of Tom Yum Kung soup before, which is a classic dish in Thai food. It is definitely in my list! Frankly speaking, although I have no interest in the vegetables in the soup, yet I like this soup. Tt's hard to describe the taste. The more you drink, the more delicious you can feel the soup.
>很久以前就听说过冬阴功汤，这算是泰国菜中的经典佳肴，绝对处于我的必吃列表里！客观地评价，虽然我对汤里的菜毫无兴趣，但我很喜欢喝汤，很难去描述这道汤，越是细细品尝越能感受到汤的滋味。

**<li>Barbecue pork neck 碳烤猪颈肉</li>**
 @mrpointp said that this is his favorite dish in Thailand because of its simon-pure barbecue flavor. The only drawback is that there is no spicy taste in the dipping sauce.
> @mrpointp说这是他来泰国最喜欢吃的菜，因为其碳烤味比较地道，唯一的欠缺就是蘸料没什么辣味。

**<li>Pineapple rice 菠萝饭</li>**

Pineapple rice is made of shrimps, cashew nuts, red pepper, pineapple, rice and other ingredients. I personally think that this meal is traditional Thai flavor, in which shrimps taste fresh. I highly recommend that you taste it when visiting Thailand.
>菠萝饭是由虾、腰果、红椒、菠萝、米饭等食材烹饪而成，个人觉得这份饭是很地道的泰国风味，尤其是虾很新鲜，推荐大家来泰国一定要尝尝菠萝饭。

**<li>Mango with sticky rice 芒果糯米饭</li>**

This dish is very sweet but nor greasy. Use the fork to make glutinous rice and mango together, and dip them in coconut juice, you will feel refreshed. 
>这道菜甜而不腻，用餐叉将糯米饭和芒果叉在一起，蘸少许椰子汁，口感清爽，甜而不腻，回味无穷。

**<li>Fried noodles with seafood 海鲜炒面</li>**

When I came here, I knew that noodles is also an important part of Thai food, among which fried noodles with seafood is the most popular. The fried noodles usually include salmon, shrimp, egg and vegetables. I personally think this dish is worth tasting.
>来了普吉岛才知道，面食也是泰国食物的重要组成部分，海鲜炒面最为流行。通常的炒面中有鱿鱼、虾、鸡蛋以及蔬菜，个人觉得这道菜还是很值得品尝的。

There are several so-called No. 6 restaurants on the island, but in order to prevent being cheated, you need to remember the sign of  the real No. 6 restaurant, as is shown in the picture.  
>岛上有数家六号餐厅，但真正的六号餐厅如图所示，所以想去六号餐厅也一定要看清楚招牌和菜单，以防被坑。

Perhaps many people think Thai food particularly unpalatable. Actually, such statement is somewhat subjective. After all, it is difficult to cater for all tastes. Fortunately, I found some food that completely suited my taste, making the whole journey more exciting.
>也许很多人觉得泰国食物特别难吃，其实这样的说法多少有些主观，毕竟众口难调。所以此次普吉之行还是很幸运的，遇到了很多适合自己口味的美食，使整个旅程的精彩倍增。
