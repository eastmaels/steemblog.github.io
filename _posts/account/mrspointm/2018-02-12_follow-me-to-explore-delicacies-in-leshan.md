#### Hi, steemit friends!💙

In my childhood memory, apart from pancake introduced last time, there is also a restaurant in Leshan which is well-known in our city even in Sichuan. It is called “Jiǔ Meì Pickled Chicken Paws” that had been in operation for many years. I do not remember the first time I ate there. But when I was a kid, I heard of it.
>在我的儿时美味记忆中，除了上次介绍的蛋烘糕，还有一家餐厅在乐山也可谓是家喻户晓，那就是经营了很多年的“九妹凤爪”。我完全不记得第一次去吃九妹凤爪大概是什么时候，在印象当中是我还很小的时候就听说过这家店。

People in Sichuan like eating pickled chicken paws because its spicy taste is so special. Although the more you eat, the spicier you will feel. Actually, you can’t help eating more and more. As we know, Packaged paws has existed on the market for a long time, but it’s reported that most packaged ones cannot come to the standards of the relevant departments. Therefore, I seldom buy packaged paws. To be honest, many restaurants make pickled chicken paw, which can ever match the packaged. But the reataurant Jiǔ Meì Pickled Chicken Paws is an exception.
>四川人很喜欢吃泡椒凤爪，因为它的辣很特别，虽然越吃越辣，但又越吃越想吃。市面上早就出现了包装式的泡椒凤爪，但以前新闻上报道这种包装食品光鲜的背后其卫生标准根本经不起相关部门的检验。于是我再也不敢去买包装式的泡椒凤爪，然而许多凉菜店制成的泡椒凤爪没那么美味，可九妹凤爪是个例外。

In addition, other dishes in this restaurant are also very delicious. Most people rush here for having a taste of its special pickled chicken paws, so the other dishes are covered by the fame of paws. For example, the photo above called guaì weì potatoes that is, potatoes with a special taste, which taste a little bit spicy, a little sweet and a little bit of vinegar. I guess this is the origin of its name . Perhaps the name of this dish does not sound appetizing, but it will not let you down!
>除了泡椒凤爪，九妹凤爪餐厅里其他的小吃也非常美味，只是因为大多数人都奔着凤爪去的，所以那些美食被凤爪的名气所掩盖。就比如图片上的怪味土豆，其主要味道还是辣，但并不是纯粹的令人“呼哧呼哧”的辣，有一点点甜味，有一点点醋味，我猜这就是它名字的由来吧。也许怪味土豆听起来不会使人充满食欲，但绝对不会让你失望！

Braised chicken paws and wings are delicious as well as some spicy cold dishes. The original place where this restaurant was located has been destroyed by a sudden fire at night because of the aging circuit. Fortunately, there were no injured people. Soon a brand new restaurant has reopened.
>卤鸡爪鸡翅同样美味，还有一些偏辣的凉菜。九妹凤爪原来的店铺由于电路老化被夜间突如其来的一场大火烧毁，所幸是财伤人未伤。很快新的九妹凤爪重新开始营业了。

Small dumplings taste great, which I like best.
>我最喜欢的还是简简单单的醪糟汤圆。

If you visit Leshan and long for delicious food, feel free to look through my article, which is totally considered as free guide. (I am considering whether to charge those restaurants for advertising fees, lol..)
>如果各位朋友来乐山吃美食就可以翻看我的文章，简直是免费攻略。（我在考虑要不要向那些美食店铺收取广告费，哈哈）
