At 2:31 pm on July 30th, 2017(Beijing time),  a mysterious account in this social platform---steemit was created. ... <del>Well, I can not make it up any more.</del>My account came into effect at that moment.
<blockquote>2017年7月30日，北京时间凌晨2点31分，一个神秘的账号在steemit社交平台诞生了......<del>好吧我编不下去了</del>，我的账号就是在那一刻生效的。</blockquote>

Is it time to say something? Well, I have to say that I want to thank so many people.  First of all, thank my parents and teachers,  they succeeded in raising me up with the correct "three values" so that I can interact with everyone on the Internet. And then I really really thank my friends, whether you are whales or minnows. Whoever we can chat with are friends! Some of them have also written such post and like @..., but there are so many, so I just hope you can understand.
<blockquote>现在是不是该感谢了？好的，不得不说我有一大堆人要感谢，首先要感谢父母老师，是他们成功地把我养育成人，有了正确的三观，才能在屏幕这边跟大家互动交流。然后我真的真的真心感谢一直支持我的朋友，不论是大鱼还是小鱼，聊得来的都是朋友！他们写感谢帖都喜欢@，我就不@了，希望朋友们对号入座，心照不宣！</blockquote>

Actually, I have known steemit not just for 14 days.  It has dated back to the day since my boyfriend's account was created. Before I wrote posts, he had told me, "Since you want to share something on this platform, you don't have to care about how much you have gained from your articles. If you care too much, you will feel tired."
<blockquote>其实我不仅仅接触steemit 14天，从男朋友的账号 @mrpointp诞生于此的时候，我就开始了解它。在我的账号创立之前，男朋友就告诉我：既然你要玩steemit，那就不要在意这帖那帖得了多少钱，如果你过于在意就会很累。</blockquote>

Looking back at his home page, most of his posts gained only $0.5 or $1 during the first two weeks and now he has made more progress than before.  But I find he is always writing posts with interest and serious about each article. Every time, he finishes, he is rarely concerned about  its proceed, but I am more than excited and refresh the website every now and then. I do not exaggerate the words and do not want to  boast that he is a person who is not pleased by external gains and not saddened by personal losses deliberately. As a steemit player, you need to have such a mentality, or you will lose much more than you get.
<blockquote>其实回头看看他的账号主页，刚开始的两周大多数帖子都是一两块，现在也只是比以前有了一些起色，但我还是看他每天兴致勃勃地写小说、写游玩，每一篇都很用心。男朋友发完帖子后，很少看收益，而我却比他还兴奋过一会就看看他的帖。我没有夸大其词，更不是想刻意夸扬他是个不以物喜不以己悲的人，但作为一个steemit玩家，必须具备这样的心态，否则你收获的会比你失去的更多。</blockquote>

Now, I am writing only one series---<i><b>Write a Poem for You---My handwritten copy of the poem</b></i>, like <a href="https://steemit.com/life/@mrspointm/write-a-poem-for-you-my-handwritten-copy-of-the-poem-9-saying-good-bye-to-cambridge-again-9">Write a Poem for You---My handwritten copy of the poem #9: Saying Good-bye to Cambridge Again</a>. The original idea of it is to regain the habit of handwriting. Nowadays,  most of us are accustomed to using a computer or mobile phone instead of handwriting. Meanwhile, to have a different understanding of the classic poetry is my purpose. At present, it is has been accpeted.
 In addition, I share some moments happened in my life, like  <a href="https://steemit.com/cn/@mrspointm/an-unmissable-dine-and-dash">An Unmissable Dine and Dash</a>.
<blockquote>我目前只写了一个系列：为你写诗---我的手抄诗歌，如
<a href="https://steemit.com/life/@mrspointm/write-a-poem-for-you-my-handwritten-copy-of-the-poem-9-saying-good-bye-to-cambridge-again-9">  为你写诗--我的手抄诗歌#9：再别康桥</a> ，这个系列的初衷是希望自己回归到手写，现在大多数都习惯用电脑或手机代替写字。同时，用重读经典诗歌的方式来作出不一样的理解。目前看来，大家还比较接受这一系列。
此外，我也偶尔分享一些生活的点滴，如：<a href="https://steemit.com/cn/@mrspointm/an-unmissable-dine-and-dash">一顿不可错过的霸王餐</a>。</blockquote>
