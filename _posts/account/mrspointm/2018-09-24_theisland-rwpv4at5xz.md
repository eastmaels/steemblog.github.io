<strong>Hi, steemit friends!💙</strong>

Since the new semester began, I've been busy with my work. Seldom do I have time to see films in the cinema. It was not until the video platform iQiyi uploaded <b>_The Island_</b> that I had a chance to enjoy it.

Compared with other similar films or TV plays, this is a less bloody film on how to survive on a deserted island. The most terrible part of the whole play is the mass brawl. During the hundreds of days of fighting survival on this island, no one died because of the struggle for interests. It shows this scale is well grasped. At this scale, <b>_The Island_</b> can still stimulate my reflection.

A group of people in different positions work in the same company. One day, a huge wave brought them to an uninhabited island, where all of their positions would be cleared. Thus, the nature of human being was exposed at this time. The film is well mastered in character characterization. People in different positions all exposed their selfish humanities at different moments.

For example, the security guard Zhao Tianlong was originally honest,  and even didn't know what the word "league building" meant, but he was the first person to break out. People who would flatter the leader also revealed their characters.

I have to say that the starring Huang Bo is the highlight of the whole play. The hero Ma Jin(played by Huang Bo) knew that he had won a 60-million-prize in a lottery on the first day of this desert island, and that he was required to cash the winning lottery ticket in 90 days made him crazy.

Compared with his life, to own 60 million counted more. Approaching the deadline, Ma Jin almost broke down and cried. Dramatically, at this time, a heavy rain brought countless marine fish to Ma Jin and Xiao Xing (played by Zhang Yixing). Ma Jin said to himself, "This is absolutely a reward for me."

On this deserted island, whoever owns food is the King. What this film expresses most is the reality and horrible humanity. Most of the 30 people on this island were mediocre. In times of distress, there was only one thing in their mind—to live on.

Without morality and bottom line, if anyone was egged on, they would do whatever they were asked to do. At that moment, I realized that most people in this world are like this, perhaps including you and me, because we are used to disguising ourselves in such a materially rich world.

The so-called honest Xiao Xing also became a bad guy. Because of his power—the ability to control others, he began to become so crazy that later on he destroyed others’ hope of returning home for the sake of his own interests. Someone thinks that Xiao Xing is actually the gloomy side of Ma Jin, but I think this is everyone's gloomy side. Ma Jin’s kindness was more than desire. The ending of the film is almost perfect. Thirty people have returned to their homes, safe and sound. I believe this ending totally caters to the expectations of most audiences.

However, from the perspective of the authenticity of the film, there still exist some flaws in it. It reminds me of the movie named <b>_Cast Away_</b> starring Tom Hanks in 2000, which does better in dealing with details. On this abandoned  island, it is hard to find food.

The chronically underfed won't be gentle and friendly. The most important thing is that in that case there must be some people who get sick. Another American play , <b>_Lost_</b>,  tells of dozens of people struggling to live on a small island. The details are also handled very well. Of course, TV plays and movies are incomparable.

To be frank, <b>_The Island_</b> is a wonderful domestic movie that I have seen in recent years, for its success doesn't lie in nostalgia. If you have an interest, you may as well see this film.

新学期一开始，我便投入繁忙的工作中，一直没有抽空去影院看这出戏。直到《一出好戏》在爱奇艺上线，我才有机会一睹电影风采。

相比其他类似影视剧，这是一部很温柔的荒岛求生类型电影，全程最激烈的就是群殴。在岛上数百天的求生时光里没有人因为利益斗争而死亡，这个尺度把握得还是比较好的。就在这样的尺度下，《一出好戏》依然能引发我内心的思考。

一群同在一个公司的人，不同的职位和阶级，一个巨浪将他们带到一个无人岛，在这里，一切的职位和阶级都将清零。于是，每个人的本性就暴露出来。这部电影在人物性格刻画上掌握得很好，根据不同阶级的人物设置暴露人性的时间。比如，保安赵天龙原本憨厚老实，连“团建”一词都不知道什么意思，可他偏偏是最先爆发的人。而公司里平日里最爱巴结领导的人在这时也暴露出墙头草的性格，谁能让他活下来就做谁的跟屁虫。

不得不说主演黄渤的演技算是这部戏的顶梁柱，男主角马进在入岛那一天中了六千万的大奖，而九十天的兑奖倒计时让他陷入疯狂，他将六千万看得比命还重要。就在兑奖日到期的那一天，马进几乎是崩溃了，戏剧性的是，在就此时，无数条海鱼随着一场大雨砸向了马进和小兴（张艺兴饰演）。马进说：“这是老天爷把奖给我兑了。”

在这座荒岛上，有食物就有权，就是王。几乎整部电影都在表达一个内容，那就是人性的现实与可怕。在这岛上的三十人中，大部分都是平庸者，危难的时刻脑子里只有生存这两个字，没有道德、没有底线，但凡有人怂恿，这些人什么事都能做出来。看到这里，我意识到，在这个世界上其实大多数人都是这样，或许包括你和我，因为我们都习惯了在这个物资丰富的世界里伪装自己。

原本憨厚老实的小兴黑化了，因为有了权，有了控制别人的能力，他开始变得疯狂，以至于后来为了利益狠心抹杀别人回家的希望。有人说，小兴其实是马进的黑暗面，但我认为这是每一个人的黑暗面，只是马进的善良胜过欲望。这部电影的结局几乎是完美的，三十个人完完整整地回了家，我相信这个结局更迎合大多数观众的期望。

但从电影的真实性角度出发，《一出好戏》还是有很多槽点的。它令我想起2000年汤姆·汉克斯主演的电影《荒岛余生》，这部电影在很多细节上是完胜前者的。在一座荒岛上，找到食物绝不会那么容易，长时间处于饥饿状态下的人也一定不会那么温和友好，最重要的是，在那种情况下一定会有人生病。另一部美剧《迷失》，同样是几十人在一座小岛上求生，细节上处理得很好，当然电视剧和电影是无法比较的。

《一出好戏》是近几年我看过的国产电影中不靠情怀却拍得相当精彩的一部电影，感兴趣的朋友不妨去看看这部电影。 <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : http://mrspointm.vornix.blog/2018/09/24/%e3%80%8c%e5%bd%b1%e8%af%84%e3%80%8d%e4%b8%80%e5%87%ba%e5%a5%bd%e6%88%8f-the-island-%e6%9a%b4%e9%9c%b2%e4%bd%a0%e7%9a%84%e4%ba%ba%e6%80%a7/ </em><hr/></center>
