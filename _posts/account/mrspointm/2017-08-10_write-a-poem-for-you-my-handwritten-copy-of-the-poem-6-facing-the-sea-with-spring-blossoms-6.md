Don't compare your life to others, you have no idea what their journey is all about. No one is in charge of your happiness except you.
<blockquote>不要拿自己的生活跟比人比，因为你无法了解别人的经历。没人能主宰你的幸福，除了你自己。</blockquote>

#### Dear steemit friends, 

I want to share with you a poem called <i>Facing the Sea with Spring Blossoms</i>, written by Hai Zi. The original text is as follows:
今天想要和大家分享的一首诗，叫《面朝大海，春暖花开》，作者海子。原文如下：

<b>面朝大海，春暖花开</b>
从明天起，做一个幸福的人
喂马、劈柴，周游世界
从明天起，关心粮食和蔬菜
我有一所房子，面朝大海，春暖花开
从明天起，和每一个亲人通信
告诉他们我的幸福
那幸福的闪电告诉我的
我将告诉每一个人
给每一条河每一座山取一个温暖的名字
陌生人，我也为你祝福
愿你有一个灿烂的前程
愿你有情人终成眷属
愿你在尘世获得幸福
我只愿面朝大海，春暖花开
****
Translation version 译文

<b>Facing the Sea with Spring Blossoms</b>
From tomorrow on
I will be a happy man
Grooming, chopping
and traveling all over the world
From tomorrow on
I will care foodstuff and vegetable
I have a house towards the sea
with spring blossoming
From tomorrow on
write to each of my dear ones
Telling them of my happiness
What the lightening of happiness has told me
I will spread it to each of them
Give a warm name for every river and every mountain
Strangers, I will also give you my well-wishing
May you have a brilliant future
May your lovers eventually become spouse
May you enjoy happiness in this earthly world
I only wish to face the sea, with spring flowers blossoming
****

I have read this poem several years before. My first impression of it is  warm and serene, especially the last sentence " I only wish to face the sea, with spring flowers blossoming" is popular among us. We often hear someone quote it. The author Hai Zi's mood is too hard to understand. I believe that many people like me just purely love this poem. Hai Zi has used the simple words to express his feelings about freedom and real spiritual world.

<blockquote>很久以前就读过这首诗，带给我的第一印象就是温暖安详，尤其是最后一句“面朝大海，春暖花开”更是成为脍炙人口的佳句，常常会听见有人引用。作者海子的心境太深奥，相信有许多人和我一样只是纯粹地喜爱这首诗，诗中将海子的渴望展现地淋漓尽致，渴望回归自然和真正的精神世界。</blockquote>
