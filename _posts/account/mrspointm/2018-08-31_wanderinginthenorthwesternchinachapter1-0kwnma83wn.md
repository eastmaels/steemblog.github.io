<strong>Hi, steemit friends!💙</strong>

Long time no see! These days I've been busy travelling and now I'd like to share them one by one. It is said that Qinghai becomes a popular sightseeing place because of a video app named <em>Douyin</em>, but I feel it's worth it. I'm a southerner breathing the humid air of Sichuan and feeling the mild sunshine at low altitude. With anxiety and curiosity, we set out.

After a night, we finally transferred to Xining via Lanzhou. Cool temperatures, hot sunshine and our dark-skinned driver—everything in front of us made me realize that our travel had begun. As the driver said, the weather in Xining is the hottest of this year. At this time, I was so envious of it, because it is not as hot and humid as Sichuan. Even if there is the sun shining, you will feel cool in the shade.

_<center>Day 1 Riyue Mountain → Daotang River → Qinghai Lake</center>_

<strong>Riyue Mountain</strong>

Its rich historical legend is my first impression of Riyue Mountain. Thousands of years ago, Princess Wencheng in Tang Dynasty was sent far from home and married Srongtsen Gampo, and Riyue Mountain was the hometown she missed. It is said that the sun and moon mirror fell into two halves. It separately fell on two mountains, and Riyue Mountain was named after it.

This scenic spot is about 3,500 meters above sea level, with an average elevation of 4,000 meters. Stand at a high place, and you will have a good view, which is extremely shocking and amazing.

The Sun and Moon pavilion is an octagonal spire-style brick-wood structure with a golden glazed tile roof. The two pavilions are equipped with round and semi-circular bronze mirrors to represent the sun and the moon.

<strong>Daotang River</strong>

This river is another place full of legends. The most widely known one is that Princess Wencheng’s tears of homesickness converged this stream flowing westward. With its ethnical features and living flavour, after buying the tickets, we can wear traditional Tibetan costumes and take photos freely.

You can see many Marnyi Stone piles when you enter the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.  Inside the pile are scriptures that prevent hatred, drive away disasters, and pray for peace. The stones are often engraved with Buddha images or a common Tibetan slogan.

<strong>Qinghai Lake</strong>

Qinghai Lake is the largest saltwater lake in China. With the area of ​​more than 4,000 square kilometers, this place is destined to be an extraordinary lake. It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Qinghai. I have to say that Qinghai Lake is really beautiful and fascinating. With blue sky, the clear lake is surrounded by mountains.

This was the first time that I had visited Qinghai, and I saw the vast prairie for the first time. It not only broadened my horizon, but also shocked my soul. There were cattle and sheep horses that were stocked everywhere. They were born with the vast grasslands. Everything there was like a dynamic picture, which made me linger.

Staying here for a whole day, it seemed that I had forgotten the prosperity of the noisy city and were eager to integrate into this pure nature. At night, we put up at the B&amp;B near the shore of the Heima River, where we could watch the sunrise the next morning.  With satisfaction and expectation, we fell asleep.

好久不见，这段时间我一直旅行在路上，今天开始为大家一一分享。都说青海是被抖音的各位大神炒火的，然而我却觉得它火得名副其实。我是一个南方人，从小呼吸大四川湿润的空气、感受低海拔温和的阳光。前些日子，我们带着忐忑与好奇，向祖国的西北出发。

途经兰州，终于在一夜之后我们踏上了青海西宁的土地，凉爽的温度，炙热的阳光以及黝黑的司机大哥，眼前的一切让我意识到，旅行将正式开始。正如司机师傅说，今天的西宁算是一年中较热的时候了，此时我内心是羡慕的，因为这里不像四川那般湿热，即便是大太阳，但凡处于阴凉处也会觉得十分凉爽。

浓郁的历史传说是我对日月山的第一印象，上千年前，大唐的文成公主远嫁此地，而日月山正是她思念故乡的地方，据说日月宝镜摔为两半正好落在两座山包上，日月山也因此得名。景点海拔3500米左右，平均海拔4000米，站在高处远眺前方，蓝天白云无边草原尽收眼底，无比震撼。日月亭为八角攒尖顶式砖木结构建筑，金黄色琉璃瓦覆顶。二亭顶尖分别装置圆形和半圆形铜镜，代表日、月。

倒淌河是另一个充满传说的地方，最广为人知的传说便是文成公主思乡念亲之泪汇成了这倒淌的河流。倒淌河景点极富民族气息，游客买了门票之后，便可换上藏族服饰四处拍照，骑着牦牛合影也是免费的。进入青藏高原就能看到许多玛尼石堆，石堆内藏有阻止秽恶、祛除灾难、祈祷祥和的经文，上面均镌刻着佛像或经文常见的是藏文的六字箴言。

青海湖是我国境内最大的咸水湖，四千多平方公里的面积注定了青海湖不是一个平凡的湖泊，它是青海最热门的旅游景点之一。不得不说，青海湖真的漂亮到令人神往，美景不过山、水、天，青海湖兼顾三者。

第一次来到青海，也是第一次看见草原，这一切不仅仅是眼睛的享受，更是心灵的震撼，四处都是放养的牛羊马，它们生来就与辽阔的草原十分般配，草原上的一切就像一副动态画卷，令我流连忘返。来了一天，似乎我已忘记城市的繁华与喧嚣，渴望融入这纯粹的自然。第一晚住在临近黑马河岸边的民宿，这当然是为观赏明早的日出创造条件，我们带着满足和期盼入睡。

最后奉上在青海湖拍的短视频，希望大家喜欢。未完待续...
