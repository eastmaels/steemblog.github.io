## Hi, steemit friends!💙

For our  students, the so-called boring life in high school really needs some embellishments, such as winter vacation and summer vacation. Generally,  these holidays are always  far out of reach and gone too soon for the students.  But if they can have a day or half  a day off, they will feel satisfied and excited. These two days, our school is holding an annual sports meeting, which I think is a time for relaxation. Now let's take a look!

### The Opening Ceremony
What impressed me most was its opening ceremony.  From the quality of the program to the design of costumes, I think it is grander and more brilliant than any other one  in previous years.

In our senior high, the first important thing in the sports meeting is the fashion parade by classes. They need to parade along the playground to show the image of their classes, with positive slogans shouting all the way. Whether the head teacher or the students in class are very concerned about the quality of their team. So two or three weeks before the sports meeting, the classes began to prepare a variety of things, including clothes and slogans. The parade is also a highlight, where students are in different costumes. From here, we can find their creative imagination.

### Team Events for Teachers
Usually, team evens for teachers are arranged first, but I rarely participate in these games, especially running.  Dribbling the ball is quite interesting, and participants need to dribble the ball for a distance of 50 meters. We won't consume much strength and it takes little time.  I find that since I worked, I have never played basketball for a long time or done other sports.

<center><sub>All the teachers in this event have tried their best to run.</sub></center>

However, senior three students only participate in the half-day sports meeting, and then go back to class. Our school has always had strict requirements for senior three. After all, it won't take a year before they take the college entrance examination, and they need to focus on that. 

The sports meeting seem less important, but in fact, it is of great help to our students.  Sports awareness is like moral education, which need to be cultivated from an early age, because it will benefit students' psychological and physical health.Life lies in movement.

致cn区的朋友们：

对学生们来说，枯燥无味的高中需要的一些点缀，比如寒暑假，不过这些大假对于学生们而言总是“遥不可及”又“转瞬即逝”。然而偶尔的小惊喜，哪怕是一天半天不上课也会让他们觉得很满足，这两天学校正在举行一年一度的运动会，转眼间这已是我在这所高中度过的第六个运动会。

这次开幕式的表演也令人眼前一亮，从节目的质量到服装的设计，我觉得这一届运动会比往年更隆重。在这所高中，运动会对于一个班级最重要的莫过于班级方队，因为这代表着一个班集体的整体形象，无论是班主任还是学生都很在意方队的质量。于是运动会之前的两三周，各班就开始着手准备各种事情，从方队服装到方队人选再到班级口号。班级方队也是运动会的一大亮点，各班的服装各异，有可爱的卡通装，也有怀旧的民国时期学生装，学生的想象力真的好丰富。

然而我们高三班级只参与半天的运动会，然后就回去上课，因为学校对毕业班一向要求严格，毕竟不到一年就要高考了，要冲刺一下。尽管只有半天时间，这些高三的学生们依然是兴致勃勃，或许是因为这将是他们最后一次高中运动会，对这个待了两年多时间的地方还是有不少感情的，他们想在这里再“嗨”一次。

按照惯例，我们学校通常会把老师的比赛项目放在前面，不过我很少参加这些比赛，其实其他老师也很少主动参加。运球往返跑就挺有意思的，比赛耗时不长，体能消耗也不大，而且赛情还激烈。我发现人一旦参加工作，长时间不打篮球或者做其他运动，动作远不及青少年时期那么灵活。

运动会这类活动看似不太重要，但其实对学生的帮助是很大的。通常一个少年喜欢上运动的最佳时期是初中到高中，到了大学通常“运动”这个爱好的排名已经不在前面了，那么一个人这辈子还有多少时间去爱上运动呢？运动意识就像品德教育一样，需要从小培养，因为这会使学生的心理和身体健康都受益匪浅。
