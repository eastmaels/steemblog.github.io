Every morning we woke up in Phuket, we always felt excited, so we decided to explore this place. We ate breakfast on the balcony of our room. At this time, several people were swimming in the pool. The sea that had receded yesterday evening drifted over the beach with the arrival of the sun. I have to say that this is a very pleasant dining environment.

After breakfast, we also changed the swimsuit to enjoy in the swimming pool. At that moment, swimming in the pool was particularly comfortable, for the sun was not so hot and the water temperature was just right. I really realized that the weather in Phuket was unpredictable.A sudden rain brought each of us in the pool back to the room. We were also ready to go to lively Patong.

#### No.6 Restaurant and Swensen's

Today our first stop is to visit the No. 6 restaurant with the highest evaluation on the Internet. This restaurant has several branches in here. It's said that the food here is of great quality. With noon approaching, there were lots of people lining up outside, most of whom were Chinese. It seemed that this restaurant had been very successful in domestic online market,lol... To be honest, this restaurant is still worth queuing for visitors. I will introduce the specific content in a few days. After lunch, of course, it's time for desserts in a famous store in Thailand named Swensen's.

#### Let's Relax Spa

There was no such thing as massage on our schedule that day, but because of the bad weather, we decided to enjoy Thai-style massage in Let's Relax Phuket 2nd Street. It took ten minutes from Jungceylon. If you pay a visit to Thailand, you do experience such kind of massage, a major feature of Thailand. Thai-style massage pays special attention to stretching, but may not be so exaggerating in film or television dramas.

#### Phuket Simon Cabaret

We got wet on the way to Phuket Simon Cabaret, so it is advised that you'd better not go for a walk in Phuket during its rainy season, unless the distance is really short. Even if you bring an umbrella, it is difficult to avoid getting wet. Even so, it is worthwhile to sit in the front row enjoying this performance, leaving me a deep impression.  It was the first time we had seen ladyboys. Personally thinking, Phuket Simon Cabaret is highly recommended. If so, booking tickets online is needed, for it includes pick-up service. If you buy the tickets on the spot, it would be much more expensive.

#### Malin Plaza

Just a few hundred meters from the Simon Cabaret there is a popular market named Malin Plaza, a place that cannot be missed for foodies. The fried yoghurt and noodles in this market are super delicious.


On my second day in Phuket, "to experience the characteristics of Thai culture and cuisine " can be used to describe it. The most favorite for me is massage, because it is so comfortable that you are likely to fall asleep. When we went back to the hotel, we planned the next day's trip, hoping Phuket could bring us more surprises. Good night.

在普吉岛醒来的每个早晨都是兴奋的，我们想对这个热闹非凡的地方进行一番探索。我们在阳台上进行早餐，这时泳池里已经有几个人在游泳了，昨日傍晚退去的海水随着太阳的到来逐渐漫过沙滩，不得不说这是一个十分惬意的进餐环境。

早餐后我们也换好泳装去泳池里享受一番，此时游泳特别舒适，阳光并不剧烈，水温也刚刚合适。我真真体会到普吉岛的天气实属变化莫测，突如其来的一场雨把泳池里的所有人都赶回了房间，我们也准备前往热闹的芭东。

**六号餐厅和 Swensen's甜品店**
今天的第一个站就是去网上呼声最高的餐厅No. 6，这家餐厅在普吉岛有几家分店，味道真的算普吉岛上数一数二的。临近中午，六号餐厅的门口早已排起了队，并且来此光临的大多数都是中国人，看来这家餐厅在国内网络营销做得很成功啊，哈哈。不过这家餐厅还是值得游客排队的，具体内容过几天我会一一道来。饭后，当然是来点甜品啊，同样是网红店，位于江西冷的Swensen's。

**Let's Relax按摩店**
这天本来没有安排按摩的，但由于天气不太好想去哪儿也不太方便，我们就步行去了Let's Realx的2号街店，从江西冷出发也就十几分钟的路程。在此我想说，去泰国一定要体验一下泰式按摩，是泰国的一大特色。泰式按摩特别注重拉伸，也许没有影视剧上表现得那么夸张。

**西蒙人妖秀**
在步行前往西蒙人妖秀秀场的路上，我们几乎被淋湿透了，所以建议雨季时去普吉岛尽量不要选择步行，除非路程真的很短，就算带了雨伞也很难避免淋湿。尽管如此，坐在前排观看人妖秀真的有种震撼感，这也是我们第一次亲眼见到人妖。十分推荐大家去泰国要看人妖秀，并且要在网上预订门票（包接送），现场买真的贵很多。

**马林夜市**
距离西蒙秀场仅仅几百米就有一个热度较高的马林夜市，这是一个不容吃货错过的地方， 马林夜市的炒酸奶和炒面超好吃。

普吉之旅的第二天，为此取个小标题，那就是“体验泰国人文美食特色”，最喜欢的部分就是按摩，因为舒服到睡着。回到酒店，我们计划着明天的行程，希望普吉岛能带给我们更多的惊喜，晚安。
