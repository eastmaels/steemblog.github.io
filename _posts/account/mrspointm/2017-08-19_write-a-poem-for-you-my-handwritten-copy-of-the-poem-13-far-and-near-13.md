#### Dear steemit friends,

I want to share with you a poem <i>Far and Near </i>, written by Gu Cheng. The original text is as follows:
今天想要和大家分享的一首诗，叫《远和近》，作者顾城。原文如下：

<b>远和近</b>
你，

一会看我，

一会看云。

我觉得，

你看我时很远，

你看云时很近。
****
<code><strong>Translation version 译文</strong></code>

<b>Far and Near</b>
You,

you look at me one moment

and at clouds the next.

I feel

when you're looking at me, you're far away,

but when you're looking at the clouds, how could we be nearer!
****
The following is  my handwritten copy of this poem.
以下是我的手抄本。

This poem is short, but the author uses such simple language to express the relationship between people, as well as the relationship between man and nature. From the sentence---<i>I feel when you're looking at me, you're far away, but when you're looking at the clouds, how could we be nearer</i>, we can see that there is a gap between different people and we are always closer to nature, which shows that the author is longing for the ideal interpersonal relationship.
<blockquote>这首诗歌虽短，但却用简单的语言表达出人与人之间的关系，以及人与自然的关系。诗中那句“你看我时很远，你看云时很近。”可以看出，作者认为人和人之间是有隔阂的，反而与自然更亲近，反映出作者对理想的人际关系的向往。</blockquote>
