#### Hi, steemit friends!💙

Life is not about how to live through the storm, but how to dance in the rain.
>生活不是如何度过暴风雨，而是如何学会在雨中起舞。

It's time to introduce a poem to you. It's also about life. Have you ever thought what can be considered as a lamp in your mind? As for me, home is the lamp in my mind. Today, I want to share with you this poem <i>We are Looking for a Lamp</i> written by Gu Cheng. 
>又到了给大家推荐诗歌的时间了。这次和开篇句照应，是关于人生的。你们有没有想过在自己的心里何为一盏灯？对我而言，家是我心里的一盏明灯。今天给大家分享的是《我们去寻找一盏灯》，作者顾城。

#### The original text   原文
****

<strong>我们去寻找一盏灯</strong>
>走了那么远
我们去寻找一盏灯

>你说
它在窗帘后面
被纯白的墙壁围绕
从黄昏迁来的野花
将变成另一种颜色

>走了那么远
我们去寻找一盏灯

>你说
它在一个小站上
注视着周围的荒草
让列车静静驰过
带走温和的记忆

>走了那么远
我们去寻找一盏灯

>你说
它就在大海旁边
像金桔那么美丽
所有喜欢它的孩子
都将在早晨长大

>走了那么远
我们去寻找一盏灯

<strong> We are Looking for a Lamp</strong>
>Having walked that far
We are looking for a lamp

>You say
It is behind the curtains
Surrounded by white walls
Wildflowers picked from the evening
Will turn into another color

>Having walked that far
We are looking for a lamp

>You say
It is on a small stop
Watching the surrounding grass
Let the train speed by quietly
Taking the sweet memory away 

>Having walked that far
We are looking for a lamp

>You say
>It is at the seaside 
Looking as beautiful as a kumquat
All the kids who like it
Will grow up in the morning

>Having walked that far 
We are looking for a lamp
****
The following is my handwritten copy for this poem.
>以下是我的手抄本。

 When I first read this poem, I was a undergraduate. I had been reading it for several times until I completely understood what the author wanted to express. I appreciate its style, like the sentence in this poem—<i>It is on a small stop,watching the surrounding grass. Let the train speed by quietly, taking the sweet memory away.</i> This makes up a picture. A kid stands on the side of the railway, watching the old green-colored train slowly pass until the train completely disappeared. What is described in the poem is nice, accompanied by a lamp, which added to its warmness. It's no wonder that this kind of poem written by Gu Cheng is full of childish and fancy atmosphere.
>《我们去寻找一盏灯》第一次看见这首诗是大学的时候，连续读了好几遍，很喜欢它的风格。“它在一个小站上，注视着周围的荒草，让列车静静驰过”，这句诗让我想到一副很天然的画面：一个小孩站在铁道边注视着老式绿皮火车缓缓经过，直到火车完全消失。诗中描述的情景都是美好的，再伴随着一盏灯，又增添了不少温暖的感觉，怪不得说诗人顾城早期的诗富有孩子般的纯幼风格、梦幻情绪。
