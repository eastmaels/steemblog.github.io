## Hunter's comment
When I first joined steemit this platform, I always wondered how other steemians *<b>could add specific logo to their photos without using photoshop</b>*. I think not all people can know photoshop well, letting alone using it well, but this app can be used by anyone. If you have an interest, here we go.

>Bazaart is an award winning photo collage app, *<b>which allows you to create masterpieces on the go, and seamlessly work with Adobe Creative Cloud</b>*.

#### <li>Add any logo you want to the photo</li>
Here are some screenshots for you. First you need to prepare a logo which will be added to your photo. <b>*ATTENTION: You must use the logo with pure background. White background is the best.*</b> Then use scissors to cut and then choose the function "erase". Finally click "auto" and you will get what you want. Besides, you can adjust the size of the logo to satisfy your need. But if you want to keep the high-definition image, you have to pay for it.

#### <li>Offer various typefaces and change the size of the photo fit for social media</li>
As you can see from the picture below, you can choose a specific typeface for you, reflecting your personal style. It also offers different sizes for social media.

You can change its level of <b>*exposure, contrast, saturation, vibrance etc.</b>*
