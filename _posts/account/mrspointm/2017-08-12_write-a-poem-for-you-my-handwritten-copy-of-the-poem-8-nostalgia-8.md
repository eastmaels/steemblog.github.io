It is better to live your own destiny imperfectly than to live an imitation of somebody else’s life with perfection.
<blockquote>不完美地走自己的命运比完美地模仿别人的生活还要好。</blockquote>

<b>乡愁</b>
小时候，
乡愁是一枚小小的邮票，
我在这头，
母亲在那头。
长大后，
乡愁是一张窄窄的船票，
我在这头，
新娘在那头。
后来啊，
乡愁是一方矮矮的坟墓，
我在外头，
母亲在里头。
而现在，
乡愁是一湾浅浅的海峡，
我在这头，
大陆在那头。
****
Translation version 译文

<b>Nostalgia</b>
When I was young,
my homesickness was a small stamp,
I was here,
my mother was there.
After growing up,
my homesickness was a narrow ticket,
I was here,
my bride was there.
Later,
my homesickness was a little tomb,
I was outside,
my mother was inside.
And now,
my homesickness is a shallow strait,
I am here,
the mainland is there.
****
The following is my handwritten copy of this poem.
以下是我的手抄本。

This poem can be called a classic one.  Its author expressed his feelings and homesickness in the order of time and space. The Time: childhood, grown up, later and now; the space: the separation of mother and child, husband and wife, mother and child part forever and the separation of the wanderer and the mainland. Meanwhile, the author materialized his homesickness with four simple images, which made the poem easy to understand. And you can find the sentences in this poem read smoothly. This poem is something like the one <i>On A Quiet Night</i> written by the ancient poet Li Bai, both of which are used to express the author's homesickeness. Now, many people use these two poems to express their nostalgia.
<blockquote>这首诗堪称经典，作者以时间和空间的顺序来抒发情感，表达乡愁。时间上：小时候，长大后，后来，现在；空间上：母子分离，夫妻分离，母子死别和游子与大陆的分离。同时，作者用四个简单的意象将乡愁具体化，让人通俗易懂，读起来也朗朗上口。这和古代诗人李白《静夜思》有异曲同工之妙，现在很多人都会借用这两首诗来表达自己的思乡之情。</blockquote>
