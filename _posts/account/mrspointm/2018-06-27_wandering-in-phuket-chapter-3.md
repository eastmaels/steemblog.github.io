The next day two rounds of rains made us got wet, directly causing mrpointp to have a fever on the 3rd day. so I think it can be considered our transitional period. He lay in bed for most of the day. After cleaning and tidying up all the clothes, I began to watch theTVB Opera named Shēn Gōng Jì. Although we did not go out, I had a sense of ease.

Transit costs are high and it also wastes enegry to travel by ourselves. So we planned to find a one-day tour on the fourth and fifth days. At noon, a Chinese tour guide took a VAN to the hotel to pick us up and began a new day.

#### Gorgeous Prom Thep Cape

It's said that there is a sunset called the sunset of Prom Thep Cape, but in our eyes, it is mysterious and full of vicissitudes. Because of the bad weather, what we saw was dark clouds, but it didn't  affect my appreciation for  it. At this time, there was a different kind of beauty. I like the strong winds and green seawater. Afterwards, we went to the Karon View Point. Since it rained, we could see nothing but frog.

#### Holy Wat Cha-Long

After the rain, this temple seemed to be quiet, which gave us a momentary sense of calmness. The ground was covered with white frangipani flowers and it perfectly matched the rain that had just fallen.

According to the Thai customs, no one can be allowed to take pictures inside the temple and we didn't dress appropriately. Therefore, we just took some photos outside. It is worth mentioning that when in Rome, do as the Romans do.

#### Crowded King Power Duty Free

The last stop of this one-day trip is King Power Duty Free. Compared to the Duty Free Shop in Sanya, this place is full of people, especially Chinese . Here our tour guide first arranged for us to have dinner. The buffet offered was fairly good. Its type and taste catered to most tourists from different countries.

 <center>*For the remaining two hours, we started shopping. I bought some specialties for my friends and family.*</center>

It has turned out that it is wise to  choose a one-day tour in Phuket. We have been to many places this day, which cost us RMB 176. If you go there on your own, it will just be equal to a taxi fare. so I suggest you choosing this plan.

第二天连续淋了两次雨，直接导致mrpointp在第三天发烧了，所以这一天纯粹是当作旅行休整度过的。他在床上躺了大半天，我在把所有的衣物清洗和整理好后开始看港剧《深宫计》，这一天虽然没有出去玩，但却反而有一种度假的安逸感。

在普吉岛自己出行不仅费用过高，并且相当耗费精力，于是我们打算第四、第五天都安排跟团一日游。中午12点，中文导游带着一辆VAN来酒店接我们，自此开始了新一天的旅程。

**别致的神仙半岛**
听很多人说，有一种日落叫神仙半岛的日落，但我们眼中的神仙半岛，是神秘的、沧桑的。这天的神仙半岛由于天气原因，我们看到的是乌云密布，但这并不影响我对它的欣赏，此时的神仙半岛有种别样的美，喜欢这里呼啸的海风和碧绿的海水。之后我们去了卡伦观景台，由于此时已经下起了雨，远处尽是雾。

**神圣的查龙寺** 
雨后的查龙寺有种特别的幽静感，令我们有种瞬间从喧闹走入平静的感觉，地面上洒落着洁白的鸡蛋花，与刚刚落下的雨水相得益彰。由于泰国风俗是进入寺内不允许拍照，而且我们当天的穿着也不是太适合，所以我们仅仅是在建筑物以外拍了些照片。值得一提的是，入乡就要随俗。

**人山人海的免税店**
此次跟团一日游的最后一站就是王权免税店，比起三亚的免税店，这里当之无愧用人山人海来形容。来到免税店，导游先是安排我们进行了晚餐，这里的自助餐还算不错，种类和味道迎合了大多数来自不同国家的游客。剩下的两个小时，我们开始了各自的购物，买了一些当地的特色产品。

事实证明，来普吉岛参加跟团一日游是非常正确的选择。这一天去了好几个地方，两人团费共176元，如果是纯粹的自由行，光是打车费都要数百元，所以我也在此建议，普吉岛自由行的朋友不妨拿出一两天的时间选择跟团一日游。
