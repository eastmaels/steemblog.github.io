<strong>Hi, steemit friends!</strong>💙

We set out from Da Qaidam in the early morning, and it was also a long journey from our next destination. The altitude we were in would drop from more than 3,000 meters to around 1,000 meters. Located in Haixi Zhou of Qinghai Province, this stop is the most gorgeous highway(zuì měi gōng lù) sweeping the online world.

<center>_Day 3 The most gorgeous highway → Oil town → 365 Desert base camp_</center>

<strong>The most gorgeous highway</strong>

Some people like beaches, some like grasslands, and others may like mountains. I also believe that you will be attracted by the vast Gobi Desert. After leaving Da Qaidam, the vegetation coverage became less and less, and flocks of sheep became fewer and fewer. We drove from the grassland to the gobi, and wind turbines and base stations could be seen everywhere all the way.

At noon, we arrived and pulled our car over. This straight road is really suitable for taking photos. It is a beautiful and clean road which seems connected to the sky. I preferred the gobi on both sides of the road, barren but full of mystery. I also admired those who insisted on working here. Perhaps they could really understand the unique beauty of this Gobi Desert.

<strong>Oil town</strong>

On this vast Gobi Desert, there was an oil town located in Akesai, Gansu Province. I personally think that this is the tourist attraction with lowest cost, for the buildings in the whole town are in ruins, making this place become a film shooting base, such as <em>Chronicles of the Ghostly Tribe, Dragon Blade</em>. Even its maintenance cost can be saved. Maybe what is needed is such desolateness.

In order to make visitors feel it's worth it, there are several jeep cars and some large weapon models placed inside this oil town. What impressed me most was the bus that was at 45-degree angle to the ground.

<strong>365 Desert base camp</strong>

The following was a few hours' drive and we went directly to Dunhuang, Gansu Province. The temperature in Gansu was obviously higher than that in Qinghai, but it was quite comfortable compared with the high temperature in Sichuan. Finally, we came to a desert camping site and would experience the charm of desert tonight.

I didn’t know which type of tourists I was, but I had thought sand skiing and motorcycling wasn’t suitable for me. To my surprise, I did like sand skiing, which was a bit terrible but absolutely exciting. This was the first time I had come here. The warm and soft sand was really comfortable to step on, but it was very difficult to walk.

The coming night was destined to be the highlight of our day. We could not only enjoy the hot pot, but also could watch the show specially designed for visitors. The performance here was very interesting, which included not just singing and dancing. The host’s hard work contributed to a lively atmosphere. And then some visitors were invited to perform on the stage, which made me delighted and impressed.

I imagined what it feels like to camp in the desert. Will there be animals? Will it be a strong wind? It proved I was wrong. That night we built our separate tent in an appointed place and living in it was safer and more comfortable than I had thought. Exhausted, we fell asleep.

清晨从大柴旦镇上出发，离下一目的地将是漫长的路程，这一天我们所处的海拔也将从三千多米下降到一千多米。下一目的地位于青海省海西蒙古藏族自治州，同样也是被红遍网络的网红景点，最美公路。

有人喜欢海滨，有人喜欢草原，也有人喜欢崇山峻岭，我也相信大家也会为苍茫的戈壁滩所吸引。从大柴旦出发，植被覆盖率越来越小，羊群也越来越少，我们从草原走到戈壁滩，一路都能看见风力发电机和孤零零的基站。

中午，我们到达最美公路，把车停在了路边。这里真的非常漂亮，那是一种干净整洁的漂亮，笔直的公路和清晰的线条与天相接，没有尽头。我更喜欢道路两旁一望无垠的大戈壁，寸草不生却又充满神秘感，我也因此对那些坚持在这里默默工作与奉献的人们心生敬佩，或许他们才能真正读懂这戈壁滩的美。

在这广阔的戈壁滩上，有一个石油小镇，位于甘肃阿克塞。个人觉得这是一个成本最低的景点，整个小镇的建筑物破烂不堪，而正是因为如此它成为电影拍摄基地，比如《九层妖塔》《天将雄狮》，就连维护费都能省下，要的就是这种荒凉破旧的感觉。为了让游客感到物有所值，街道边还专门放置了几辆吉普车以及一些大型武器模型，最引人注目的是一辆与地面约呈45度的大巴车。

接下来又是数小时的车程，直奔甘肃敦煌。甘肃的气温明显比青海高，但比起四川的高温这里还算很舒适的了。最后我们到达沙漠边的一家露营基地，今晚将体验沙漠的魅力。我也不清楚我是哪种类型的游客，但我想滑沙和沙漠摩托一定不适合我，可没想到我还挺喜欢滑沙，没有想象中可怕但也绝对刺激。这是我第一次来到沙漠，温热柔和的沙子踩起来很舒服，但走起路来又很吃力。

晚上是重头戏，不仅能享用火锅，还能观看表演。这里的表演很有意思，不仅仅是简单的唱歌跳舞，主持人努力带动着气氛，并且成功地将全场的氛围带到最嗨，紧接着便邀请观众上台表演，真是开心有难忘。

我想象过沙漠露营是什么感觉，会不会有动物？会不会起大风？事实证明我想太多，那一晚我们都集中在一个范围搭建帐篷，比我想象中安全舒适。带着疲惫，我们很快入睡。
