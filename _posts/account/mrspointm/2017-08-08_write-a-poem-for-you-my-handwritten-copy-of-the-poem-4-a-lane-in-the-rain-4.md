<b>雨巷</b>
撑着油纸伞，独自
彷徨在悠长，悠长
又寂寥的雨巷，
我希望逢着
一个丁香一样的
结着愁怨的姑娘。
她是有
丁香一样的颜色，
丁香一样的芬芳，
丁香一样的忧愁，
在雨中哀怨，
哀怨又彷徨；
她彷徨在这寂寥的雨巷，
撑着油纸伞
像我一样，
像我一样地
默默彳亍着，
冷漠，凄清，又惆怅。
她静默地走近
走近，又投出
太息一般的眼光，
她飘过
像梦一般的，
像梦一般的凄婉迷茫。
像梦中飘过
一枝丁香的，
我身旁飘过这女郎；
她静默地远了，远了
到了颓圮的篱墙，
走尽这雨巷。
在雨的哀曲里，
消了她的颜色，
散了她的芬芳
消散了，甚至她的
太息般的眼光，
丁香般的惆怅。
撑着油纸伞，独自
彷徨在悠长，悠长
又寂寥的雨巷，
我希望飘过
一个丁香一样的
结着愁怨的姑娘。

Translation version 译文

 <b>A Lane in the Rain</b>
Alone holding an oil-paper umbrella,
I wander along a long
Solitary lane in the rain,
Hoping to encounter
A girl like a bouquet of lilacs
Gnawed by anxiety and resentment.
A girl
The colour of lilacs,
The fragrance of lilacs,
With the worries of lilacs,
Feeling melancholy in the rain,
Plaintive and hesitating.
She wanders along the solitary lane in the rain,
Holding an oil-paper umbrella
Just as I do,
Just like me,
Walking slowly in silence,
Aloof, sad and melancholy.
Silently she comes closer,
Closer, giving me
A glance like a sigh;
Then she floats past
Like a dream,
Dreary and blank like a dream.
Like a lilac
Floating past in a dream,
the girl floats past me;
Silently she goes further and further,
To the crumbling wall,
Out of the lane in the rain.
In the mournful melody of the rain,
Her colour has faded,
Her fragrance has disappeared,
Vanished into the void;
Even her glance like a sigh,
Melancholy like lilacs.
Alone holding an oil-paper umbrella,
I wander along a long
Solitary lane in the rain,
Hoping to pass
A girl like a bouquet of lilacs
Gnawed by anxiety and resentment.
The Alley in the Rain
Holding an umbrella, I'm alone
Wandering about the long, long,
Lonely alley in the rain,
Hoping to encounter
A girl who bears her melancholy
Like a lilac flower.
She has
The color of a lilac,
The fragrance of a lilac,
And the melancholy of a lilac.
She looks sorrowful in the rain,
Sorrowful and depressed.
She paces the lonely alley,
Holding an umbrella,
Like me,
Just like me—
Walking quietly and slowly
In coldness, solitude and melancholy.
Quietly she comes close,
Close to me and casts
A glance, like a sigh.
She drifts away
Like a dream—
So dreary and deep.
Like a lilac flower drifting by
In a dream,
The girl passes by me;
Quietly she is walking away and away,
To a broken hedge,
To the end of the alley in the rain.
In the plaintive tune of the rain
Her color fades,
Her fragrance disappears,
So do her sighing glance
And lilac-like melancholy.
Holding an umbrella, I'm alone
Wandering about the long, long,
Lonely alley in the rain,
Hoping to see passing by
A girl who bears her melancholy
Like a lilac flower.

The following is part of my handwritten copy of this poem.
以下是我的手抄本（节选）。

<i>A Lane in the Rain</i> is a lyric poem with profound symbolic meanings. In the poem, the poet has compared the dark society to the solitary lane. The words in this poem---<i>a girl like a bouquet of lilacs</i> symbolizes the poet himself, are also full of sorrow. This poem has been learnt in my previous textbook, but at that time, I did not read it completely and just thought it very elegant . Later, I  learned about the author and the background of the times, only to know that this poem even conveys so many emotions.
<blockquote>《雨巷》是一首富有浓重象征色彩的抒情诗。在诗中，诗人将当时黑暗的社会比喻为寂寥的“雨巷”，诗中那丁香一样的姑娘象征着诗人自己，同样都充满了愁苦之情。以前课本上就有这首诗，当时并没有读懂《雨巷》，只觉得这是一首很优雅的诗。后来了解了作者及时代背景，才知道这首诗竟然蕴藏了诗人如此多的情感。</blockquote>
