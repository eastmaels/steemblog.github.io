#### Hi,steemit friends！😉

 This afternoon I had half a day off, so I went for a massage with @lymichale. These Days, I have been busy with my work and am always sedentary in office, which leads to cervical vertebrae pain. Besides, I have got tired of working out. That's why I went here today.

<blockquote>今天下午休息，跟闺蜜 @lymichale相约一起去按摩。平时上班久坐，颈椎什么的全身都痛。再加上这段时间疲于锻炼，只好去按摩一下缓解缓解。😭</blockquote>

It's named Balala Bath Center which has been operating for more than a decade. Since I worked here, I have already heard of it. Apart from this time, I had been there for several times with my colleagues. After entering the hall, you will be given a cordial reception, and someone will be responsible for exchanging your shoes for slippers. Then you will take the number. When we got there, it was 1:30 p. m. There were fewer people. 

<blockquote>这家叫芭拉拉的洗浴中心应该经营了有十几年，从我在这个城市工作开始，就早已听说过，之前和同事来过几次。进入大厅之后，会有人接待，有人负责换鞋，以及拿号。今天去的时候很比较少，是下午一点半。</blockquote>

This is our number. It's lucky that we didn't take No. 250. 😂（250 means that you are silly, just kidding!)
<blockquote>这是我们拿到的号牌，幸好不是250😂</blockquote>

After getting the 3rd floor, there are a row of recording studios and fun catch machines.
<blockquote>进去到三楼的大厅，是一排排录歌和抓娃娃机的地方。</blockquote>

It's a place for relaxation. 😊
<blockquote>旁边是供休息的地方。</blockquote>

On the table are some fresh fruits. It's free!
<blockquote>桌上提供了免费的新鲜水果。</blockquote>

As we reached the room, pajamas had already been prepared for us. Technicians got ready and the waiter sent us water and fruits. Now, it's time for rest.

<blockquote>之后进入到房间，床上已准备好了睡衣。技师开始做好准备工作，服务生也准时送来了水和水果。我们就等着好好休息一下了。😊</blockquote>

Start！！
<blockquote>开始啦！</blockquote>

After two hours，we checked out. Nowadays, it's very convenient to pay by Wechat or Alipay. When it comes to this, something happened. 
<blockquote>两个小时后，去付款。现在到处都是微信支付宝付款，挺方便的。说起这个结账，还有一个小插曲。</blockquote>

Before doing a massage, we both agreed to the price. But when checking out, we need to pay another 40 yuan. Finally, we quarreled with the waitress. She thought that we should be responsible for that. After figuring out the whole process, we know it was technicians that made the mistake. Still, it didn't affect my mood for hot  pot. Later, I will share the hot pot dinner with you. 
And there is a show for Bianlian, which is magic and unique in Sichuan.

 <blockquote>我们之前就问好了价格，结果付款的时候多了40。最后，还跟服务员起了争执，她一口咬定是我们的问题，最后弄清楚之后才知道是技师弄错了，不过并没有影响晚上去吃火锅的心情：）过几天给大家分享我吃的火锅，还有变脸师傅的表演哟！😉</blockquote>
