So far, we have already been staying on this island for five days. It seems that the places we want to experience have been visited. It is said that Phuket is actually a place suitable for holidays, so we changed our plan and prepared to enjoy the beaches and hotel for the following two days. 
>我们已经在这个岛上游玩了五天，貌似我们想去体验的地方都去过了，据说普吉岛其实是个适合度假的地方，所以接下来的两头我们改变计划，好好享受普吉岛的酒店和海滩，岂不美哉？

We woke up naturally,dragging our lazy bodies to have breakfast. Back to the room, we got changed and went out for a swim, which I thought was really relaxing. Of course, while we wouldn’t go to the sights, the food there couldn't be missed. On the sixth and seventh days, we went to two special restaurants, each of which enjoyed a good reputation. One in Phuket Town, the other was located near Kata Beach. As for food, I will share it in later posts.
>一觉睡到自然醒，再拖着懒洋洋的身子去吃个早餐，再来个晨泳，这才是真正的假期。当然，景点可以不去，但美食万万不得省略。第六天和第七天，分别去了两家口碑较好的餐厅，一家在普吉镇，一家在卡塔海滩附近。关于美食，在旅行主线文章完结后，我会慢慢分享给大家。

In the evening, we walked leisurely towards Kata Beach. At this time, nearby tourists would come here for its beauty. Among the seven days in Phuket, the remaining two days made me comfortable. Although we were tired a few days ago, yet we fully experienced local culture. 
>傍晚时分，我们悠闲地走向卡塔沙滩，每到这个时候附近的游客都会往这里赶，因为卡塔的海滩实在太漂亮了。在普吉岛的七天里，度过得最舒服的就是最后那两天，前几天虽然疲倦，但体验感丰富。

Next, I want to talk about my feelings, also considered as the travel experience. If you want to visit there in the future, feel free to save this article, which may be of help.
>接下来，我想写写来普吉岛的感想，也算是普吉岛的旅行经验，如果读者们未来想要去那里，不妨收藏这篇文章，或许对大家有所帮助。

**<li>Traffic 交通</li>**

Grab app is widely recommended on the Internet,and I want to admit it's really convenient but a bit expensive.  Just three or five kilometers' distance costs about 500 Baht, equivalent to about 100 Rmb. I do not know why so many users say Grab taxis are cheap... Instead, it is a good choice to call a car at the hotel, whose price is reasonable. In addition, the hotel usually offers a free shuttle bus for some popular places. The local car named tuk-tuk is also a good choice. Some say that it is not safe, but we have experienced twice, feeling good. Its advantage is more convenient and affordable.

>网上都推荐Grab打车，我想说这个软件确实方便，但个人认为价格有些贵了，随便去个三、五公里以外的地方都要500泰铢左右，相当于人民币100元左右，不知道为什么网友说Grab打车便宜...想要价格相对实惠又舒适的话，在酒店叫车是个不错的选择，另外，通常酒店会有热门地点的免费接送车。突突车也是个不错的选择，有人说不太安全，但我们坐过两三次，感觉还不错，优点是方便、实惠。

**<li>Hotel and Amusement 酒店和游玩</li>**

If you have a credit card like Visa, you are expected to book a hotel on Booking. As the photo above shows, you can book hotels through the domestic software, but it is usually more expensive. Those who enjoy lively atmosphere can choose to live near Patong with convenient traffic. If you are concerned about the quality of the beach, hotels near Kata Beach may be fit for you, most of which are close to the sea, and there are many places where you can eat and drink.
>有信用卡的话最好在Booking上订酒店，不然也可以在国内的软件上预订，不过通常会贵一点。喜欢热闹的朋友就选择在芭东附近住最佳，又方便又省了打车钱。如果比较在意海滩的质量，卡塔海滩附近的酒店挺好，通常离沙滩都很近，周围吃吃喝喝的地方也不少。

Although it is not necessary to travel with the tour group, it is a good choice to spend a day or two to participate in the one-day trip. The route offered some groups includes the King Power Duty Free and the tour guide will help you solve many things, such as buffet and shopping cards. If you go out to the sea, you’d better join a group. Its itinerary is usually reasonable and safe. The most important thing is that it doesn’t cost much and they even offer pick-up service.
>虽说没必要纯粹跟团游，但花一两天的时间参加一日游还是不错的选择，有的团行程中包含了王权免税店，导游会帮你解决很多事，比如自助餐排队、办理购物卡。出海游的话更要报团了，行程规划通常比较合理，也比较安全。最重要的是费用问题，跟团便宜，而且包接送。

**<li>Food 美食</li>**

It especially matters a lot to enjoy various delicious food. Do refer to restaurants recommended on the Internet ahead of time, otherwise, it is likely that you’ll feel disappointed at the restaurants you’ve chosen. Generally speaking, food in the restaurant which has been recommended for many times will not taste bad, but this does not mean that Thai food is suitable for everyone. 

>吃东西这一项特别重要，千万不要抱着到了普吉岛再说的心理，那样的话很可能你去体验的每个餐厅都会让你大失所望。最好的办法就是在网上找美食攻略，一般来说，推荐次数多的餐厅味道都不会差，但这也不代表泰国食物适合每个人的口味，要做好心理准备。

**<li>Shopping 购物</li>**

In addition to the King Power, there is also a shopping mall named Central Festival near Phuket Town. As we all know, medicines in Thailand are of high quality, like herbal balms. You can buy some for your family when it is convenient.
>除了王权免税店，普吉镇附近也有个购物中心（Central Festival）。想必大家都了解泰国的有些药很不错，比如青草药膏等，在方便的情况下可以买一些回国。

Our journey to Phuket was completed successfully. Although we are deeply attached to this place, we also miss our great rivers and mountains, especially the spicy food in Sichuan,lol... Take a break and look forward to the next wonderful trip!
>我们的普吉岛之旅圆满结束，虽然对这里心有眷恋，但我们也十分想念祖国的大好河山，尤其是咱们四川的香辣味。稍作休整，期待下一次的美妙旅行！
