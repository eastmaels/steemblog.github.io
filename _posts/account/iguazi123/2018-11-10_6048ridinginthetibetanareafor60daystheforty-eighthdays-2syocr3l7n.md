今天是2016年05月31日，天空还算晴朗。早上起来，我们用开水弄了点糌粑吃，就像糊糊似的。吃完早餐就开始出发，全村藏民把我们送离，还有点依依不舍，不知以后还能否有机会再去。那个小村庄远离阿里中线的砖渣路，本来阿里中线就难走，还离路这么远，想想也有点世外桃源的味道。

Today is May 31, 2016, the sky is still sunny. When we got up in the morning, we made some simmering with boiling water, just like a paste. After breakfast, We started to leave. The Tibetans in the village sent us away, and they were still reluctant to give up. I wonder if We can have a chance to meet again in the future. The small village is far away from the brick slag road in the middle line of Ali. It is difficult to walk in the middle of Ali, and it is so far away from the road. I think it is also a bit of a paradise.

一大群藏野驴

离开村庄，过一条河，然后继续向前方出发。路基太烂，已不想骑车，加上林哥担心他的外胎被扎，没有车胎可换，弄的我们心情很是沮丧。我们尽量远离主路，实在太不好走，旁边的草地都比它好。果然，出发没多久时，我们就走错了路，去到了一块保护区，被整片的小沙丘给包围着。四处根本没有人，在那个只有黄黄的、一撮一撮小草丛的荒芜之地，我们不知道方向了。幸好，之前有把地图给下载好，还能参照着去寻找方向。好不容易走出来，可能是老天看我们太辛苦，在出来的时候，让我们看了一群藏野驴策马奔腾，很是壮观。保护区里野生动物还有一些，也不知道他们是如何在这荒凉之地生存的，直到中午吃饭，藏野驴一路伴我们前行。它们偶尔跑离我们，偶尔停下来张望着我们，它们是高原的精灵，在离天最近的王国，自由地生活着，即使气候再艰苦，依旧奔腾在藏区大地上。

Leave the village, cross a river, and continue to head forward. The roadbed is too bad, We don't want to ride a bicycle, and Lin is worried that his tires are tied, there is no tire to change, and we are very depressed. We try to stay away from the main road, it is too bad to go, the grass next to it is better than it. Sure enough, not long after the departure, we went the wrong way, went to a protected area, surrounded by a small piece of sand dunes. There are no people at all, and we don’t know the direction in the ridiculous land where there is only yellow and yellow, small grass. Fortunately, We have downloaded the map before, but We can also look for directions. It’s hard to come out, maybe it’s too hard for us to see us. When we came out, let’s watch a group of Tibetan wild horses rushing, it’s spectacular. There are still some wild animals in the reserve, and we don’t know how they survived in this desolate place until the luncheon, and the Tibetan wild ass went along with us. They occasionally run away from us, occasionally stop and look at us, and life is free.

随处可见的雪山

吃完午餐，那个路更是没法，沙坑遍地，难以前行。可能是早晨吃糌粑的原因，肚子一直不舒服，走走停停，真的是悲剧到家。我们由骑行，换成一会骑行，一会推车，然后就变成了只是推车前行。今天是阿里中线的第四天，可能我们也是太累了，这一路真是遭罪过来的，有时候都想把车扔了。快到傍晚，我们找到一块地方，车子一翻，两个人坐在沙地里，瞎聊着，苦中作乐。

After eating lunch, the road is even more incompetent, and the sand pit is everywhere, and it is difficult to move forward. May be the reason for eating cockroaches in the morning, the stomach has been uncomfortable, stop and go, it is really a tragedy to get home. We are riding, changing to a ride, a cart, and then it becomes just a cart. Today is the fourth day of Ali's midline. Maybe we are too tired. This road is really sinful. Sometimes I want to throw the car away. As we approached the evening, we found a place where the car turned over and two people sat in the sand, chatting and bitter.

推车也要向前

休息完，还得出发，只是推着车前行，天都慢慢黑了下来，终于看到一个村庄——康玛村。看那边竟然有中国移动的信号站，想着今天可以在这屋子里好好睡一晚了。然而，信号站紧闭，实在找不到能进去的地方。最后只有求助于藏民，让其允许我们在他们的屋角搭帐篷。帐篷搭好，我们去讨要了点热水，他们让我们在他们的火炉边做饭吃。那敢情好，外面冷死了，在家里做我们的晚餐，那再好不过了。说是晚餐，其实就是几片腊肉、一点木耳，还有老干妈里的油，用铁饭碗在火上加热。我们把老干妈给他们尝，看还蛮喜欢，遂把老干妈送给了他们。晚上睡觉就不叙了，几只野狗一直在帐篷边徘徊，夜里也似乎下了点雪，有人家依靠总比无人区强了。一天下来，累趴了，才前行不到四十公里，明天要翻越走阿里中线依赖的最高垭口，还是先安心睡一觉吧！

After the rest, we also got the hair, just pushing the car forward, the sky slowly darkened, and finally saw a village - Kangma Village. Look at the signal station of China Mobile, thinking that you can sleep well in this room today. However, the signal station is tight and there is no place to go. In the end, We only turned to the Tibetans and allowed them to set up tents in their corners. The tents were set up, we went to ask for some hot water, they let us cook at their stove. That’s good, cold outside, and our dinner at home, that’s great. It is dinner, in fact, it is a few pieces of bacon, a little fungus, and the oil in Laoganma, which is heated on the fire with an iron rice bowl. We gave them to the old godmother, and they liked it very much, and gave them to them. Sleeping at night does not tell, a few wild dogs have been squatting at the side of the tent, and it seems that there is some snow at night, and some people rely on it to be stronger than no one.

我断后，摆拍一个
