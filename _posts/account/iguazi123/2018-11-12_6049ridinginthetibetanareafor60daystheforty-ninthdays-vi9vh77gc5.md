藏区的早晨是美丽的，我们基本都八九点钟才起来，因为时差的原因，其实时间上还好。出发的时候，望一望今天要爬的坡，还好些不习惯，毕竟整个阿里中线的海拔虽高，但起伏不大。上午沿着山路出发，我们依旧没走正路，想抄个近路。路上一路的大石头，绕晕我们了，是不是还能看到野生动物，都很快就过去了。山上的大石头感觉是冰川时代遗留下来的，很是壮观，很快我们也回归主路了。

The morning in the Tibetan area is beautiful. We got up at eight or nine o'clock. Because of the time difference, it is actually good time. After all, the altitude of the entire Ali midline is high, but the fluctuation is not big. Starting along the mountain road in the morning, we still did not take the right path and wanted to copy a shortcut. The big stones on the road stunned us, and we could see the wild animals, and they all passed quickly. The big stone on the mountain feels like the legacy of the glacier era. It is very spectacular. Soon we will return to the main road.

今日仁青休布错美景——雪山孕育湖泊

两辆车，走阿里中线

这种路，还要翻山，真的是难到我们了。那只有继续推车前进，就这样我们一路推车上了垭口。看着林哥推车上来的样子，感觉到这一路翻越垭口比318上还要累。到达垭口，我们开始享用美味的午餐，虽然没啥好吃的，但每顿还是要吃的，不然咋个继续前进。吃完我们就继续下坡，我一遍推一遍骑了一段，屁股真的受不了，一路的小石头，林大哥还是继续推车，他是在担心他的车子。

This kind of road, but also to turn the mountain, it is really difficult for us. That is only to continue to push the bicycle forward, so we have a sip on the road. Looking at the way Lin Ge strolled up, We felt that this road was more tired than the 318. When we arrived at the pass, we started to enjoy a delicious lunch. Although it was not delicious, every meal was still eaten, otherwise we continued to move forward. After we finished eating, we continued to go downhill. I pushed it over and over again. We couldn’t stand the ass. The little stone all the way, Lin Big Brother continued to stroll. He was worried about his bicycle.

奋力推车的林大哥

一下到山脚，两个湖泊映入我们眼前，左边一个是仁青休布错，右边是昂拉仁错。昂拉仁错虽然只能看到一角，但已被折服，她就是此行中最漂亮的湖泊了。前路漫漫，也无心就近去看，一去少说也有十几公里，下次要来肯定得去瞧一瞧。那就左转继续前进，沿着仁青休布错推车前行。想骑来着，骑不了，只能跟林哥一起推车，他肯定是老怪我了，鼓舞他来这折磨人的阿里中线。被逼无奈之下，好好欣赏这湖泊，确实美丽，尤其中间还有一个类似战舰似的小岛。一座座雪山／澄清的湖水／蓝色的毒药，就这样推车好好看了一整天。走完湖泊都要天黑了，找了半天预定的露营地点，无房屋／无遮挡，想起路上碰见的司机说这一带有狼，看着一路过来的羊头，两个人讨论再三，决定吃完手上仅剩的压缩饼干，推车继续前行，已做好推车整晚的准备。

At the foot of the mountain, two lakes are in front of us, one on the left is Renqing, and on the right is Onla. Although Angola is only able to see a corner, she has been convinced that she is the most beautiful lake in the trip. The road ahead is long, and We have no intention to go to see it. We have to go to the next time. Then turn left and move on, follow the Renqing Shubu staggered bicycle. I want to ride, can't ride, can only go with Lin, he must be blame me, and inspire him to come to the tormented Ali midline. Under the helplessness, it is really beautiful to appreciate the lake, especially in the middle of a small island like a warship. A snowy mountain/clarified lake/blue poison, so We watched it all day. After walking through the lake, it was dark. We found a camping site for half a day. There was no house/no cover. We remembered the driver who met on the road and said that there was a wolf. We looked at the sheep head that came all the way. The two men discussed it again and again and decided to finish it. The only compressed biscuits left on the hand, the bicycle continues to move forward, and the bicycle is ready for the whole night.

昂拉仁错一角

海枯石烂

似战舰直达湖中

找个空地，打起电灯，吃完了余下的几块压缩饼干，说实话，不喜欢吃压缩饼干。灯准备好，就这样沿着两山的中间朝仁多乡出发了，期待能早点到达。不知走了多久，听到几声狗叫，回过头来，看到两双发亮的眼睛，心里一惊，跟林哥说，保持我们刚才的脚步，不要露出怯意，继续前进。其实，我也不知道是啥子，反正在这种时候，最好的做法是保持正常的行进速度。又不知过了多久，都快十二点了，后面有好大的亮光，原来有辆车也是去往仁多乡。二话不说，我们自然是搭车前往喽，车上藏族同胞给我们香蕉，还有别的吃，一路诸多照顾。大概行进了个把小时吧，又是上山，又是下山的，我们最终到达了目的地，收拾／睡觉，不多说。

Find an open space, put on the lights, and finish the rest of the compressed biscuits. To be honest, don't like to eat compressed biscuits. The lights are ready, so We set off along the middle of the two mountains to the town of Renren, and We look forward to arriving early. We don't know how long We have gone, We heard a few barking, and when We looked back, We saw two pairs of bright eyes, and We was shocked. I said to Lin Ge, keep our footsteps, don't show your will, and move on. In fact, We don't know if it is a blind man. At this time, the best way is to maintain normal speed. We don't know how long it took, it was almost twelve o'clock, and there was a big light behind it. It turned out that there was a car that went to Rendo Township. Apart from anything else, we naturally take a ride to the bustle. The Tibetan compatriots in the car give us bananas, and there are other foods to take care of. Probably marched for an hour, it was up the mountain, and it was down the mountain. We finally reached the destination, packed up and slept, not much to say.
