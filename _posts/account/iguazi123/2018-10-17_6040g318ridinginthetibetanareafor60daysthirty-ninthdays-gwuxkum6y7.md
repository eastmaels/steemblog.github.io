昨天在县城里休息的非常棒，吃完早餐我们就出发了。今日天气也棒的很，顺风，骑行也愉快。骑行最怕逆风了，逆风能让平时时速20公里每小时，变成5公里每小时，那个折磨人，只有体会了才懂得起。刚出县城就到了G318与G219的分叉口，G318在这里就要拐向樟木口岸，G219开启，目的地狮泉河镇。2138公里里程碑，只有两千多公里就到叶城了，也是我们的目的地，纪念一下子。今天本打算骑行60公里的，但在路边一个湖泊休息吃午餐，贪恋湖光山色，走不动了。
Yesterday We had a good rest in the county town. We finished our breakfast. Today's weather is also very good, downwind, cycling is also enjoyable. Riding is most afraid of headwinds, and the headwind can make the usual speed of 20 kilometers per hour, which becomes to 5 kilometers per hour. The tortured person can only understand it if he understands it. Just out of the county town, you will arrive at the fork of G318 and G219. G318 is here to turn to Zhangmu Port, G219 is opened, and the destination is Shiquanhe Town. 2138 kilometers milestone, only two thousand kilometers to Yecheng, is also our destination, to commemorate all of a sudden. Today We was planning to ride 60 kilometers, but We had a rest at the lakeside on the roadside, and We was greedy for the lakes and mountains. I couldn’t move.

于是，我们就把装备推到湖边，安心来看成群的天鹅了，可能是天鹅想留我们吧。扎营，找食物，我和齐大哥还偷偷下河游了个泳，话说有太阳的时候好爽，木有太阳的时候冷死了。我们一边捡牛粪，一边围着湖走，真的漂亮，还看见一个放羊的藏民拿着牛粪煮酥油茶，好玩儿。帐篷搭完，真的是爽呆了，湖光山色、遍地牛羊，人间天堂。我趁机围着这个湖转了一圈，学学后藏去转个湖，真的累惨我了，到晚上才回到帐篷营地。
So, we pushed the equipment to the lake and watched the swans in groups. It might be that the swan wants to stay with us. Encampment, looking for food, I and Qi secretly went swimming down the river, saying that when there is a sun, it is so good, when the wood cover the sun, it is cold. We walked around the lake while we were grazing cow dung. It was really beautiful. We also saw a Tibetan sheep-raising Tibetan cow holding cow dung and cooking butter tea. It was fun. After the tent was finished, it was really cool, the lakes and mountains, the cattle and sheep everywhere, the paradise on earth. I took the opportunity to turn around the lake. After I learned to transfer to a lake, I was really tired and I went back to the tent camp at night.

天黑了下来，晚上我们一起篝火，湖边搭帐篷，夜空显得格外明亮。大概九十点的样子，组织去湖边抓鱼，一票人在一起玩，开心极了。晚上捕鱼时，月光照亮了整个湖面，好大的月亮，明亮，又美丽。一句话，藏区的夜很美。
It was dark quickly, and at night we camped together and set up tents by the lake. The night sky was particularly bright. About 9 o'clock, organized to go to the lake to catch fish, our play together, very happy. When fishing at night, the moonlight illuminates the entire lake. The big moon is bright and beautiful. In a word, the night in Tibetan areas is beautiful.
