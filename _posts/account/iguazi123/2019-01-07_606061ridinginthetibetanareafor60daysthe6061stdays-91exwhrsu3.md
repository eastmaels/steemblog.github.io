<center>http://cnstm.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/2019/01/IMG_6112.jpeg</center> <br/>写在前面，整个骑行过程说是60天，实则有超过，那就继续开始我的故事吧！

今日骑行从天天项目部出发，也就是新藏线K620处开始。早晨一起来林哥就开始补胎，他的旅行车真的难以抵抗这么恶劣的条件。补完胎、吃了早餐，我们开始出发，没多久就开始下冰雹，一粒一粒直拍打身体，冰雹击打地面又弹起来煞是好看。只是，对于我们骑行，那可是糟糕透了，这样让我们错过了阿克赛钦湖，新疆非常漂亮的一个湖泊。差不多中午时分，我们在一个废弃的工地做午饭吃。我拿出北京方便面和鸡蛋来煮，林哥又坐下来开始补胎，天空中还飘着雪，这样的场景也着实凄凉。骑行就是这样子，与大自然为伴，选择了远方，就必到达。吃完午饭经过一个盐碱地，据说有个甜水海兵站，过了盐碱地就开始爬山，后面一路的折腾，其实很多已经记忆模糊，那时真该养成写日记的习惯的。今天为了骑完这个无人区，也是铆足了劲，下午六点经过奇台达坂，海拔5170米，爬上达坂的时候已经累惨。经过达坂，就开始一路下坡，下到底天就开始黑了，那是的逆风超级大，吹得我们都骑不动。接下来就是在黑夜中骑行，今晚是到达不了大红柳滩的了，只能找个地方露营了。又是到夜晚十点的样子才找到一处废弃的道班，找好地方，煮饭吃，搭帐篷，开始睡觉，详细的就不说了。

露营的道班

第二天八点多就起来了，路程也艰苦，准备到达三十里营房住宿。早晨骑行了一个多小时的样子才到达大红柳滩，这里还蛮热闹的，找了一处川菜馆子吃早饭了。吃早餐的时候，和老板娘聊天，知道我是从成都过来的，竟然要介绍女儿给我们认识，也是惊讶。吃完出来休息的时候，遇见一波淘金的人，给我们讲述淘金的各种趣事，同时还拿出金子给我们看。路上挺好的，能遇见各种人，大多数都是善良友好的，大家都有故事，相互交换，就丰富了各自的生活。留下老板娘的手机，还有她女儿的微信号，终归是要出发，可惜的是最后没有变成丈母娘。

笔直的公路

铁骑 战神

往前走就是康西瓦，笔直的公路，旁边地上大坑小坑，远处能看到铁骑、战神几个字，这就是我国军队训练的地方。我们找了个僻静的地方开始享用午餐，说是享用，其实就是吃饼，据说旁边的公路是去往神仙湾哨所的。吃完午餐就看到了康西瓦烈士陵园，这里埋着几十位中印自卫反击战中牺牲的战士。骑行在昆仑山和另一处雪山之间，另外一边是喀喇昆仑山脉，K2所在地，也是海拔最高的地区。没有太大的一个难度，也就早早地到达了三十里营房，这里驻扎着很多军队，整个小城也还好。住在一个青旅，遇见一帮骑友，其中有个大哥来自深圳，他拿出地图给我看他骑行过的地方，真是中国西部都几乎走完了。四条沙漠公路、川藏、新藏、青藏，深圳飞人，你太厉害了。今晚因遇见这样的朋友而高兴，自然睡的是非常的巴适。

深圳飞人的脚步

Written in front, the whole riding process is said to be 60 days, but in fact there is more than that, then continue to start my story!

Today's ride starts from the Tiantian Project Department, which is the Xinjiang Tibet road K620. In the morning, Lin Ge began to repair the tires. His station wagon is really difficult to resist such bad conditions. After finishing the tires and eating breakfast, we started to set off. It didn't take long for the hail to start, and one shot and one shot of the body, and the hail hit the ground and bounced again. However, for us to ride, it was awful, so that we missed Lake Aksai Chin, a very beautiful lake in Xinjiang. At about noon, we had lunch at an abandoned construction site. I took out the instant noodles and eggs from Beijing to cook. Lin Ge sat down again to start the tire repair, and the sky was still snowing. This scene was also really bleak. Riding is like this, with nature, when you choose a distant place, you will arrive. After lunch, after passing through a saline-alkali land, it is said that there is a sweet water sea soldier station. After the salt-alkali land began to climb the mountain, the back of the road toss, in fact, many of the memories have been blurred, it is time to develop the habit of writing a diary. Today, in order to ride this unmanned area, it is also rugged enough. After 6 o'clock in the afternoon, it passes through the Qitai Daban, 5170 meters above sea level. It has been exhausting when climbing up to Daban. After Daban, I began to go downhill all the way. In the end, the sky began to darken. It was the headwind that was so big that we couldn’t ride. The next step is to ride in the dark, and I can't reach Dahongliutan tonight. I can only find a place to camp. It was only at 10 o'clock in the evening to find an abandoned road class, find a good place, cook rice, set up a tent, and start to sleep. The details are not mentioned.

At 8 o'clock the next day, I got up, and the journey was hard. I was ready to arrive at the 30-mile camp. I rode in the morning for more than an hour before I arrived at Dahongliutan. It was quite lively and I found a Sichuan restaurant for breakfast. When I was having breakfast, I chatted with my boss and knew that I was coming from Chengdu. I was surprised to introduce my daughter to us. When I finished eating and resting, I met a wave of gold rushers, telling us all kinds of interesting things about gold rushing, and also showed us gold. The road is very good. I can meet all kinds of people. Most of them are kind and friendly. Everyone has stories and exchanges, which enrich their lives. Leaving the boss's cell phone, and her daughter's micro-signal, it is necessary to start, but unfortunately, it did not become a mother-in-law.

Going forward is Conciwa, a straight road, next to the big pit on the ground, you can see the iron horse and the god of war in the distance. This is where the Chinese army trains. We found a secluded place to start eating lunch, saying that it was to eat, in fact, it was to eat bread. It is said that the road next to it was to the Shenxianwan post. After lunch, I saw the Conciwa Martyrs Cemetery, where dozens of soldiers who died in the Sino-Indian self-defense counterattack were buried. Riding between Kunlun Mountain and another snow-capped mountain, the other side is the Karakoram Mountains, home to K2, and the highest altitude. Not too much difficulty, I arrived at the 30-mile barracks early. There are many troops stationed here, and the whole small town is also good. I lived in a youth hostel and met a group of riders. One of my brothers came from Shenzhen. He took out a map and showed me where he had been riding. It was almost finished in western China. Four desert roads, Sichuan, Tibet, Xinzang, Qingzang, Shenzhen Feiren, you are too powerful. I am happy to meet such a friend tonight, and I naturally sleep very much. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from <a href='http://cnstm.org'>Steem中文社区</a> : http://cnstm.org/blog/2019/01/07/%e8%97%8f%e5%8c%ba%e9%aa%91%e8%a1%8c60%e6%97%a5%e7%ac%ac60-61%e5%a4%a9%e3%80%8c%e4%b8%80%e6%97%a5%e4%b8%89%e8%a1%a5%e8%83%8e%ef%bc%8c%e7%9d%a1%e9%81%93%e7%8f%ad%ef%bc%8c%e7%9e%bb%e4%bb%b0%e7%83%88/ </em><hr/></center>
