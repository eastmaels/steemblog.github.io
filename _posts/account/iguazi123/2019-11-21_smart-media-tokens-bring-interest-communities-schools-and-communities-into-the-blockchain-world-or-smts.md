<p>For the longest hour in my life, I’ve been thinking #steem is one of the best community platform, the #blockchain technology is great, ecosystem work flawlessly, and why hasn’t it thrive? Matter of fact, it seems on its way declining. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>一直以来，困扰Steem社区的一个问题是，Steem底层技术这么棒，经济模型也很不错，为什么一直没有爆发，反而是步步退却？ &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steem doesn’t have a sound business model, and to date we still haven’t seen any success within the #steem environment. If we were to put this entire ecosystem into a metaphor, it’s like our body is missing bone narrow density that create red blood cell. As the pioneer of #steem developer in China, we’ve been working very hard for the past one year, and all of this challenges has been in my mind all this while, we shall bring this to the table for discussion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steem没有清晰的盈利模式，也没有打造成功其商业闭环。如果把Steem比喻成一个经济体，即这个经济体暂时没有良性造血能力，我想这应该是主要原因吧。作为中国一支在Steem上开发了一年多的团队，我们一直在思考Steem的发展前景，这次就简单聊一聊。 &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Initially #steem has focusing on Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and in China similarly our aim is Baidu discussion board, Weibo, Wechat. These Chinese apps have been thriving in the past, but they have been declining for a fact that mobile device sale has been relatively low these days. Moreover, multimedia in China, basically has been taken over by WeChat, Weibo and Tiktok, and the trio has been fighting to be the top like forever. WeChat has started a new movement of – Mini Program(basically it’s a WeChat in-app application), and led to virtual war between small and medium network industries. According to Tencent latest financial report, they’ve exceeded 300million DAU for Mini Programs, and now feature verticle Mini Programs via Weixin Pay entry points for healthcare, mobility and smart retail services.(Source Cision https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tencent-announces-2019-third-quarter-results-300957456.html) Baidu, Ali, Tiktok and many other foreign investors has been investing into the development of Mini Program. In view of this, #steem has a long way to go if we were to catch up with the current champion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Steem初期对标的是Reddit、Facebook、Twitter，在中国就是百度贴吧、微信、微博。随着手机出货量增长的放缓，微信、微博、百度贴吧用户量已进入低速增长期。 中国的网民已基本被两微一抖所承包，互联网巨头陷入抢占用户时长的战争之中。微信开启了新的战场——小程序（微信生态内的App），开启生态系统的团战模式，大量网罗中小型互联网创业团队。根据最新腾讯财报，小程序日活跃用户超过3亿，百度、阿里、头条、360、美团纷纷布局小程序，小程序数量已超越App的数量。本来开放的Steem生态能通过团战与互联网巨头展开高维对低维的进攻的，这样看来，短期Steem无法与这些巨头在原有方向抗争。 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than often we talked about acknowledgement, that’s exactly what we needed in an online community. Have a look at Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, back in China we have WeChat, Weibo, has been servicing the community for long, and they understand client’s expectation, communication and able to fulfil many if not all of their requirement. #Steem on the other hand has been relying on incentivizing, self-regulatory and independence community seems lacking compare to the existing world. Especially when we dig down to user experience, high entry level(Let’s talk about resource credit when user are not invested), and lack of business revenue has always put #steem behind. I believe, #steem need to pay attention to these issue, had them iron out so we can strive to be better. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>一个网络社区，最重要的是社区归属感，即人们在社区中寻求被承认的需求是否被满足。Reddit、Facebook、Twitter、微信、微博通过这么长时间，对用户的社交、沟通等需求进行了很好的满足。Steem依靠目前人们并不太在意的激励贡献、社区自主及自治，还比较难在巨头林立的网络世界中找到突破口。尤其的是，Steem体验比较差、进入门槛高、可玩性有待提升、运营能力不足等进一步拖住了Steem前进的脚步。Steem迫切需要解决的是，找到新的突破口。 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smart Media Token is now live on a Testnet. SMTs are digital assets on the Steem blockchain that can be launched by anyone to help monetize online content and create incentives to encourage desired user behaviour. Despite the advancement of the technology, the existing challenges still need to be overcome as we discussed earlier as depending on incentivizing users can be dangerous. SMT will have to overcome this before it can come to a next level of success. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Smart Media Tokens登陆测试网为Steem带来了新的升级，其通过在网络用户和构建网络的企业家之间调整激励，将协作网络内的贡献价值与令牌联系起来，使得人们有史以来第一次能够在互联网上创建他们自己拥有的社区。这项突破有着巨大的破坏性。不过，即使如此，每个社区依旧会遇到Steem以往的问题，SMTs迫切需要寻找突破口。 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>SMTs brings a lot of memory from the beginning of WEB2.0, back then when internet were nourishing by new users, every city every category will have their own discussion forums, and many schools has their own BBS, everyone is happily making post/replying/interacting with other users to earn some tokens. In the internet era, developing, maintaining an APP can cost an arm and leg. Discussion forums, community project can never compete with social media APP in this case. And now, Mini Program can do the same as an APP, with merely RMB500 one can start to host a mini program with “NO CODE” development, and that will make this app continuously being updated and usable. For the same functionality APP as this Mini Program, it will cost 200 times more. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>SMTs让我想起了Web2.0刚开始的年代，各种自发网络社区涌现，每个城市都有论坛，每个学校有bbs，我们乐此不彼地发帖赚取金币，与社区里的人们交流。互联网时代，开发、运营App是一个成本比较高的事情，各小论坛只能坐视各社交媒体App抢占其用户，而无半点招架之力。现在诸多团队在小程序平台上进行开发，将小程序的开发成本拉到很低，你可以采取“No Code”开发，500人民币就可以拥有一个持续迭代、更新的小程序，而同样App的开发成本是这个的200倍。 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steem blockchain developed a decentralized database, in order to store two sets of data: one for token related matter, and the other set for content storage(blogs, discussion forums, votes etc). With this decentralized technology development in place, it make possible for public forums, schools, and local community to have their similarly BBS kind of frontend, to be built on top of #steem ecosystem. Especially Steem DAO can support the ecosystem and development. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Steem区块链通过构建一个分布式数据库，用来储存两件高可靠性冗余数据：与令牌有关的、以及与内容有关的数据（博客文章、评论、点赞等）。这为我们搭建了一个分散的内容管理系统和一个分散的令牌奖励系统，让城市里的论坛和学校、小区里的bbs有了搭建独立生态系统的可能。尤其的是，Steem DAO可支撑整个生态系统的持续开发和完善，以避免以往bbs平台的长久原地踏步。 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the existence of SMTs, anyone can launch their own token. At the same time, those who wish to develop their own community frontend is now possible, including comprehensive system management (similar to BBS,WordPress), and incentive system. When every city have their own community page (something like Facebook’s community page), every school have their webpage that similar to Facebook platform, and each of these pages has their own network that can manage ads and payment gateway, once all these being realized, Steem Blockchain can be unimaginably huge. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>借助SMTs，任何人都可以发行自己的令牌。同时，希望在上面构建社区的任何人可以非常迅速地使用该数据来构建自己的社区站点，包含内容管理系统（类bbs、wordpress）和令牌激励系统。如果每个城市都有无数个兴趣类Facebook社区，每个学校都有其类Facebook平台，每个小区也像学校一样，每个社交网络的广告价值和线下支付场景是显而易见的，一旦与Steem区块链集成，这将有着巨大不可想象的价值。 &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Further to that, Baidu, TouTiao.com, Ali, and many more western technology is heading to Mini Program direction, some of the developer already launched their own version of mini program via WordPress, surpassing WeChat, Baidu, TouTiao, WePay mini program. With this, many community project can be connected to mini program, and Smart Media Tokens is exactly what they’re looking forward to as well as what we’re expecting to achieve. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>更进一步，百度、头条、阿里、美团纷纷开启了其小程序生态的布局，有几支开发团队已通过wordpress等开发出了跨微信、百度、头条、支付宝的小程序平台。这让每个兴趣社群、学校社群、小区社群通过小程序接入区块链变得轻易而举，Smart Media Tokens在兴趣社群、学校、小区的应用有了更丰富的场景。 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that, community projects, schools, hobby groups all have their own geographical interest level. With the convenient of blockchain technology, individual initiative can pull together their local service provider and or other commercial businesses to joint together and become a small ecosystem of their own. For example, when you see school landing page, you can view local news through their social media platform, selling of pre-owned goods, finding a tuition services at surrounding area, or even initiate an activity of your own to earn some community token. By collaborating with the same participating business owners, to help promote their product, and or exchange the token for quick cash. Everyone in the ecosystem are valuable and each updates on the feed will bring value to the community, and anyone can start their own services or online shops, and even host an offline meetup, all these can be incentivizing and be put to good use in the community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>兴趣社群、学校、小区等都有着距离近，有一定地理围栏等优势，这为利用区块链技术将周边服务与社群纳入到一个整体的经济体系创造了更大的可能。如果你在一个学校，可以通过在学校的社交网络平台上发布附近的即时新闻、出售二手物品、给附近小区的孩子辅导功课、发起活动等赚取系统代币，然后在周边商家进行无缝消费，甚至兑换成现金。生态系统里的每个人都可以通过发布动态为社区增加价值，亦可开启其个人商店为社区提供服务，发布活动在线下聚会，最棒的是你创造的价值能即时得到体现，并在社区里使用。 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this, I think the greatest achievement of a #blockchain technology, is the ability to reproduce complete ecosystem for community projects in a smaller scale according to their ability and needs. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>我想，这是区块链的极大价值之所在了，通过区块链技术打造一个个小型生态系统的经济性。 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
