<center>http://cnstm.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/2018/11/IMG_5777.jpeg</center> <br/>这两天一直在赶路，没有咋个拍照，就并做一天来写了。早晨起来之后，就去旁边的一家商店买了两桶泡面，还补充了一点干粮。上午基本一马平川，不过是依然是一路的荒凉，有些地方还有点沙化。时间过去太久，现在回忆起来已经记不得多少了，只记得经过那不如村，就到达昆莎。昆莎有个机场，很多想到达阿里地区，但不想劳累的旅客，可直接坐飞机到达机场，然后做大巴到达阿里的首府——狮泉河镇就好。

We have been on the road for the past two days. And We only take a few photo and I wrote it for a day. After getting up in the morning, We bought two barrels of instant noodles and added a little dry food. In the morning, the basic one is flat, but it is still a desolate road. In some places, there is still some desertification. Time has passed for a long time, and now I can't remember much in my memory. I just remember that after going through the village, We arrived at Kunsha. There is an airport in Kunsha. Many passengers who want to get to the Ali area but don't want to get tired can fly directly to the airport and then do the bus to the town of Shiquanhe, the capital of Ali.

小垭口/达坂

过了昆莎，没过多久就开始翻越狮泉河达坂，山不高，但也不容易翻越。从山上朝下面看，风景很不错，虽然伴随着的还有大风和大雨。到达狮泉河达坂，上面用中文写着中国人民武装警察部队交通第四支队，说实话，我们能有这么好的路，都是武装警察为我们守护着。翻过达坂，就是一路的下坡，那个太爽了，不过天气有点不好。下山的路上看到阿里暗夜公园的指示牌，据说在那里观星空非常漂亮，有机会再去。到达狮泉河镇都很晚了，赶紧去边防大队开证明，幸好赶上了。在这种大地方，林哥还不好住宿，小的地方不接待，大的地方贵，我们没钱住。最后，跟旅店老板怎么说都不同意，我和林哥找了个地方搭帐篷睡了一晚。第二天去狮泉河镇公安开证明，也是蛮速度的。

After passing through Kunsha, it was not long before We began to climb over the Shiquan River. The mountain was not high, but it was not easy to climb. Arrived at Shiquanhe Daban, the Chinese squadron’s fourth detachment of the People’s Armed Police Force was written in Chinese. To be honest, we can have such a good road, and the armed police are guarding us. Turning over Daban, it is downhill all the way, that is too cool, but the weather is a bit bad. On the way down the mountain, I saw the sign of Ali Night Park. It is said that the starry sky is very beautiful and there is a chance to go there again. It was very late to arrive at Shiquanhe Town. I quickly went to the border defense brigade to open the certificate. Fortunately, I caught up. In such a big place, Lin Ge is not good to stay, small places do not accept, big places are expensive, we have no money to live. Finally, I didn’t agree with the hotel owner. I and Lin Ge found a place to sleep in the tent for one night. The next day I went to the Shiquanhe Town Public Security Bureau to prove that it was quite speedy.

离叶城只有1111公里了

狮泉河达坂，武装警察部队守护

第二天，我们弄好就继续出发了，天气很不好，一路下着雨。我们在翻越拉梅拉达坂的路上，很艰难，前后的能见度也很低，一不小心就看不到彼此了。不过，最后还是到达了最高点，之后开始下坡，下到山底需要过一个检查站。一路风景还是很棒，就是人累的不行，在傍晚时分终于找到一个落脚点。在一堆藏族人搭建的帐篷旁边，我们搭起了两个小帐篷。当然，藏民同胞给我们提供了很多帮助，那好像是个石料加工厂，反正人情味十足的。过去的都已经忘记，只记得那个时候非常棒，在路上，不知道会遇到什么，一起都是新奇的。这会儿坐在办公室，又想出去撒野去了。

The next day, we continued to leave as soon as we got it. The weather was very bad and it was raining all the way. On the way to Lamerada, it was very difficult, and the visibility before and after was very low. I couldn't see each other accidentally. However, in the end it reached the highest point, then began to go downhill, down to the bottom of the mountain needs a checkpoint. The scenery along the way is still very good, that is, people are tired, and finally found a foothold in the evening. Next to a pile of tents built by Tibetans, we set up two small tents. Of course, the Tibetan compatriots have provided us with a lot of help. It seems to be a stone processing factory, and it is full of human feelings. The past has been forgotten, just remember that time is very good, on the road, do not know what will happen, together are novel. I was sitting in the office at this time, and I wanted to go out and go wild.
