经历昨晚的大风大雨，今天收拾帐篷，我们的心是崩溃的，帐篷都湿了，幸好没有浸入帐篷内部。吃完早餐，我们继续沿着班公错前行，路上的心情都是舒坦的。穿过一个隧道，就要离开班公错了，还是不想和它挥手告别，最后留一个影吧！一离开班公错，迎面而来的就是雪山，在藏区看见雪山已经是稀松平常的事了，但每次看到都还想拍两张，可能对雪山有一种天生的热爱吧。

After the heavy winds and heavy rains last night, we packed up our tents today. Our hearts collapsed and the tents were wet. Fortunately, they did not immerse themselves in the tents. After breakfast, we continued to walk along the Pangong Tso, and the mood on the road was comfortable. Going through a tunnel, you have to leave the Pangong Tso, or do not want to wave goodbye to it, and finally leave a shadow! As soon as We left the Pangong Tso, it was the snow-capped mountains. It was a common occurrence to see the snow-capped mountains in the Tibetan areas. But every time I saw them, I wanted to take two shots. I might have a natural love for Snow Mountain.

最后看班公错两眼

雪山、湖泊与公路

离开班公错就是雪山

沿着河谷前行，路上风很大，行进非常艰难。这么好的路，竟然没有车来往，骑到中午，我们找了个桥洞下煮方便面吃，好不容易才生了火。吃完午餐，继续前行，沿着河谷，还是很棒，那一块有几座五彩的山，甚是漂亮。临近4点，有一个直角转弯的地方，突然天色大变，乌云密布，开始下起了雨。转角的地方，有个湖泊，远看很神秘，如果晴天说不定还能去看一哈，这天气，也就没多想。风景总是在路上，这一路遗憾蛮多的，只能以后有机会再来了。

Walking along the river valley, the road is very windy and the journey is very difficult. Such a good road, there is no car to go, riding to noon, we found a bridge to cook instant noodles to eat, it was difficult to have a fire. After lunch, go on, along the river valley, it is still very good, there are several colorful mountains, which are very beautiful. Near 4 o'clock, there was a right-angled turn, and suddenly the sky changed, the clouds were dense, and it began to rain. There is a lake in the corner, and it is very mysterious in the distance. If you can go to see it in the sunny day, the weather will not think much. The scenery is always on the road. This road is a lot of regrets, and I can only come back later.

奇形怪状的山脉

神秘的湖泊，真想去看两眼

转弯的地方也正是爬坡开始的地方，路上雨哗啦啦地下，我们骑着自行车爬山，什么也管不了，只管前行，一路还夹着冰雹。不知道那个时候是如何咬牙走过最后一段的，现在回忆，痛苦已经过去，只留下了到达目的地的喜悦。接近傍晚，我们到达多玛乡，立马脱下衣服、袜子，赶紧烤火。遇见一小哥，自带高压锅，跟我们一起借老板的火煮饭吃，只因老板这饭菜太贵，我们想节约一点。旅途中，我们尽量节约，也是体验到了很多平常不能体验到的，当然也有很多快乐。今晚，在旅店里休息，非常安逸，不用体验帐篷外的暴风雨了。

The corner is also the place where the climbing begins. The road is raining and falling. We ride the bicycle and climb the mountain. Nothing can be managed. Just follow the road and hold the hail all the way. I don't know how to get through the last paragraph at that time. Now, memories, the pain has passed, leaving only the joy of reaching the destination. Near the evening, we arrived at Dorma Township and immediately took off our clothes and socks and hurriedly fired. I met a little brother, brought my own pressure cooker, and borrowed the fire from the boss to eat with us. Just because the boss is too expensive, we want to save a little. During the trip, we try to save as much as we can, and we have experienced a lot of things that we can't usually experience. Of course, there are a lot of happiness. Tonight, rest in the hotel, very comfortable, do not have to experience the storm outside the tent.
