今早很不想起来，起来就要面对和大家的离别。不过，还是要出发，前方叶城等着我们呢。起来之后，吃了个早餐，买了一小袋大饼，防备路上没有吃的。离别的事就不描述了，虽然过去两年，仍旧历历在目。从昂仁县出发，过卡嘎镇进入G219国道，转角的地方一群饿狗，追着我们跑，完了还是有点惊魂未定。今天翻越两个垭口——帮拉山和嘎拉山，还好海拔不高，比较轻松。一路上都是重复的风景，那个时候看着都无感了，不过现在还是蛮想念的。
We really don't want to get up this morning. We have to face the parting with everyone. However, it is still necessary to leave, and Yecheng is waiting for us. After getting up, Lin and me ate a breakfast and bought a small bag of pancakes to guard against the lack of food on the road. Parting things are not described, although past two years, they are still vivid. Departing from Angren County, passing the town of Kayu into the G219 National Road, a group of hungry dogs in the corner, chasing us to run, and still a little shocked. Today, We crossed the two passes – bangla mountains and the Jura Mountains. Fortunately, the altitude is not high and it is relatively easy. There were repeated landscapes along the way. At that time, I didn’t feel it, but I still miss it.

帮拉山垭口

嘎拉山垭口

路过一个镇子，叫桑桑镇，一过镇子就开始起风，那个风，呼呼的吹，似乎不把你吹到不罢休。平时平地近20公里/小时的速度，那会儿，不好意思，5公里/小时，我们只期待风能小一点。眼睛在天堂，身体在地狱，这是最恰当的提现了。好不容易快到达目的地，竟然没找到适合搭帐篷的地方，风还是那么大，四周又荒芜人烟。我们两商量，回到刚才路过的一个石料加工厂看看，说不定那里有遮蔽之所。幸运的是，那里确实有工人废弃的住房，我们晚上可以不用在外面听风声了。在板房里搭帐篷，还是比外面好不知多少。
Passing through a town, called Sang Sang Town, once the town began to wind, the wind, the whistling blow, does not seem to blow you up. Usually at a speed of nearly 20 km / h, at that time, 5 km / h, we only expect the wind energy to be smaller. The eyes are in heaven and the body is in hell. This is the most appropriate withdrawal. It’s hard to get to the destination quickly, but We didn’t find a place suitable for tents. The wind is still so big, and it’s ridiculous. We both negotiated and went back to a stone processing factory that we had just passed, and maybe there was a shelter there. Fortunately, there are indeed abandoned houses for workers. We don’t have to listen to the wind outside at night. It’s better to have a tent in the board room than it’s outside.

一帮人，挺好，席地而坐，也不管旁边的美景

板房旁边有一户人家，估计是照看这个地方的主人。我们搭好帐篷之后，那家的男主人似乎回来了，我们过去烤了一会火，同时用他们的火做了一顿饭。这家子也是清贫，孩子还很小，眼睛大，非常害羞，我们给了他唯一剩下的糖果。虽然，他们家都听不懂汉语，我们也不懂藏语，但着实感动到了。不通语言，却对两个陌生人提供帮助，离开的时候还送了我们一壶开水，让我们去泡个脚，感激不尽。一路过来，藏民对我们的帮助太多了，我一直在想如何回报他们。骑行这些日子，有个深刻的感触，藏民都太淳朴了，没有他们，我们这一路会难很多。晚上，枕着凌厉的大风睡着的，不晓得明日会遇到啥子。
There is a family next to the board house, it is estimated to look after the owner of this place. After we set up the tent, the male owner seemed to be back. We used to bake for a while and made a meal with their fire. This family is also poor, the child is still small, the eyes are big, very shy, we gave him the only remaining candy. Although they can't understand Chinese at home, we don't know Tibetan, but we are really touched. Can't speak the language, but help two strangers. When We left, They also sent us a pot of boiling water. We are grateful. All the way, the Tibetans have helped us too much. I have been thinking about how to reward them. These days, there is a deep feeling of riding, Tibetans are too simple, without them, we will have hard on the roads. In the evening, sleeping with a fierce wind, We don’t know that We will encounter a scorpion tomorrow.
