今天出发都快十点了，昨天实在太累，多休息了一下，加上时区原因，阿里比北京要晚一到两个小时。今天的风景超级棒，一路都是沿着扎布耶错向前行，没看过茶卡盐湖，但扎布耶措是我们看过的最美的天空之城。今天天气也是超级棒，风平浪静，水面像一块很大的镜子，将蓝天白云倒映在湖中，配合这山、这水，恍如人间仙境。骑行当中，两边是不是冒出几只野生动物，赶紧拿起手机开始抓拍。

Almost ten o'clock today，We begin to go。Maybe we were too tired yesterday, and we took a rest. In addition to the time zone, Ali was one to two hours later than Beijing. Today's scenery is superb, all the way along the Zabuye lake, I didn’t see the Chaka Salt Lake, but Zabu Yecuo is the most beautiful lake we have seen. Today's weather is also superb, calm, the water is like a big mirror, reflecting the blue sky and white clouds in the lake, with this mountain, this water, like a fairyland. During the ride, there are a few wild animals on both sides, and quickly pick up the phone and start to capture.

扎布耶错，又称之为扎布耶茶卡，盛产锂矿，位列世界三大锂盐湖之中。湖泊有个特点，一湖分两半，南湖和北湖，南湖固液并存，北湖为卤水湖。盐湖中常年保持有一层深度不大、矿化度很高、呈饱和状态盐类溶液的湖水。旁边也有好些子锂矿车间，当然也有风马旗。南湖的很多地方被一格一格分割开来，采矿业是相当的发达。骑行中看到有一大群牦牛在湖边，非常壮观。在湖的最南端，有个点可以上去山顶，一览塔若错的风采，沿着山路走了一段，最后因为时间很短还是回到了主路。

Zabuye lake is also known as the Zabuye cake, which is rich in lithium mines and ranks among the world's three largest lithium salt lakes. The lake has a characteristic. One lake is divided into two halves, the south lake and the north lake, the south lake are solid and liquid coexist, and the north lake is a brine lake. In the salt lake, there is a layer of lake water with a small depth, high salinity and saturated salt solution. There are also some sub-lithium workshops next to it, and of course there are wind horses. Many places in Nanhu are separated by one grid, and the mining industry is quite developed. At the southernmost tip of the lake, there is a point to go up to the top of the mountain, to see the towering style of Tarot, walk along the mountain road, and finally return to the main road because of the short time.

今天一整天，基本沿着扎布耶错前行，到后面慢慢开始远离湖泊。一路的风貌也是奇特，可能现在的路，也是以前的湖岸吧。慢慢离开湖泊，左拐就继续向着仁多乡的方向行进。已近傍晚，进入到一大块盐碱地，路也是极其烂，简直无法骑行，我们开始下来推车。我们在这粗狂的大地找遮蔽物，找居民点，看到一个黑点就向它骑行加推车过去，最后终于在夜幕降临的时候找到了一个小村庄。那个村庄在一个山脚，离主路已经很远，村子很小，同样，没有人会普通话，即使上学的孩子也说不了几句。

Today, all day, We basically walked along Zabuye, and slowly began to move away from the lake. The style of the road is also peculiar, maybe the road now, and the lakeshore. Slowly leave the lake and turn left to continue in the direction of Rendo Township. Near the evening, entering a large saline-alkali land, the road is extremely bad, simply can not ride, we began to down the cart. We found shelter in this rough land, looked for a place to live, saw a black spot and rode it to the cart, and finally found a small village at night. The village is at the foot of a mountain, far away from the main road. The village is very small. Similarly, no one can speak Mandarin, even if the children attending school can’t say a few words.

幸运的是，今天也不用露宿荒野了，村民把我们安排进一家没有人住的屋子里，全村基本都过来了。他们帮我们生火，帮我们收拾，用一个词两个词的汉语跟我们交流，又一次被当做了稀奇。每每想到这些，无不感激藏民同胞对我们的帮助，不然这一路是难以走下来的。今晚就在这温暖的房子里睡着了，有床，真好！

Fortunately, there is no need to sleep in the wilderness today. The villagers have arranged us into a house where no one lives. The whole village has basically come. They helped us to make fire, help us clean up, communicate with us in a Chinese with one word and two words, and once again became a rare one. Every time I think of this, I am grateful to the Tibetan compatriots for helping us. Otherwise, this road is difficult to walk down. I fell asleep in this warm house tonight, and it’s good to have a bed!
