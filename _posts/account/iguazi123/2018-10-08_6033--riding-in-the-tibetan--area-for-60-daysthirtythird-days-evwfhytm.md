今天终于把两个垭口翻过来了，骑行50公里，终点在一个不知名的小学。

早晨是被一只小羊吵醒的，难道是我们占了它的地盘?早起继续野外做饭，吃完就开始爬坡，这一路坡度很大，不过很快就到达岗巴拉垭口。一路过来很多拉游客拍照的，其中就有昨天那个藏民，不多说。岗巴拉垭口还有藏族兄弟牵着藏獒拉拍照，说骑车、小孩和老人拍照不要钱，还给我们安排了热水。齐大哥抱着害怕的小六一在藏獒旁拍了一张，我们就在这做午饭了，好不热闹，藏族小孩也在旁边看着，蛮有意思的。

吃完午饭继续翻越第二个垭口，距离第二个垭口的时候遇见一个来自北京的小伙，骑着个车车，有意思的很，一起拍了一通的照片，很是好玩。终于到羊卓雍措这个垭口了，从这里看下去可以一览羊湖美景，非常震撼，难以用言语表达。恰巧那个时候晴空万里，蓝天白云，羊湖美得让人窒息。一路骑行，一路拍照，这骑行不带累的。

这种车安逸，但应该不适合开到藏区吧

大美羊湖，名副其实的三大圣湖之一

骑行下到了羊湖边边，不一会就到了一个村庄，我们打算继续骑行到前面一个镇进行扎营。但刚出这个村不到两公里，就开始狂风大作，吓得我们掉头就往回跑，回到村里找了个废弃的小学开始搭帐篷。藏区的天气真是阴晴不定，我们刚安顿好，天就晴了。前两天我们露天扎营，天一直下雨，今儿个有废弃的房屋遮蔽，却晴空万里，老天在戏弄我们吗？晚点去旁边小卖部买方便面的时候，遇见两个驻村干部，都是在内地上过学，回到自己家乡，为家乡做贡献。工资待遇比内地要好的多，两个人都挺不错的，我们聊了好一会。余下的就是各种耍，且听下回分说。

Today, We finally turned over the two top of passes, riding 50 kilometers and ending at an unknown primary school.

In the morning, I was awakened by a lamb. Is it that we occupied its territory? We started to cook in the wild in the morning, and began to climb after eating. This road was very steep, but it soon reached the Gangbala Pass. On the way, many Tibetans took pictures for tourists, including the Tibetans yesterday, not much to say. In the Gangbala Pass，the Tibetan brothers took pictures with Tibetan mastiffs, saying that bicycles, children and old people free to take pictures, and arranged hot water for us. Eldest brother Qi  took a scared little sixty-one and took a picture near to the Tibetan Mastiff. We just had lunch here. It’s so lively, Tibetan children are watching next, very interesting.

After lunch, We continued to climb over the second top of pass. When we was away from the second pass, We met a guy from Beijing. He was riding a motorcycle. It was very interesting. I took a photo together and it was very fun. We finally got to the mouth of Yamdrok, and We can see the beauty of the Yamdrok from here. It is very shocking and difficult to express in words. It happened that at that time, the sky was clear, the blue sky and white clouds, and the Yamdrok was so beautiful. Riding all the way, taking pictures all the way, this ride is not tired.

Riding down to the edge of Yamdrok, We will soon arrive at a village. We plan to continue riding to the previous town for camping. But just less than two kilometers from the village, it began to be a violent wind, scared us to turn back and ran back, went back to the village to find an abandoned primary school to start tents. The weather in the Tibetan area is really uncertain. We just settled down and the weather was fine. In the first two days, we camped in the open air. It was raining all day. Today, there are abandoned houses, but there are clear skies. Is God teasing us? Later, when I went to the side store to buy instant noodles, I met two cadres in the village. They all went to school in the inland and returned to their hometown to contribute to their hometown. The salary is much better than the mainland. Both of them are quite good. We talked for a while. The rest is all kinds of play, and tomorrow we will continue。
