早晨一起来，我们就商量是否继续前行。林大哥的车真的受不了了，签证到期的日子一天天临近，不然到时候只有回香港再办理巴基斯坦的签证，那样就太麻烦了。我们也推车两天，路太烂，每天前行的路程有限，看了一下前面的路，湖泊已经很少了，海拔都非常高。于是，我们俩决定先回到新藏公路G219主线，以后有机会再走。找了下昨晚载我们的藏族朋友，让他帮忙找车，仁多离主要公路远，阿里中线的中心，车子都好贵。不过幸运的是，找到一位藏族大哥，他给当地政府开车，恰好要回仲巴，于是我们决定坐他的车。我们在仁多的一家餐厅吃了早饭，说是餐厅，其实是一家旅店，类似青旅，好多俱乐部的旗子，看来户外爱好者遍布每一个地方。</p>
<p class="p2">Come together in the morning, we discuss whether to continue. Lin’s bicycle really can’t stand it, and the visa expiration date is approaching day by day. Otherwise, it’s too much trouble to go back to Hong Kong and apply for a visa to Pakistan. We also strolled for two days, the road was too bad, the daily travel was limited, and the road ahead was seen. The lakes were few and the altitude was very high. Therefore, we decided to return to the main line of the G219 on the Xinzang Highway, and we will have the opportunity to go later.We found the Tibetan friend who had loaded us last night and asked him to help find the car. Rendo was far from the main road. The center of the Ali midline was very expensive. Fortunately, We found a Tibetan brother who drove to the local government and just happened to return to Zhongba, so we decided to take his car. We had breakfast at a restaurant in Rendo, saying that it was a restaurant. It was actually a hotel. It was similar to the Youth hostel, a lot of club flags. It seems that outdoor enthusiasts are everywhere.</p>

一路这样的草原

<p class="p1">两年多是一个比较长的日子，其实今天回忆起来都比较模糊了。记得我们从仁多乡加油站出发，一路沿着昨晚回来的路前行，这时我们才看到，昨晚的路一样很难走。要是昨晚没有遇到他们，我们可能又是一个无比艰难的不眠夜。今天不到几个小时，把我们昨天一整天所走的都给回走了一遍，在康玛村右转拐向我一直想去的那个无名小湖。我们经过塔若错，到达一片高寒草原，这时候草都是枯的。藏族大哥说，塔若错是附近最大的湖泊，我们留了一些影，看着照片，发现我们两胡子好长了，衣服也褴褛，脸也好久没洗了，头发也乱，照片就不展示了。塔若错很大，很美，依旧是蓝天、白云、湖水，还有飞鸟。很喜欢这种感觉，向一个目标前行，中间能有蓝色的湖水相伴，跨过一道山岗，登高望远。越来越发现自己喜欢上了这种，荒漠的孤寂，也许在这里才能听到自己内心的声音。城市里太嘈杂，只有在这里，很少用手机，享受着与大自然独处的味道，每天的目标清晰，其实人生也比较简单，只是我们把它过复杂了。草原很大，实际上就是一片河谷地，我们在中间一家藏族茶馆吃了点东西，就继续出发，到达仲巴都已经下午了。</p>
<p class="p2">More than two years is a relatively long day. In fact, today's memories are rather vague. I remember that we started from the gas station in Rentuo Township, all the way back along the road that came back last night. At this time we only saw that the road last night was as difficult as it was. If we didn't meet them last night, we might be another insane night. In less than a few hours today, We went all the days we walked yesterday, and turned right at Kangma Village to the unnamed small lake I always wanted to go. We passed through Tarot and reached an alpine grassland, when the grass was dry. The Tibetan brother said that Taruo is the biggest lake nearby. We left some shadows and looked at the photos. We found that our two beards were long, the clothes were also awkward, the face was not washed for a long time, the hair was messy, and the photos were not displayed. The Taruo is very big and beautiful, still blue sky, white clouds, lake water, and flying birds. I like this feeling very much. Going forward to a goal, there is a blue lake in the middle, crossing a hill and looking up. More and more I found that I liked this, the loneliness of the desert, maybe I can hear my inner voice here. The city is too noisy, only here, rarely use mobile phones, enjoy the taste of being alone with nature, daily goals are clear, in fact, life is relatively simple, but we have complicated it. The grassland is very large. It is actually a river valley. We ate something in the middle of a Tibetan tea house and continued to leave. It was already afternoon in Zhongba.</p>

座驾
<p class="p1">我们准备继续前行，但风依旧很大，也许是累着了，我们决定今晚就回仲巴休息，明天直接搭车至冈仁波齐脚下。这真是一开始搭车了，就收不回来了，这连续几天应该叫做搭车之旅，我们找的借口还是签证快到期了，其实也算休息一下吧。第二天，我们搭上了一个藏族大哥的大货车，大哥会汉语，一直给我们讲阿里的奇闻异事，还有这边的民俗风情。一路的风景自然是美的，旁边就是开阔的河谷，雅鲁藏布江的上游就这这里，远处更是一字排开的雪峰，喜马拉雅山脉说的就是他们。中午在一家回族餐厅吃的午饭，因为藏族大哥说，回族不吃狗肉，怕藏族餐厅杀野狗给我们做菜。翻过马攸木拉山口，经过公珠错，很快就看到玛旁雍错和冈仁波齐了。远看冈仁波齐，美的很，尤其是在夕阳之下。明天再介绍被誉为世界中心的神山——冈仁波齐。今天我们先好好休息一晚。</p>
<p class="p2">We are ready to move on, but the wind is still very big, maybe it is tired, we decided to go back to Zhongba tonight, and take a ride directly to the foot of Gang Rinpoche tomorrow. This is really a ride at the beginning, it will not be able to collect it. This should be called a ride for a few days. The excuse we are looking for is that the visa is about to expire. In fact, it is a break. The next day, we got on a big truck of the Tibetan big brother. The big brother will speak Chinese. I have been telling us about Ali’s anecdotes and the folk customs here. The scenery along the way is naturally beautiful, next to the open river valley. The upper reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River are here. In the distance, there are snow peaks lined up in the distance. The Himalayas say they are. Lunch at a Hui restaurant at noon, because the Tibetan brother said that the Hui people do not eat dog meat, afraid that Tibetan restaurants kill wild dogs to cook for us. Turning over the Mazula Mountain Pass, after passing the Gongzhu wrong, I quickly saw Mabian wrong and Gangrenboqi. Looking forward to Gang Rinpoche, the beauty is very good, especially in the sunset. Tomorrow, we will introduce the god mountain, which is known as the center of the world, Gang Rinpoche. Today we have a good night off.</p>
