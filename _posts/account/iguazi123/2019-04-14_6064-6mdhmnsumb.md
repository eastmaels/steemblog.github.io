<center>http://cnstm.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/2019/04/2016-06-17-204223.jpg</center> <br/>今天新藏线最后一天的骑行了，自此两个多月的骑行就告一段落。今天的爬坡比较顺利，才两三百米的垂直高度，上午十点就到达今天的最高点了——阿喀孜达坂。这里比较简陋，就立了块石头，标注海拔3150米，这也是今天一天行程中海拔最高的地方。随着越来越靠近叶城，我们感受了迎面而来的热浪，算完整经历一次从冬天直接进入夏天的节奏。

随着下山到山脚，我们就引入了黄色、荒凉的世界，漫天的黄沙，只是少有几个绿洲。在中间一个村庄休息了一会，吃了点传统美食，就继续出发了。行走在沙漠中，唯一能感觉到的就是渴，又热又渴，仅有的几瓶水都非常节约。路上偶尔能看到骆驼，被这沙漠精灵折服。还有偶尔的油田，以及小范围的气流卷起来的沙尘，公路上都是沙粒。不过，靠近叶城的地方，发现好多地方在植树造林，大量的水灌溉着，有一些成效，但更多的是枯枝。看到有的工人将枯枝拔了，又准备种植新的树苗，为这精神点赞，也许过不了几十年，这里又出现一大批绿洲。

路上碰见几个旅游，背着大背包，准备徒步新藏线，甚是佩服。骑行已经不易，何况徒步，只能为他们加油、点赞！傍晚时分，到达叶城县城了，赶紧去零公里处拍照留影，宣告我们的整个骑行画下了圆满的句号。留影之后，就找地方邮寄物质，准备把车车寄回成都了，忙完都快十点了，叶城的天还是亮的。今晚，不是无眠，而是安安稳稳地睡了一觉，算是圆梦了吧！下来，好好去喀什耍两天，去乌鲁木齐耍两天，就回家喽！

Today, the last cycly day of the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway, and the ride for more than two months has come to an end. Today's climbing is relatively smooth, only two or three hundred meters of vertical height, arrived at today's highest point at 10 am - Akhdah. Here is a relatively simple, set up a stone, marked 3150 meters above sea level, which is also the highest altitude in today's day trip. As we get closer and closer to Yecheng, we feel the oncoming heat wave and count the rhythm of going straight into the summer from winter.

As we went down to the foot of the mountain, we introduced a yellow, desolate world, and the yellow sands of the sky were just a few oases. After a break in the middle of the village, I ate some traditional food and continued to set off. Walking in the desert, the only thing that can be felt is thirst, hot and thirsty, and only a few bottles of water are very economical. Occasionally, the camel can be seen on the road and is convinced by this desert elf. There are occasional oil fields, as well as sand dust that is rolled up in a small area, and sand is on the road. However, near Yecheng, many places were found to be afforested, a large amount of water was irrigated, and there were some effects, but more were dead branches. Seeing that some workers will pull out the dead branches and prepare to plant new saplings, they will like this spirit. Maybe it will not be a few decades, and there are a lot of oases here.

I met a few tourists on the road, carrying a large backpack and preparing to hike the new Tibet line. I admire it. Riding is not easy, let alone hiking, can only cheer for them, like! In the evening, I arrived at Yecheng County. I quickly took a photo at zero kilometers and announced that our entire ride had been drawn to a successful conclusion. After taking pictures, I found a place to mail the materials, and I was ready to send the car back to Chengdu. It was almost ten o'clock, and Yecheng's day was still bright. Tonight, it’s not sleepless, but An An’s steady sleep, it’s a dream! Come down, go to Kash for two days, go to Urumqi for two days, go home! <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from <a href='http://cnstm.org'>Steem中文社区</a> : http://cnstm.org/blog/2019/04/14/%e8%97%8f%e5%8c%ba%e9%aa%91%e8%a1%8c60%e6%97%a5%e7%ac%ac64%e5%a4%a9%e3%80%8c%e7%a9%bf%e8%bf%87%e6%b2%99%e6%bc%a0%ef%bc%8c%e6%8a%b5%e8%be%be%e9%9b%b6%e5%85%ac%e9%87%8c%e5%a4%84%e3%80%8d/ </em><hr/></center>
