昨晚狂风大雨，我们又在楼上，担心了一晚上。今天路程比较短，仅仅7公里的上坡后，就一直下坡和平路，加上天气不错，我们很早就到达了拉孜。下坡的时候遇见一个大哥，厉害的呢，骑着一辆普通的自行车，后座还有麻袋七七八八的东西，活的像一个神仙似的。后面还会多次遇到这位大哥，真的是太厉害了。到达垭口，看见几个外国人骑着HONDA摩托，真是不错。一看到我就要一起合影，还录制视频，用自己憋足的英语和他们聊了两句就开始下坡了。
Last night, the wind was heavy and we were upstairs, worried about one night. Today's journey is relatively short. After only 7 kilometers of uphill, it has been downhill and peaceful road. Plus the weather is good, we arrived at La transcribing county very early. When I went downhill, I met a big brother. It was amazing. He is rode an ordinary bicycle. There were sacks and some things in the back seat. He was like a god. I will meet this big brother many times later, it is really amazing. It’s good to arrive at the pass and see a few foreigners riding a HONDA motorcycle. They ask to take a group photo together as soon as they saw me, They also recorded a video and I talk with them in my poor English.

神一般的存在

多彩头

拉孜也是一幅农忙的样子，大家都忙着耕种，这牛头上都有红色的絮絮，应该是图喜庆，好彩头吧！这边藏族人的衣服贼亮，从老人到小孩脸上都是黢黑黢黑的，也许真应了那句话“他们的身体很脏，但心灵很纯净”。在县城我们补了一点装备，到处玩。六一的精力太旺盛，风一样的女子，我们六个大人被她折腾的累的很。小家伙挨个屋里跑，到处充满喜悦，小六一太可爱了。今天就好好休息，也算休闲骑了。
La transcribing county is also a busy farmer. Everyone is busy with farming. There are red shards on the bull's head. It should be a happy picture, good color! Here, the clothes of the Tibetans are bright, and the faces of the old people and the children are dark . Perhaps it is true that "their bodies are dirty, but the mind is pure." In the county town, we buy somethings and played around. The Liuyi is too active, like the wind when her runs, the six of us are very tired of her. The little guy ran out of the room, full of joy everywhere, the little six one was too cute. Have a good rest today, It is also a leisure ride.
