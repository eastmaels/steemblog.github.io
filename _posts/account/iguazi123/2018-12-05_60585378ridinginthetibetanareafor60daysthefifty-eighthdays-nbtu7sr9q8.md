<center>http://cnstm.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/2018/12/IMG_5971.jpeg</center> <br/>今天的骑行任务有点艰巨，很早就起来了。在旅店吃了点早餐就开始出发，没过多久就遇到一个检查站，一系列繁琐的操作后终于过站。再向前骑行是一片荒野，异常地空旷，不过路还是修的不错。自从新藏公路重新修整之后，进出西藏的条件得到了很大的改善，沿路的生活水平也得到了一定的提高。现在新藏公路和川藏公路都是全程柏油马路，堪比内地的高速公路，由武装警察部队进行维护，在如此高海拔的地区保证我们的出行安全，中国武警是最可爱的人。

Today's cycling mission is a bit difficult and we got up very early. After eating a breakfast at the hotel, We started to set off. It didn't take long before We met a checkpoint. After a series of cumbersome operations, We finally passed the station. Riding forward is a wilderness, unusually empty, but the road is still well repaired. Since the re-construction of the Xinzang Highway, the conditions for entering and leaving Tibet have been greatly improved, and the living standards along the road have also been improved. Now the Xinzang Highway and the Sichuan-Tibet Highway are full-scale asphalt roads. They are comparable to the mainland's expressways and are maintained by armed police forces. To ensure the safety of our travels in such high-altitude areas, the Chinese armed police is the most lovely person.

无处不在的雪山

下午四点多，我们看见一个冰川河，于是在随身携带的桶里装满了雪，以备行进途中的淡水补充。在冰川河旁边耍了一会，我们在旁边一个桥边搭起了炉灶，开始煮方便面了，今天的午餐是北京方便面加一根黄瓜，吃饱了好继续出发。风很大，我们好不容易生了火，煮了东西吃。吃饱喝足，就开始翻越红土达坂，海拔5378米，骑行经过的最高海拔了。最后，虽然不易，但我们俩还是站到了红土达坂的里程牌旁边。

At four o'clock in the afternoon, we saw a glacier river, so the buckets carried around were filled with snow for fresh water supplements on the way. Playing for a while next to the glacier river, we set up a stove next to a bridge and started to cook instant noodles. Today's lunch is a instant noodles in Beijing with a cucumber. The wind is very big, we are so hard to have a fire, cook something to eat. After eating and drinking, I began to climb over the red clay, reaching an altitude of 5,378 meters, the highest altitude of the ride. Finally, although it is not easy, the two of us still stand next to the milestones of the red clay.

装一桶雪，留作淡水用

北京方便面、鸡蛋、还有少见的黄瓜

远看山包，近看山峰

接下来，就是一路下坡，路虽然不错，但到达松西村还是晚上九点半了,不过天还没黑。路上遇见一群藏羚羊，大约有50来只，在落日的余晖下，藏羚羊在草场上吃草、奔跑，与大自然融为一体。松西村遇见一群正骑新藏线的人，有位女生有了高反的症状，正在讨论是否继续下去呢。松西村海拔5200多，新藏线上无人区前最后一个村庄，接下来就是200多公里的无人区了。如此高的海拔，不管是骑行还是旅行的朋友一定要多加注意，以身体为重。明天挑战无人区，今天好好休息一晚吧！

Next, it is all the way downhill, although the road is good, but arrived at Songxi Village is still at 9:30 in the evening. On the road, I met a group of Tibetan antelopes. Under the glory of the setting sun, Tibetan antelopes graze and run on the pastures, blending with nature. Songxi Village met a group of people who were riding the new Tibet line. One girl had high anti-symptoms and was discussing whether to continue. Songxi Village is more than 5,200 meters above sea level. The last village in front of the no-man's land on the Xinzang line is followed by more than 200 kilometers of no-man's land. Such a high altitude, whether it is riding or traveling friends must pay more attention to the body weight. Challenge the no man's land tomorrow, take a good rest today!

竟然有砌好了的沟渠，太不易
