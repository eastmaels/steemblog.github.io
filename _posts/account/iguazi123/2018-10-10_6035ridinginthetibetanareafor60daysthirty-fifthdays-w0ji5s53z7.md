<p class="p1">昨晚一晚睡的安逸，在四川老乡馆子里搭的帐篷。今日骑行一路的逆风，中途遇见了专门来看小六一的一家子，还给我们留了好多吃的，还有一路的游客跟着合影拍照。终于到达垭口，卡若拉山，旁边有着卡若拉冰川。据说当年拍摄《红河谷》的时候炸掉了三分之一的冰川，真实的雪崩情景，剧组人员在卡若拉冰川上用炸药炸了一个巨大的三角形缺口。我服了！古老的冰川就这么让这些人给破坏了，永远无法弥合。垭口的经幡特别好看，挂在垭口路的正上方，迎着阳光，美丽极了。</p>

<p class="p1">last night，I slept in a comfortable in the Sichuan fellow's restaurant. Today, riding through the headwind, we met a family specially to see little 61, they also left a lot of food, there are tourists along the road to take photos with us. Finally we got to the pass, mount karora, with the karora glacier next to it. It is said that a third of the glacier was blown up when the "Red River" was filmed. It is a pity that there is a big piece missing in order to show the real scene. The prayer flags in the pass were very beautiful. They were hanging right above the road in the sun.</p>

<p class="p1">垭口团队合影后，继续下一个垭口，斯米拉山垭口，相对好爬一些，到达江孜县城天都快黑了。今天一整天，天气非常棒，一路的太阳，骑行了有102公里，对于带着小六一的齐大哥确实不容易了。路上还遇见了贴满牛粪等待晒干的藏民居，藏区物资匮乏，生火的东西也稀缺，牛粪燃烧产生的热量能给大家带来温暖，在藏地，干牛粪、羊屎豆都是重要的燃料。</p>

<p class="p1">After our team took a group photo, continue to the next pass, smira mountain pass, relatively easy to climb a few, reach jiangzi county, the day is almost dark. Today, the weather is very good , the sun along the way, cycling for 102 kilometers, it is really not easy to bring little brother qi. On the way, there were Tibetan houses covered with cow dung and waiting for drying. There was a shortage of materials in Tibetan areas, and there was a shortage of things to make fire. The heat generated by the burning of cow dung can bring warmth to people.</p>

卡若拉冰川，位于西藏浪卡子县与江孜县交界处的卡若拉山口（海拔5020米），是西藏三大大陆型冰川之一。卡若拉冰川背靠西藏四大神山之一的乃钦康桑峰（海拔7191米）南坡，冰川面积约9.4平方公里。  卡若拉冰川因电影《红河谷》和《江孜之战》在此拍摄外景而名气大增，游客从羊卓雍湖下来后前往江孜途中，必经卡若拉冰川。
