今天早起出发，还有点不习惯，之前都是我们六个一起洗漱、吃早餐，然后整队出行，今天却只有我们两个了。吃了一张大饼，煮了个方便面，吃饱了好爬垭口。一出门就开始爬坡，在快到垭口的地方竟然再次遇见那位大哥。他坐在路边打盹，车子也停在旁边。我们停下来，走过去问他是否需要帮助，大哥说不需要，给他东西也不要，就跟这位大哥聊了几句。
It’s a bit of a habit to start early today. Before，we were six, we washed and had breakfast, and then the whole team traveled. Today we only have two of us. We ate a big cake, cooked an instant noodles, and ate a good meal. When We went out, We began to climb the slope, and We met the big brother again in the place where We was meet near the mouth. He sat on the side of the road and his bicycle stopped nearby. We stopped and went over to ask if he needed help. The older brother said that he didn't need it. We talk to the big brother.

老大哥的包裹

他昨晚就在我们准备露营的地方休息的，我们昨晚再骑一段就到了。大哥跟我们说，他从河北出发，到达厦门，厦门有人给他了这辆破自行车，他就用这自行车从厦门，骑到了贵州，然后到了成都，最后通过拉萨，到达这里。路上他买了一袋米，都没怎么煮，一直放在车架上，垫着那包东西。那个包很大，七七八八的东西，也不晓得是什么，但正是这让大哥走到了现在。感觉这个大哥太棒了，想去，就出发了，还到达了。不想路上遇见的那个小伙子，一路搭车去偏远县城骗政府的补助，假装自己没钱回家。真是旅行路上什么样的人都有。
Last night  ，He rested at the place we were preparing for camping. The Brother told us that he started from Hebei and arrived in Xiamen. Someone gave him this broken bicycle in Xiamen. He used this bicycle to ride from Xiamen to Guizhou, then to Chengdu, and finally to Lhasa. On the way, he bought a bag of rice, didn't cook it, kept it on the frame and padded the bag. The bag is very big, and it doesn't know what it is, but it is this that makes the brother come to the present. We feel that this big brother is great. We want to go, We leave and We arrive. We don’t want to meet the guy on the road, all the way to the remote county to lie to the government’s subsidy, pretending that he has no money to go home. It’s really what kind of people are on the road.

出生年同款里程碑

翻过垭口，一路下行还是非常爽，但要捏好刹车，尤其是在下坡之前检查刹车是否完好。骑行最巴适的时候，就是下坡路，不用怎么踏车，爽的很，享受飞的感觉，只要不飞出去就好，一定要控制好速度。一路就这样，下到了谷底，沿着一个河流骑行，虽然两旁的山壁有点吓人，但骑行要舒服很多。河里好多野生动物，在这样荒凉的地方，看到这么多小东西，还是藏民保护的好。不一会就骑行到了一个湖泊，环湖骑行，刚骑过就出现一个大草原，我们的午饭就在草原上一个藏民茶馆解决了。吃完藏地特色套餐——方便，我们继续前行，骑行嘛，就是不断向前，这也是我们能到达目的地的原因。
Turning over the cornice, it is very cool all the way down, but you need to pinch the brakes, especially if you check the brakes before going downhill. When riding the most suitable, it is downhill, no need to tread the bicycle, cool, enjoy the feeling of flying, you must know do not fly out, and you must control the speed. All the way, it is down to the bottom of the valley, riding along a river, although the mountain walls on both sides are a bit scary, but the ride is much more comfortable. There are so many wild animals in the river. In such a desolate place, seeing so many small things is still good for Tibetans to protect. After a short ride, I rode to a lake, riding around the lake. Just after riding, there was a prairie. Our lunch was solved in a Tibetan teahouse on the grassland. After eating the Tibetan specialties package - convenient, we continue to move forward, riding, it is constantly moving forward, which is why we can reach the destination.

河里的野鸭，还蛮好看的

藏族茶馆泡方便面

翻了一个山，过了几个村，还经过一个道班，还是没有找到住宿的地方。风那么大，天气也冷，也到傍晚八九点了，我们看那有个桥洞，想着就在那借宿一宿吧。好不容易下桥洞，探了一探，桥洞底下，前面一个羊头，后面一个，旁边还有一只小狗的尸体，心底还是有点小害怕的。但决定在此住下，周边也没有更好的地方了，还是在此扎营了。周边去找了些柴火，生火烤一下冰冷的身体。晚上睡觉前，找了几个大棒子放身边，两个人的帐篷也挨的老近了，还是害怕这边狼群出没。如此荒凉之地，两条路的交叉路口，竟然没有啥人，心里确实有点担心。
We turned over a mountain, passed several villages, passed a road, or found no place to stay. The wind is so big, the weather is cold, and it is eight or nine o'clock in the evening. Let's see that there is a bridge hole, thinking about staying there overnight. Finally, We went down the bridge and explored it. Under the bridge, there was a sheep's head in front, one behind, and the body of a puppy next to it. The bottom of my heart was still a little scared. But decided to stay here, there is no better place around, or camp here. Go around and find some firewood, and grill the cold body. Before going to bed at night, We found a few big sticks and put them around. The tents of the two people were also close, and We were afraid that the wolves would be there. Such a desolate place, the intersection of the two roads, there is no swearing, and my heart is really worried.

路上的湖泊

也怪我自己，前两天网上看到了阿里中线“一错再错”，就中毒了，偏要去那美的无法说的地方骑行看看去，只是那里人很少。搭帐篷这方面，我们后来也想了一下，决策失误，咋个能在桥洞地下搭帐篷了，如果当晚发水，岂不是悲剧，以后不敢了。今天想来，那晚的记忆除了恐惧，害怕狼群出现，另外记忆最深刻的就是夜晚的星空了，立体的，太美了，也许是我在藏区见过最美的星空了。可惜的是，相机不在身边，我们两都只有手机。不说了，晚上都在担忧中度过的，过几日再续。
We also blame myself. I saw the Ali midline "one mistake and then wrong" on the Internet two days ago. I was poisoned. I wanted to go to the beautiful place where I couldn’t say it, but there were very few people there. In this aspect of tents, we later thought about it. We make mistakes in decision-making, we cloudn’t set up a tent in the underground of the bridge. If it is water in the evening, it is not a tragedy. We will not dare in the future. In addition to fear, the memory of that night is afraid of wolves. The most memorable memory is the starry sky at night. Stereoscopic, so beautiful, maybe We have seen the most beautiful starry sky in Tibetan areas. It is a pity that the camera is not around, we only have mobile phones. If you don't say it, you will spend it in the evening and continue in a few days.
