早晨起来，就和深圳飞人分别，他走向阿里首府——狮泉河镇，然后去往阿里北线，我则沿着新藏线去往叶城。离别常遇到，还是有些伤感，只期望后面有机会再见了。在离开三十里营房的时候，有一个哨卡，排了很久的队才过了这个哨卡。

今天依旧沿着河谷前进，河谷边的羚羊也多了起来。行走在河谷边，旁边就是落石区，还是有些胆战心惊。路上遇见了几个正向骑行的骑友，其中还有女生，和她的男友一起来骑行。新藏线，也算一条爱情告白的心路历程。给了他们一些忠告和前面路上的信息，就开始翻越4900米的黑卡子达坂。路比较烂，灰很多，新增线上最烂的路段了，不过幸好很快就翻越过去了。突然，很想念骑行的时光，每天只想着骑行，有一个远方在激励着自己。其实，从2016年骑行开始，我的人生轨迹从此开始发生巨大转变。骑行前，在公司上班，有稳定的工作，还算可以的薪水，每天生活很固定。骑行后，在进行各种探索，似骑行一般，有着一个目的，每天为它奋斗着，可是那不比骑行，似乎很难到达，现在也还在前行的路上。

过了黑卡子达坂，我们在路上看到有一些玉，质量不是很好。我们还寻思着，如果运气好的话，能否捡几块极品玉石呢。都是遐想，路还是要继续走下去的。前面的道路越来越狭窄，仿佛山上的石头就要落下来似的，旁边的河流在阳光的照射下，异常漂亮，网上很多美丽的照片应该就在这里拍出来的吧！

路上遇到几次风雨，很多细节已经忘记了，下次骑行得带一个Go Pro，记录下骑行的经历。记得，我们一路在找废弃的房子，找着找着，竟然到达了麻扎兵站，那个时候，天已经黑了几个小时了。在一个旅店里，我们住了下来，老板给我们做了点吃的。很多事情，现在想起来，不知那个时候如何过的，旅途的疲惫已过去，留下了整个骑行美好的回忆。好久没写了，还有两天就到达叶城，明天再写吧！

When I got up in the morning, We Separate from Shenzhen Feiren. He went to the town of Shiquanhe, the capital of Ali, and then went to the northern line of Ali. I went to Yecheng along the Xinzang line. Parting is often encountered, but I still a little sad, I only hope that there will be a chance to see him later. When leaving the 30-mile barracks, there was a checkpoint card, and wait for a long time to passed the checkpoint.

Today, along the river valley, the antelopes along the river valley have also increased. Walking along the river valley, next to the falling stone area, still a little scared. On the road, I met several riders , including a girl, riding with her boyfriend. The new Tibet line is also a journey of love confession. After giving them some advice and information on the road ahead, we began to climb over the 4,900-meter black card. The road was bad, the gray was a lot, and it is the worst road , but fortunately it quickly passed over. Suddenly, I miss the time of riding.There is a distance that inspires myself.  We only ride every day. In fact, since the start of cycling in 2016, my life trajectory has changed dramatically. Before riding , I have a stable job, get a salary, and my life is very fixed every day. After riding, I have been exploring all kinds of things. Like ride , have a purpose to fight for it every day, but it is no harder to ride than to ride. I am still on the way now.

After arrived the black card, we saw some jade on the road, the quality is not very good. We are also thinking about, if we are lucky, can we pick up a few pieces of the best jade? It’s all delusional, and the road still has to go on. The road ahead is getting narrower and narrower, as if the stone on the mountain is about to fall. The river next to is very beautiful under the sunlight. Many beautiful photos on the Internet should be photographed here!

A few winds and rains on the road, many details have been forgotten, the next ride I think I should take a Go Pro, record the experience of riding. I remember, we were looking for an abandoned house all the way, looking for it, and actually arrived at the Mazha station. At that time, it was already dark for a few hours. In a hotel, we stayed and the boss gave us something to eat. The exhaustion of the journey has passed, leaving a good memory of the whole ride. We will arrived in Yecheng in two days, and I will write it tomorrow! <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from <a href='http://cnstm.org'>Steem中文社区</a> : http://cnstm.org/blog/2019/04/06/%e8%97%8f%e5%8c%ba%e9%aa%91%e8%a1%8c60%e6%97%a5%e7%ac%ac62%e5%a4%a9%e3%80%8c%e8%b7%af%e9%81%87%e6%83%85%e4%be%a3%e6%ad%a3%e9%aa%91%ef%bc%8c%e8%bf%87%e9%bb%91%e5%8d%a1%e8%be%be%e5%9d%82%ef%bc%8c/ </em><hr/></center>
