<center>http://cnstm.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/2018/11/IMG_5671.jpg</center> <br/>为了一天能转完冈仁波齐，今早五点的样子就起来了。那个时候，天还是没亮，尤其的是阿里地区比内地还要晚一两个小时。早起，还有一个好处，跟着藏族人一起，真实体验转山的旅程。

In order to finish the Gang Rinpoche in one day, the appearance of five o'clock this morning will rise. At that time, the day was still not bright, especially the Ali area was an hour or two later than the mainland. Getting up early, there is also a benefit, along with the Tibetans, the real experience of the journey to the mountains.

天刚刚亮

冈仁波齐的沟壑

一路上，人还蛮多的，都是抹黑前进，我们两也走在人群中，跟着大家向前走。随着天微微亮起来，冈仁波齐的面孔终于向我们展开，我们也终于看到了我们走的路，沿着河谷在行走。近距离看冈仁波齐，真的很美，转山的过程中也让自己的心平静了下来。路遇一个藏族小伙子，他一边转山一边帮转山的人背负东西，行走的飞快。据说，他自己转山都几十次了，他给我们讲述，很多藏族同胞转山有几百次的，真的佩服他们对宗教的虔诚。

Along the way, there are quite a few people who are smearing forward. We are also walking in the crowd and following everyone. As the sky lit up slightly, the face of Gang Rinpoche finally came to us, and we finally saw the way we walked and walked along the valley. Looking at Gang Rinpoche at a close distance is really beautiful. In the process of turning the mountain, my heart is calmed down. The road meets a Tibetan young man. He turns the mountain and helps the people who turn the mountain to carry things and walk fast. It is said that he has turned his own mountains dozens of times. He told us that many Tibetan compatriots have turned hundreds of times and really admire their religious devotion.

路上也能看到很多印度人，还有好多印度人骑马下山，人估计高反了，骑在马背上很不舒服的样子。印度人也崇拜冈仁波齐，他们从普兰口岸来到中国，朝拜冈仁波齐。据说他们相信湿婆就住在冈仁波齐。冈仁波齐被世界上四大宗教称之为世界的中心，藏传佛教、印度教、苯教、耆那教都认为自己的产生于这里有着千丝万缕的联系。正因为此，印度人即使会高反，也要过来朝拜神山圣湖。离近看，可看到冈仁波齐的沟壑真构成了佛教里面万字的图案，很是神奇。

Many Indians can be seen on the road, and many Indians are riding down the mountain. People are estimated to be high-reverse, and riding on horseback is very uncomfortable. Indians also worship Gang Rinpoche, who came to China from the Puland port and worshiped Gang Rinpoche. It is said that they believe that Shiva lives in Gang Rinpoche. Gang Rinpoche is called the center of the world by the four major religions in the world. Tibetan Buddhism, Hinduism, Bonism, and Jainism all believe that their own origins are inextricably linked. Because of this, even if the Indians will be high-reverse, they will come to worship the holy mountain lake. From a close look, you can see that the gully of Gang Rinpoche really constitutes the pattern of the four-character in Buddhism, which is very magical.

向神山致敬

山路其实不易

石头

路上都有很多茶馆，大家在里面喝茶、娱乐，或休息，价格也算合适。走到中午，竟然看到好几个藏族人竟然一步一扣头，虔诚地在拜冈仁波齐，这究竟要多久才能转完？来藏区之后，很多举动难以想象，当然也反映出了他们深刻的信仰。走到今日最高的一个垭口，估计有5650米，整片的风马旗，还有好些藏族在这里洒马达，五颜六色，甚是漂亮。马达随风飘散，象征着对山的崇拜，与自然的密切联系。走过垭口，下面有几个牛奶海，很是有意思。再往下走，就是一个延伸下来的冰川，经过的时候要特别小心。后面一段就是在一个河谷里行走了，一路的巨石，上面有着六字真言，还有万字的标识。路上人很多，也都疲惫不堪，我们也累的够呛。最后到达住所，都已经是晚上九点了，林哥的脚上也长了泡。据说，藏族人一天可以转完，汉族一般都是两三天转完，我们能一天走完，也是很棒的了。

There are many teahouses on the road, everyone drinking tea, entertainment, or rest, the price is also appropriate. When I arrived at noon, I saw that several Tibetans had turned their heads one by one and piously in Baigang Rinpoche. How long will it take to finish? After coming to Tibet, many actions are hard to imagine, and of course they reflect their deep beliefs. Going to the highest pass today, it is estimated that there are 5,650 meters, the whole wind horse flag, and many Tibetans sprinkle the motor here, colorful, very beautiful. The motor drifts with the wind, symbolizing the worship of the mountains and the close connection with nature. Walking through the cornice, there are several milk seas below, which is very interesting. Going further down is an extended glacier, so be careful when passing. The latter paragraph is walking in a river valley, all the way to the boulders, there are six-character mantras, and the four-character logo. There are a lot of people on the road, and they are all exhausted, and we are tired enough. Finally arrived at the residence, it is already nine o'clock in the evening, and Lin Ge's feet are also growing. It is said that the Tibetans can finish the day, and the Hans usually turn around in two or three days. It is great that we can finish the day.

漫山的风马旗

牛奶海

今天回忆起来，很多记忆已经非常模糊，写文也像记流水账，不过好在有steem，让我能慢慢写下这些东西。也感谢，有那么一些人，在看，激励我写下去。晚上朋友传来玛旁雍错的照片，也是美爆了，感谢藏区，让我们体验到不一样的美。

Recalling today, a lot of memories are very vague, writing a text is like a running account, but fortunately there is a stem, so that I can slowly write these things. Thanks also, there are some people who are watching and motivating me to write down. In the evening, my friend came to the wrong photo of Ma Dao. It was also a beautiful explosion. Thanks to the Tibetan area, let us experience different beauty.
