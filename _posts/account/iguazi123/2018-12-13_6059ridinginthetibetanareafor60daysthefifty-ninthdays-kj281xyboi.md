<center>http://cnstm.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/2018/12/IMG_6048.jpeg</center> <br/>早晨一起来，大地被大雪覆盖了，白花花的世界。我和林哥去旁边小卖部买了一整板鸡蛋和老北京方便面，准备穿越无人区的食材了。吃完早餐，就开始出发了。幸好的是，路上的雪已经化了，两旁的山全部被大雪覆盖，真是一个童话的世界。出松西村就开始爬坡松西达坂，不过松西村的海拔已达<b>5210</b>米，这应该是我们睡过的最高海拔了。在雪白的苍茫大地上，竟然看见几只藏羚羊，很美，这意境，这现场，很是惊讶，遂赶紧拍照。再向前，快到松西达坂的时候，看见雪地里出现几个大黑点，似狼、似牦牛，停车拍了一副水墨画。很神奇，在如此高寒之地，这么多动物，我们骑着自己的车也成为了漫天雪地里的一副画面。

When we get up in the morning, the earth is covered with heavy snow, the world of white. We went to the side store with Lin and bought a whole plate of eggs and old Beijing instant noodles, ready to cross the ingredients in the no-man's land. After breakfast, We started to leave. Fortunately, the snow on the road has already melted, and the mountains on both sides are covered with heavy snow. It is a fairy tale world. When we live Songxi Village ，we began to climb the slopes of Songxi Datun, but the altitude of Songxi Village has reached 5,210 meters, which should be the highest altitude we have ever slept. On the vast white land, We saw a few Tibetan antelopes, which are beautiful. This artistic conception, this scene, was very surprised. We took pictures quickly. Going forward, when We arrived at Songxi Datun, We saw several big black spots in the snow, like wolves, like yaks, and stopped to take a set of ink paintings. It's amazing. In such a cold place, with so many animals, we are riding our own bycle and it has become a picture in the snow.

浑然天成

到达松西达坂，继续前行，向前没走多远就看到一个非常漂亮的湖泊<b>——</b>龙木错。在如此冰天雪地下，龙木错显得尤为漂亮，层层云朵遮挡住远处的雪山，真想在湖畔过此生。前走不多远，竟然发现龙木错的旁边还有个小湖泊，两个湖泊夹着公路，在这样的地方骑行，一辈子都不会忘记。过了湖泊，就进入一个垭口地带，压根儿看不到远处的路，只有冰冷的雪山，一层层，感觉要翻一座山才能离开这里似的。但，幸运的是，转了几个弯，下了几个坡，竟然出来了。在中午时分，我们到达界山达坂，这里是李聪明横穿羌塘的起点，海拔也达到了5347米。

Arrive at Songxi Datun and continue on. If you don't go far, you will see a very beautiful lake, Longmu. In such a cold and snowy underground, Longmu is particularly beautiful. Layers of clouds cover the snow-capped mountains in the distance. I really want to live this life on the lakeside. Not far before, I found that there is a small lake next to Longmu, and the two lakes are sandwiched by roads. We ride in such places and will never forget it. After crossing the lake, We entered a cornice. We couldn't see the road in the distance. There were only cold snow mountains and layers. We felt like We had to turn over a mountain to get out of here. But, fortunately, after a few turns, a few slopes went out and it came out. At noon, we arrived at the border of Dashan, where Li is smart to cross the Qiangtang, and the altitude reached 5,347 meters.

龙木错

稍作停留，我们继续向前，天上下起了冰雹，都看不到了前方的路。我们沿着下坡，到达山脚下，就来到了死人沟。死人沟有一个检查站，官兵看我们冻的厉害，竟然让我们进屋去烤火，还给我们开水泡面。真的是太感谢了，在这个据说国军和解放军都害怕的小山沟，我们得到了温暖的照顾。跟检查站的朋友聊天，他们很跟我们分享了很多。但，快乐的时光是短暂的，吃完泡面，我们继续赶路。

With a little pause, we continued to move forward, and the sky was up and down, and we could not see the road ahead. We went downhill, reached the foot of the mountain, and came to the dead man's ditch. There is a checkpoint in the dead man's ditch. The officers and men look at our frozen, and let us enter the house to roast the fire, and give us boiled noodles. Thank you very much. In this small ditch, which is said to be afraid of both the National Army and the People's Liberation Army, we have received warm care. Chatting with friends at the checkpoint, they shared a lot with us. However, the happy time is short-lived. After eating instant noodles, we continue on our way.

留个影

死人沟旁边的湖泊

上车就开始爬山，不是很高，也不容易翻越，今天实在翻越的垭口太多了。下山就遇到一个湖泊——红山湖，没做太多停留。再向前走，就是西藏和新疆的分界线了，到今天我们终于骑行完了西藏段。后面的骑行比较安逸，路很平，大片的草原，只是我们不知在何处落脚，我们需要找一块扎营的地方。在傍晚时分，我们看到一处废弃的工地棚，遂过去休息。无人区的第一晚就在这里了，最后竟然发现这里还有个大哥在守卫，这样我们又宽心了不少。折腾的一天，多湖的一天，终于进入到新疆界了。

When I got on the bus, I started climbing. It was not very high, and it was not easy to climb. There are too many mouthwashes that I have crossed today. Down the mountain, I met a lake, Hongshan Lake, and didn't make much stop. Going forward is the dividing line between Tibet and Xinjiang. Today we have finally finished the Tibet section. The rear ride is more comfortable, the road is very flat, and the vast grassland is just that we don't know where to settle. We need to find a place to camp. In the evening, we saw an abandoned construction shed and took a break. The first night of the no-man's land was here, and finally I found out that there is still a big brother guarding here, so we have a lot of relief. A day of tossing, a day in the lake, finally entered the new border.
