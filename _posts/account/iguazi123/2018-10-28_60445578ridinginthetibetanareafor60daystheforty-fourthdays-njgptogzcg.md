昨晚经过惊心的一夜，幸好没有发生什么事情，人还好好的。早晨起来，煮了点方便面，吃了张饼就出发，出发的时候都九点多了。今天太阳不错，风景也好，视野开阔，沿着S206出行，路过了多雄藏布。多雄藏布发起于这一地区，最后与雅鲁藏布江汇集，流入印度洋，没想到我们昨晚睡在河道上，想起来还是很害怕的。
After a shocking night last night, fortunately nothing happened, we are still fine. In the morning, We cooked some instant noodles, and we ate the cake, we set off. It was more than nine o'clock when we left. Today the sun is good, the scenery is good, the view is wide, travel along S206, passing through the many male Tibetan cloth. The Dozen Zangbo originated in this area and finally merged with the Yarlung Zangbo River and flowed into the Indian Ocean. We did not expect that we slept on the river last night, and it was still very scary to think of it.

一错再错，错，在藏区是湖泊的意思，“一错再错”意寓一个湖泊接一个湖泊，也说的是走错一次路，又走错一次

找寻扎日南木措路上的荒野

不一会，又开始呼呼大风，速度又只有每小时5公里左右了，让我们俩恼火的很。林哥着急去往阿里中线，我查看google earth发现一路也确实要浪费不少时间，本来“一错再错”就是我兴起骑行的，今天两人的状态也不好。我们遂慢下脚步，一边走，一边等车看能否捎带我们去往措勤县。不一会，就有一个载满藏族的车子停了下来，司机知道我们的意图之后，啥也没说，就让我们上车。我们于是开启了新藏骑行第一次搭车之旅，后面还有几次，每次也不长，确实时间急迫，其实也有开启搭车之后就有依赖了。
After a while, the wind began to scream again, and the speed was only about 5 kilometers per hour, which made us both very angry. Lin was anxious to go to the Ali midline. I checked google earth and found that we had to waste a lot of time all the time. Originally, “We was mistaken again and wrong", We was riding up. Today,we the two people are in a bad state. We slowed down and walked, waiting for the car to see if we could take us to Coqin County. After a while, there was a car full of Tibetans stopped. After the driver knew our intentions, he did not say anything, let us get on the bus. We then started the first trip of the new Tibetan riding, and there are several times behind it. It is not long every time. It is really time-consuming. In fact, there is dependence after opening the ride.

从google地球上看扎日南木措

今日路线图

一路很荒凉，基本没有村落，海拔由4940米，升至5090米，一翻过一个垭口，就看到一个湖泊，居然没有名字，这么大的湖泊。再往前就到达打加错了，湖面海拔5150米，太美了，可惜没有停下来拍照。这条路我们真该自己骑行走完，应该美的无法形容。一路的湖泊，还有野生动物，还有荒漠的狂野，美丽极了。过完湖泊，没多久就到达一个检查站，我们一车人下车检查，同时去茶馆喝酥油茶，吃老坛酸菜面。和一群藏族同胞在屋子里，沿着墙壁，摆成“回”字的小桌子上午餐，看着藏民用刀子吃干牦牛肉，其实蛮想试一试的。吃完继续前行，经过5578米的最高点，就开始向下走，一路藏族同胞对我们很好，下午很早我们就到达了措勤县，最后司机竟然不要我们的车费。感激之际，也感叹民风的淳朴。
All the way is very desolate, basically no village, the elevation from 4940 meters, rose to 5090 meters, once turned over a pass, you can see a lake, there is no name, such a large lake. Going forward and getting to the wrong, the lake is 5,150 meters above sea level, so beautiful, but unfortunately did not stop to take pictures. After the lake, it didn't take long to reach a checkpoint. We got off the bus and checked it. At the same time, we went to the teahouse to drink butter tea and eat the old altar sour noodles. With a group of Tibetan compatriots in the house, along the wall, put a small table on the "back" word for lunch, watching the Tibetans use a knife to eat dried beef, actually want to try. After eating, I continued to move forward. After the highest point of 5,778 meters, I began to walk down. All the Tibetan compatriots were very good to us. We arrived in Coqin County very early in the afternoon. Finally, the driver did not want our fare. While grateful, I also lamented the simplicity of the folk customs.

汇入扎日南木措的河流，野鸟非常多

找到一个住的地方之后，我们就一起去菜市场买了一些“一错再错”路上所需的物质，一大块干腊肉，一袋干木耳，一板鸡蛋，一袋糌粑，十来小袋北京方便面，还有一些。这一路都无法补给食物，得提前准备好。买完食材，林哥就回去休息了，我一个人去探扎日南木措，折腾了半天，看到了百舸争流和一大群鸟儿，还有好几只野狗，就是没有找到湖泊，最后无功而返。回来了，和林哥找了家好的餐厅吃饭，接下来几天只有吃我们自己携带的了，在出发之前好好招待自己一下。接下来在措勤县转了转，就回去休息了，明日迎接接下来的挑战。
After finding a place to live, we went to the market to buy some of the materials needed on the road, "a wrong and wrong" road, a large piece of dried bacon, a bag of dried fungus, a plate of eggs, a bag of eggs, ten Small bags of instant noodles in Beijing, and some. This road is unable to replenish food and must be prepared in advance. After buying the ingredients, Lin Ge went back to rest. I went alone to explore Nik Nammu, and for a long time, I saw a hundred miles of battle and a large group of birds, and there were several wild dogs, that is, I did not find the lake. Finally, Nothing to return. When I came back, I went to a good restaurant with Lin Ge. I only had to take it with me in the next few days. I would like to entertain myself before I set off. Next, I turned around in Coqin County and went back to rest. I will meet the next challenge tomorrow.
