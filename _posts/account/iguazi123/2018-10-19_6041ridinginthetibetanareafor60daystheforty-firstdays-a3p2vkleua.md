早上起来整理帐篷的时候，看见昨晚的明月还在，只是被太阳遮住了光辉。一个驮包、两个睡袋、一个帐篷，还有吃的等等，装的满满当当的。吃了点东西，又开始出发。出发时分，湖边早就集聚了一群牦牛，似赶场一样。沿着湖边骑行，那叫一个爽，一边骑行一边回忆昨天转湖的点滴。
When I got up and arranged the tent in the morning, I saw that the bright moon was still there in the sky, but its Glorious was covered by the sun. A Riding bag, two sleeping bags, a tent, and food, etc., are full of clothes. After eating breakfest, We started to ride again. At the time of departure, the lake had already gathered a group of yaks, just like jumping in the field. Riding along the lake, it is cool, while riding, while recalling the bit of the lake turned yesterday.

纯净的湖泊，自由的野鸟

过了湖泊，再骑行了几个小时就到了昂拉山垭口，海拔不高，挂满了经幡。垭口有两只小狗，很是可爱，林大哥抱着它拍了一会照片。我和林大哥边休息边等着大部队，林的巴基斯坦签证快到期了，和我商议是否要加快速度，分队去往叶城。刚过垭口，我们被湛蓝的天惊呆了，赶紧拿出相机来拍摄。朵朵白云，散布在天空中，就像是上帝放的山羊，煞是好看，与这藏地的地形，绝配了。
After crossing the lake, We rode to the Angola Mountain Pass for a few hours. The altitude was not high and it was full of prayer flags. There are two puppies in the mouth, it is very cute, and Lin play with it for a while. I stayed with Lin and waited for the big troops. Lin’s Pakistan visa expired soon. We discussed whether I should speed up and squadrons go to Yecheng. Just after the pass, we were shocked by the blue sky, and quickly took out the camera to shoot. The blossoming white clouds are scattered in the sky. It is beautiful, and it is perfect with the terrain of this Tibetan land.

朵朵白云

我们很快就到卡嘎镇，午餐就在这解决了。齐大哥昨晚睡的不好，早起有点感冒，遂提议在旁边的昂仁县城休息一下。齐大哥带着小六一确实将我们的速度降了下来，林大哥于是和大家商议我们要不分队前行，他的签证确实急的很。我们俩一起在拉萨签的边防通行证，为了节约还签在同一张上，只有一起做先锋队了。很遗憾这么快就要和大家分开，我们于是决定在旁边的县城好吃一顿，庆祝我们这段时间的同行，也为我和林送行。
We soon arrived in the town of Cathy, and the lunch was settled here. Qi brother didn't sleep well last night. He got a little cold early, and he proposed to take a rest in the nearby Anren County. It’s inconvenient for Qi to take the small six one. Lin then discussed with us that we have to separate for two team. His visa is really urgent. I and he together signed the border defense pass in Lhasa. In order to save and sign one paper, we will become the vanguard team. It is a pity that we will be separated from everyone so soon. We decided to have a good meal in the nearby county town, to celebrate our peers during this time, and to send off for me and Lin.

昨晚捕获的冷水鱼

沙师弟

卡嘎镇右转七公里就到达了昂仁县城，买菜做饭，还有昨晚捕的鱼，好不热闹。新藏线少有的大餐，我们七个人的火锅，还喝了点小酒，吃的满足极了。吃饱之后，到处耍了一会，洗了个澡，就开始休息。明天就要分开了，虽然只有短短十天时间，一路走过来，兄弟情谊已刻在心底，不免有点伤感。对于我们，也许是最后一晚在一块，旅行中遇见就是缘分，感谢大家。不说了，明儿再续吧。
Kayan Town turned right seven kilometers to reach the city of Angren County, buy food and cook, we also have fish caughted last night, so lively. The rare meal of the road of ride to Xinjiang , the hot pot of our seven people, also drank a little wine, the satisfaction of eating is extremely good. After eating, We played around for a while, took a shower and started to rest. To be separated tomorrow, although only a short period of ten days, all the way to come, brotherhood has been engraved in my heart, this time feel a little sad. For us, maybe the last night in a piece, it is fate to meet during the trip, thank you. Do not say, Continue tomorrow.

昂仁县旁被污染的湖泊，了无生机
