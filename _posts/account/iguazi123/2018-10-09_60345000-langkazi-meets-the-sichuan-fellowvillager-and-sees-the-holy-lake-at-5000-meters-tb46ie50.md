今天天气不好，但我们的运气不错。早晨一起来，就被废弃房屋的主人给找上了，据说是这所学校的负责人，一顿藏语七说八说，好不容易明白意思了，想罚我们前。最后闹得村长都过来了，经过一顿交涉，最后被罚款一百元。处理完我们就开始出发，前面基本沿着羊湖骑行，风景还是巴适，真想在这个地方住下来。
The weather is bad today, but our luck is good. When I got up in the morning, I was found by the owner of the abandoned house. It is said to be the person in charge of the school. He said that we must pay for him. In the end, the village chief came over. After a negotiation, We were fined a hundred yuan. After we finished processing, we started to go, basically riding along the Yam Zhuo lake in front, the scenery is still beautiful, I really want to live in this place.

去了就不想走的地方

中午我们顺利骑行到浪卡子县，找了个老乡的餐厅吃饭，还是川菜，终于不用自己煮面条了。老板看我们骑行的，尤其看到齐大哥带着小六一环中国，对我们格外热情。吃完饭，说要带我们去一个特别漂亮的地方去看，据说是班禅大师的观相圣湖。我们一听，蛮有意思的，就随着老板开车出发了。那个湖泊离不丹比较近，需要特别的证明，幸亏老板在当地比较熟，不过安检和边防证查的很严。我们来回一百多公里，终于看到那么美丽的景色。那个湖泊海拔5000米+，车爬到一个垭口，刚到垭口就看到了湖泊，着实让我们惊讶。遗憾的是到达垭口，天气不是很好，乌云密布，风很大，湖水像海水一样拍打着湖岸，也别有一番风味。据说那个湖泊中间有个小岛，冬天结冰，冬天当地藏民会赶着羊去湖心岛上吃草，过了一个月等冰雪消融之前，再把羊群赶回来。尤其的是，冬天结冰的时候，超级漂亮，好多情侣都会去那儿拍结婚照。老乡说，神山那边还有个冰川——40号冰川，异常漂亮，普通人很难找到，那只能以后有机会去了。
At noon, we smoothly rode to Langkazi County, found a restaurant in the village, and finally we did not need to cook the noodles ourselves. The boss saw us riding, especially when he saw Qi Da’s small six-one ring China, and was very enthusiastic about us. After dinner, He said that him should take us to a particularly beautiful place to see, it is said that the Panchen Lama is watching the holy lake. When we heard it, it was quite interesting, just as the boss drove off. The lake is relatively close to Bhutan and requires special proof. Fortunately, the boss is familiar in the local area, but the security and border inspections are very strict. We went back and forth more than 100 kilometers and finally saw such a beautiful view. The lake is 5,000 meters above sea level, the car climbed to a cornice, and just saw the lake at the mouth of the mouth, which really surprised us. Unfortunately, when we arrive at the pass, the weather is not very good, the clouds are dense, the wind is very strong, and the lake is like a sea of ​​water, and you don’t have a flavor. It is said that there is a small island in the middle of the lake. It freezes in winter. In the winter, local Tibetans will drive the sheep to the island to graze. After a month of ice and snow melting, the sheep will be returned. In particular, when it is frozen in winter, it is super beautiful, and many couples will go there to take wedding photos. The fellow said that there is a glacier on the other side of the mountain - the No. 40 glacier, which is very beautiful. It is difficult for ordinary people to find it. It can only be given in the future.

普姆雍措，海拔5010米

那个湖泊就是普姆雍措，普姆在藏语中是“少女”的意思，所以又名“少女湖”，她海拔5010米，面积295平方公里，湖边有雪山围绕着的神山库拉冈日山守护。湖边有着世界上海拔最高的村庄推村，而我们也称其为中国最后的神秘村落之一。天上的圣湖坠入人间，隐秘的村落是圣湖最长情的陪伴，说的就是这里，《第三极》中宏大的赶羊场景也是在这里拍摄的。历据村庄存在的原因是，一千多年前有位活佛在这里修炼，逐渐，他有了很多的追随者，人们在寺庙周围形成了的聚居地，也就是现在村落的前身。传说中的寺庙仍然伫立于普姆雍错之畔，像一个守护者一样，守护着推村的人畜。神山圣湖贡巴，这也许是藏区最独特的风景了。
The lake is Pumu Chongcuo. Pum is the meaning of "girl" in Tibetan, so it is also known as "Girl Lake". She is 5010 meters above sea level and covers an area of ​​295 square kilometers. The lake is surrounded by snow-capped mountains. Rishan guardian. The lake has the village of the highest elevation in the world, and we call it one of the last mysterious villages in China. The holy lake in the sky falls into the world, and the hidden village is the longest companionship of the holy lake. It is here that the grand scene of the sheep in the Third Pole is also filmed here. According to the reason of the existence of the village, there was a living Buddha who practiced here more than a thousand years ago. Gradually, he had many followers, and people formed a settlement around the temple, which is the predecessor of the current village. The legendary temple still stands on the bank of Pum, and like a guardian, guards the people and animals of the village. The holy mountain of Gonba, this is perhaps the most unique scenery in the Tibetan area.
