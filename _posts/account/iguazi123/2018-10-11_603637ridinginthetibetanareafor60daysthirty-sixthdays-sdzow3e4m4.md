<center>http://cnstm.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/英雄纪念碑.jpg</center> <br/>今天的目的地是日喀则——西藏第二大城市，听齐大哥说日喀则有一群骑行的朋友想和我们聚一聚，给我们接风洗尘。日喀则的骑友据说会在路中间等待我们，然后带着我们骑进日喀则城区。在地图上一看，江孜距离日喀则也不远，我和林大哥商议先去参观江孜宗山抗英遗址，缅怀一下清朝时保卫西藏的战士，齐大哥就先带着六一向前出发。

Today's destination is Shigatse, the second largest city in Tibet. I heard that Big Brother said that a group of friends who are riding in Shigat want to gather with us and entertain us. The riders in Shigatse are said to be waiting for us in the middle of the road, then take us into the city of Shigatse. On the map, Jiangyan is not far from Shigatse. I discussed with Lin to visit the Jiangzong Zongshan Anti-British Site and remember the soldiers who defended Tibet during the Qing Dynasty.

江孜宗山抗英遗址位于县城宗山上的宗堡（江孜古堡），历史上清光绪年英军由亚东入侵西藏，1904年推进到江孜，向宗山猛烈进攻，最后军民坚守阵地达3个月，最后弹尽援绝，宗山失守。遗址挺破旧的，沿山而建，有炮台、跳崖台、驻藏大臣巡边石碑、政府议事厅，还有法王殿，蛮具有教育意义的。江孜县还有一座白居寺，一座藏传佛教萨迦派、夏鲁派、格鲁派共建的寺院，也是可以去瞧一瞧的。

Jiangzong Zongshan Anti-British Site is located in Zongbao (Jiangxi Ancient Fortress) on the Zongshan Mountain of the county. In the history of the Qing Dynasty, the British army invaded Tibet from Yadong. In 1904, it advanced to Jiangyan and attacked Zongshan fiercely. Finally, the soldiers and civilians held their positions. In the end of the month, Zong Shan fell. The site is quite old and built along the mountain. There are forts, jumping cliffs, patrolling stone monuments, government councils, and the Fawang Hall. It is quite educational. There is also a Baiju Temple in Jiangyan County, a temple built by the Tibetan Buddhist Sakya, the Xialu, and the Gelug Sect.

参观完宗山遗址，我们也冲冲出发了。今天的太阳有点毒辣，太阳照在大地上，翻起滚滚热浪。一路的村民在劳作，整个大地也是相当干旱，不过藏民的牦牛、骡马齐上阵，耕种场面也是非常壮观。被日喀则的骑友一路相迎，一起在天临大酒店落脚，洗了个痛痛快快的澡，舒服极了。藏区很少有机会洗澡，一个是水资源匮乏，二个是藏区洗澡着凉后容易生病。晚上跟骑友、酒店的骑行爱好者一起吃了个饭，感谢日喀则的朋友对我们的招待。第二天，我们趁势就休息了一天，也等等小六一的拖车，我也买了一个睡袋，以安然在零下十来度的夜晚搭帐篷睡觉。

After visiting the Zongshan site, we also set off. Today's sun is a bit sinister, the sun shines on the ground, and the hot waves are rolled up. The villagers all the way are working, and the whole land is quite dry. However, the Tibetan yak and the squatting horses are on the scene, and the farming scene is also very spectacular. I was greeted by the riders of Shigatse all the way, and settled in the Tianlin Hotel together, and took a bath that was sore and soothing. It was very comfortable. There is very little opportunity for bathing in Tibetan areas. One is lack of water resources, and the other is that the Tibetan area is prone to illness after taking a shower. In the evening, I had a meal with the riders and the hotel’s cycling enthusiasts, thanking the friends of Shigatse for their hospitality. The next day, we took a rest for a day, and waited for the small six-one trailer. I also bought a sleeping bag to sleep on the night below zero.
