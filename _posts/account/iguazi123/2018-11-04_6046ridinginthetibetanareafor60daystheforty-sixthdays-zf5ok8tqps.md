早上一起来，在藏民家泡了碗方便面，还买了藏民家的北京方便面。北京方便面是我们骑行中的最爱，在这么遥远的藏区还能常常看见老北京方便面，真是大爱。出发就沿着一个湖泊前行，这个湖泊已经缩小很多了。湖的尽头走完，就开始翻垭口，这个垭口很矮，比较好翻越，我们轻松不小。阿里骑行，或者藏区骑行，不像川藏骑行，一下子3000，一下子5000，阿里更多的是4500-5300之间，海拔虽然高了一些，但不翻垭口还是很爽的。

In the morning, We brought a bowl of instant noodles in the Tibetan home and bought the Beijing instant noodles of the Tibetans. Beijing instant noodles are the favorite of our riding. In such a far-flung Tibetan area, we can often see the old Beijing instant noodles. It is a great. Starting along a lake, the lake has shrunk a lot. At the end of the lake, We began to turn over the mouth. This mouth is very short, it is better to climb over. Ali riding, or riding in the Tibetan area, unlike the Sichuan-Tibet riding, all of a sudden 3000, a sudden 5000, Ali is more between 4500-5300, although the altitude is higher, but it is still very cool.

这路，醉了

一图见今天的狼狈

过垭口，开始下山，这里就走错路了，幸好没有走远。下到底，一个小河谷，风景挺美的，只是林哥的车胎又给扎了。这一路，老扎心了，林哥的车胎总是扎胎，他的旅行车备胎又少，我们很是担心。到达一个桥的地方，我们坐下来吃午餐，主要是鸡蛋和北京方便面。今天吃的鸡蛋够多的了，一个人一顿两个，刚到中午，我们两个就干掉了8个鸡蛋。吃完继续前行，再往前走就可以看见旁边的塔若错，此行中最大的一个湖泊了。遗憾的是，在路上只能看到一点点，湖泊离路太远，只能下次再来了。

After crossing the mouth, We started to go down the mountain. We took the wrong road here, but fortunately We did not go far. In the end, a small river valley, the scenery is quite beautiful, but Lin’s tires are tied again. Lin Ge's tires are always tied, his travel car spare tires are few, we are very worried. When we arrived at a bridge, we sat down for lunch, mainly eggs and Beijing instant noodles. There are enough eggs to eat today. One person has two meals. Just arrived at noon, and we both eat 8 eggs. After finish eating, we go ahead and you can see the next tower, the biggest lake in the trip. Unfortunately, only a little bit can be seen on the road. The lake is too far away from the road and can only come again next time.

这一片草地，太美了

奔驰的藏野驴

刚转过一个山头，就看到一大片草原，草原上好多动物，成群的藏野驴在奔跑，实在太美了。真想就在附近定居，天天泡在这大自然的恩赐中。突然，前面出现几个骑摩托车的朋友，当然的，少不了拍照、合影，还有各种问题了。他们在这路上骑摩托车也是不容易，尤其在沙地，陷进去之后就很难出来。他们也给我们带来了一个坏消息，前方乌云密布，暴风雪可能将至，让我们尽快一点。我们自然是加快脚步，顶着乌云前行，想在暴风雪来临之前到达目的地。但，还是晚了一步，还远远没看到目的地，就遇到暴雪了。太大了，漫天的雪，一会儿车上就积满了雪，更加不可能前行了。四周也没有啥遮蔽物，能见度超级低，我们想，这下完蛋了，不晓得暴雪会持续多久。如果一直这样，留给我们的只有失温，然后就不敢想象了。幸运的是，暴雪下了半个多小时竟然停止了，天一下子转好，这翻脸的速度，服了。

Just turned a hill, I saw a large grassland, a lot of animals on the grassland, and a group of Tibetan wild ass running, it is so beautiful. I really want to settle down nearby, soaking in the gift of nature every day. Suddenly, there were a few friends riding motorcycles in front of them. Of course, there were indispensable photos, photos, and asked various problems. It is not easy for them to ride a motorcycle on this road, especially in the sand, it is very difficult to come out after being trapped. They also brought us a bad news, the clouds in front, the blizzard may come, let us as soon as possible. We naturally speed up our pace, marching ahead with the clouds, and want to reach our destination before the storm. However, it was still a step late, and it was far from seeing the destination, and it was Blizzard. It’s too big, the snow in the sky, and the bike is full of snow in a while, and it’s even more impossible to move forward. There are no obstructions around, and the visibility is extremely low. We think that this is finished, and we don’t know how long Blizzard will last. If this is the case, the only thing left for us is the temperature loss, and then we can’t imagine it. Fortunately, Blizzard stopped for more than half an hour, and the day turned better.

骑向风暴

这天气真好，谁都不会想到一场暴风雪刚过去

晚上近十点才到达帕江乡，看到炊烟寥寥我们太兴奋了，今晚终于可以不睡野地了。到达的时候，恰好逢小学下晚自习，一群孩子，围着我们俩，像看外星人似的，估摸着有百来个吧。我们走一步，他们就走一步，拉着我们的车看，简直了。还不让我们走，不知道想干啥。还好旁边有个提供住宿的旅馆，老板把他们呵斥走了。我们开始准备晚餐，收拾房间，时不时还是有小孩过来。晚上睡觉的时候，只听到整片山的野狗叫声，这地方，今天也是经历丰富。

At about 10 o'clock in the evening, We arrived at Pajiang Township. We were so excited to see the smoke. We can’t sleep in the wild tonight. When We arrived, A group of children surrounded follow us, looked like aliens, and estimated that there were hundreds of them. We took a step and they took a step and took our bike to see it. Fortunately, there is a hotel next to the accommodation, the boss scolded them away. We started preparing dinner and cleaning up the room, and there were still children coming from time to time. When We slept at night, We only heard the sound of wild dogs in the whole mountain. This place is also full of trouble today.
