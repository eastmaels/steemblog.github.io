从日喀则出发的那天是2016年5月21日，恰好是藏历四月十五日，是西藏的萨噶达瓦节，那天扎寺伦布寺人很多，大街上堵的很，我们还是出发了。和日喀则骑友合影留念、短暂告别之后，我们就匆匆上路了。今天我们多了一个队友，以前在G318上徒步的兄弟，决定骑行加入我们，队伍也越来越庞大。我们今天一天都在赶路，骑行还算顺利。下午天气很热，中间发现一条小溪，我们一起下去玩了一哈，抓了一些小鱼。在河里玩了不大一会，天气大变，突然狂风暴雨，只能到路上的涵洞去避雨顺便吃个午餐。

Today is May 21, 2016, which happened to be the April 15th of the Tibetan calendar，It was the Sakyatawa Festival in Tibet. There were many people at the Temple of Lumbhu Temple on that day. The street was very blocked，We still set off。After a photo with the riders of Shigatse and a short farewell, we hurried on the road. Today we have a teammate. The brothers who used to walk on the G318 decided to ride us and the team is getting bigger and bigger. We are on the road today, and the ride is smooth. The weather was very hot in the afternoon, and a small stream was found in the middle. We went down together and caught some small fish. After playing in the river for a little while, the weather changed greatly, and suddenly there was a storm, we can only go to the culvert on the road to avoid the rain and have a lunch.

骑行中间发现了一个重要的里程碑，G318国道，从上海人民广场到西藏拉孜，中国最美景观大道，5000公里纪念。我们在里程碑附近一通拍照，也去路程碑那里拍照，路程碑离醒目的里程碑还有一点点距离。这些都只是一个标签，其实究竟那个是真正的5000公里也是不能深入考究的。晚上很晚才找到一个还算可以的居住地方，明明攻略显示的83公里就到了，可是直到100多公里才找到，太坑爹。天气也是不好，幸好到了住所雨才下大，也算对我们的安慰。

An important milestone was found in the middle of the ride. The G318 National Road, from Shanghai People's Square to Tibet Lahu, China's most beautiful landscape avenue, 5,000 km commemoration. We took photos around the milestones and took photos of the monuments. The milestone was a little further away from the eye-catching milestones. It was late in the evening to find a place to live in. It was obvious that the 83 kilometers of the Raiders had arrived, but it was not found until more than 100 kilometers. The weather is also not good, but fortunately, the rain falls until our arrival, it is a comfort to us.

今天还是住在藏民的房子里，和藏民一起喝酥油茶、各自泡了碗方便面，填补饥饿的肚子。等弄完都比较晚了，我们也各自回住所开始休息，明日就要离开G318了，好好休息吧。

Today, I still live in a Tibetan house, drinking butter tea with Tibetans, and soaking instant noodles in bowls to fill the hungry stomach.We also go back to our residence and start to rest. We will leave G318 tomorrow, so rest well.
