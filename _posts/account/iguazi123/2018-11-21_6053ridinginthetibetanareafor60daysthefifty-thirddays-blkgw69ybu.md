<center>http://cnstm.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/2018/11/IMG_5704-1.jpg</center> <br/><p class="p1">早上真不想起来，前一晚转山太累了，可是时间很急，不得不再次出发。我们走小道离开塔钦的，再回眼望一望冈仁波齐。今天我们的计划是搭车到达巴尔兵站，然后去往扎达，看扎达土林，还有瞻仰古格王朝。</p>
<p class="p2">We really didn't want to get up in the morning. It was too tired to turn the mountain the night before, but the time was very urgent and We had to start again. We left Tachin on the trail and looked back at Gang Rinpoche. Today our plan is to take a bus to the Balbine station, then to Zada, to see Zada ​​Tulin, and to see the Guge Dynasty.</p>

回望冈仁波齐

喜欢这座雪顶
<p class="p1">搭车路上不多说，反正波折反复。到达巴尔兵站之后，我们找到一家藏茶馆，然后把车子寄存在哪里，就继续搭车去往扎达，好不容易搭上车。巴尔兵站去往扎达的路上景色非常棒，我们还看到了好几只岩羊，不过一路上也是危险重重，垭口的海拔也很高。以后再来骑行一圈吧！扎达一过去就是喜马拉雅山脉雪山群，土林林立面前，远方是成群的雪山，这景致也是绝了。但我们只顾着赶路，也没拍啥好的照片，另外手机也就这样，确实也拍不出来。</p>
<p class="p2">Not much to say on the road, anyway, repeated twists and turns. After arriving at the Balbine Station, we found a tea house, and then parked the car where it was, then continued to take a ride to Zada, and finally got the bus. The scenery of the Balber station to Zada ​​is very good. We also saw several rock sheep, but it is also dangerous along the way, and the altitude of the mouth is also very high. Zada is a group of snow-capped mountains in the Himalayas. In front of the forest, the mountains are in the distance, and the scenery is absolutely perfect. But we only care about the road, did not take good pictures, and the mobile phone is like this, it really can't be shot.</p>

纳木那尼雪山
<p class="p1">到达扎达县城已经是傍晚了，找了一下住宿，没有找到合适的。我们两个在扎达县城吃了顿川菜，然后就准备找车去古格王朝遗址，不过一直没有车。于是，靠脚走喽，一路上也在看是否有去往古格王朝的车。走了大概三分之一，遇见了一个大哥，他在中间的一个单位上班，好心地搭了我们一程。下车后，我们继续走路，到达遗址旁边的一个村天都黑了。在村民的帮助下，找到一个住的地方，像一座小学。当晚，也是很早就休息了</p>
<p class="p2">It was already late in the evening to reach Zada ​​County. I found a place to stay and did not find a suitable one. The two of us ate the Sichuan cuisine in Zada ​​County, and then we were ready to find a car to go to the Guge Dynasty site, but there was no car. So, walking on the foot, along the way is also to see if there is a car to go to the Guge Dynasty. After walking about a third, I met a big brother. He went to work in a middle unit and took a good trip. After getting off the bus, we continued to walk, and the village next to the ruins was dark. With the help of the villagers, find a place to live, like a primary school. That night, I also took a break early.</p>
