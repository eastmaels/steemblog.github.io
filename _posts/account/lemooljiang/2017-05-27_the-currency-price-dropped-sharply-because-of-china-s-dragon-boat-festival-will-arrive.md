The currency price dropped sharply because of the Dragon Boat festival! Last night, the price of the coin went down without any conditions, without exception, until today! Bitcoin fell nearly 20% more than the other, the currency was worse, close to 50%, such as bitshares, directly halfcut! Steem also fell sharply, almost 40%.
币价大跌，只因到了端午节啊！昨晚币价在毫无特殊情况的条件下无条件地下跌，一直持续到今天！比特币下跌了近20%多，其它的币下跌得更狠，有接近50%多的，比如比特股，直接腰斩！steem也跌得狠，快40%了。

I think a lot of people are looking for reasons now. I think, in fact, the ressons is simple, that is, Chinese are selling their bitcoins! Becaust of Dragon Boat Festival, people need some money! So you can imaging, Chinese  strength is great, just let some coin currency price fell. Therefore, China's festival will be changed to currency price.
我想现在有很多人都在找原因了。砖家还没出台意见前，我想其实也简单，就是中国的币民在提现呗！这又有什么难分析，马上端午节了，提点钱过节了！所以可以想像，国人的力量还是很大的，随便提点币就让币价大跌。所以以后中国的节日都要改为币价记念日才对啊。
