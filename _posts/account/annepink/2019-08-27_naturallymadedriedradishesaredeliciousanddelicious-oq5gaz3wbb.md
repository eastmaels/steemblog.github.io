大白萝卜是我们每个人都吃过的！萝卜干相信大家也都吃过哈~~ 今天我要给大家介绍，我做的非常好吃的萝卜干😋

首先来了解下大白萝卜

白萝卜是天然蔬菜，它里面含有丰富的维生素和营养成分，而这些营养和维生素也都是我们人体所需的，所以经常吃白萝卜会增强人体的免疫力和抵抗力

The great white radish is something we've all eaten! Dried turnip believe everyone had ha ~ ~ I want to introduce you to today, I do very delicious of dried turnip 😋

Let's start with the white radish

White radish is a natural vegetable, it contains rich vitamins and nutrients, and these nutrients and vitamins are also needed by our human body, so often eat white radish will enhance the immunity and resistance of the human body

白萝卜还有降低血糖的功效，即使是糖尿病患者也可以适量吃些白萝卜，这样对病情还很有益呢！我爸爸就有糖尿病，我看见他蛮喜欢吃的~~ 他也是这样说的，可以降血糖！而且白萝卜还有很高的药用价值呢，如有条件的话，每天食些白萝卜可以缓解腹胀，对头痛的人也有帮助~~ 所以食白萝卜不仅是美味享受，还能对我们的身体有大帮助噢

然后再来讲讲萝卜干~~ 萝卜干就是大白萝卜制作而成的，我家乡下亲戚在老家晒了好多萝卜干，因为乡下有田地，种植的白萝卜没吃完的，可以在大太阳下晒干来，就成了干萝卜

White turnip still has the effect that reduces blood sugar, even diabetic patient also can eat a few white turnip right amount, still very beneficial to the condition so! My father has diabetes, I see he likes to eat ~~ he also said so, can reduce blood sugar! And the white radish has very high medicinal value, if there is a condition, eat some white radish every day can alleviate abdominal distention, have help to the person that has a headache ~~ so eat white radish is not only delicious to enjoy, still can have big help to our body

Then I will talk about dried radish ~~ dried radish is made of white radish. My relatives in the countryside dried a lot of radish in their hometown, because there were fields in the countryside, and the white radish they planted could be dried in the sun, so it became dried radish

上面图片中有晒干的萝卜干，都是我妈在乡下带来给我的，我就把它炒好了一大份，装在玻璃罐里，放进冰箱冷藏保鲜，随时吃再拿出来吃就可以了，特别的方便👍

吃饭的时候来点萝卜干很好下饭噢😋 就是因为它很好下饭，所以受到大众人们的欢迎，不过，很多人吃萝卜干大概都是在外面买的，可能很少在家自己做，因为外面买比较快捷方便嘛

下面我来给大家说下我的萝卜干的做法

In the picture above have dried dried turnip, is my mother in the countryside brought to me, I will give it good Fried a large, in a glass jar, refrigerated fresh in the refrigerator, it is ok to eat out again at any time, particularly convenient 👍

When you eat something to orders dried turnip is very good oh 😋 orders is because it is very good, so was welcomed by the mass people, however, many people eat dried turnip is bought outside, probably may have little yourself at home, because outside buy more convenient

Now let me tell you about my dried radish

- 首先要把萝卜干洗干净，我家亲戚晒得萝卜干比外面的干净，而且是天然晒制，零添加的，清洗也比较方便

- 洗干净以后，拧干水分，一定要拧干水分，炒制起来才香浓好吃哈~ 再把萝卜干都切成条状，再切成很细小块或沫状也可以

- 切好蒜末、小米椒备用

- 热锅中倒入适量菜油(一定要用天然菜油炒才好吃喔！)，锅内油温适宜后，将事先切好的蒜末和小米椒倒入锅内爆香下，再萝卜干倒进翻炒，差不多油炸炒干一会儿，加入适量的料酒或白酒增香，保证新鲜口感！

- 然后再加入食盐、生抽、天然五香粉或香辣粉，这里温馨提示下: 如果不喜欢太辣口味，也可以少加香辣粉或小米椒

- 炒制均匀入味后，就可以出锅装盘了(喜欢加耗油的也可以出锅前，适量加点)

做法很简单吧😄 特别香浓好吃呢！放凉后可以装进密封罐中，放进冰箱冷藏保存好

主要是自己做的萝卜干美味又卫生，还很下饭！不管是老人小孩还是大人都喜欢啊，保证你的萝卜干一上桌就被抢吃一空噢！🤭

不过萝卜干虽好吃，也不能太贪嘴了，适量食用哈，因为多吃就不易啦！

- first of all to clean the radish dry cleaning, my relatives drying radish than outside clean, and is naturally dried, zero add, cleaning is more convenient

- after washing, wring out the water, be sure to wring out the water, fry up to taste delicious ~ and then cut radish dried into strips, and then cut into very small pieces or foam

- cut minced garlic, millet pepper set aside

- pour the right amount of vegetable oil into the hot wok (make sure to saute with natural vegetable oil to taste good!). , the oil temperature in the pot is appropriate, will be cut into the garlic and millet pepper into the pot, then dry radish into stir fry, almost fry dry for a while, add the right amount of cooking wine or liquor flavor, ensure fresh taste!

- then add salt, light soy sauce, natural five-spice powder or spicy powder. Here's a warm reminder: if you don't like too spicy taste, you can add less spicy powder or millet pepper

- after the stir-fry is evenly flavored, it can be put on the pan and put on the plate (if you like to add oil, you can add some before the pan).

It very simple 😄 special fragrant delicious! Cool and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator

Mainly do their own radish dried delicious and sanitary, but also very delicious! Whether it is old, children or adults like ah, make sure your dried radish on the table will be robbed of all oh! 🤭

However, radish dry although delicious, also can not be too greedy, right amount of food ha, because it is not easy to eat more!
