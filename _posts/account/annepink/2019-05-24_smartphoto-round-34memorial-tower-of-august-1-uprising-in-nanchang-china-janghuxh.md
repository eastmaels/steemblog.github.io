这里是中国南昌的新八一广场!🌠
每当夜幕降临时，八一广场璀璨的夜景令人陶醉啊!!🌠但最令人瞩目的是八一广场上的八一起义纪念塔!!🌟

‘‘八一”是代表我们南昌的名词，在南昌英雄城的每处角落都可以寻找到八一元素，但最具代表八一精神的建筑，就是这尊更像碑的八一南昌起义纪念塔🌟

据历史记载约1977年建成至今!八一南昌起义纪念塔已成为我们南昌这座城市的象征!🌟
纪念塔的正北面是由中国历史性大人物叶剑英元帅题写的‘‘八一南昌起义纪念塔’’九个铜胎鎏金大字，八一南昌起义纪念塔下面嵌刻了‘‘八一南昌起义简介’’花岗石碑，其它三面是‘‘宣布起义’’、‘‘攻打敌营’’、‘‘欢呼胜利’’三幅大型花岗石浮雕筑，塔身两侧各有一牌翼墙，嵌有中国工农红军旗徽浮雕!!塔顶则由直立的花岗石雕步枪和红色花岗石拼贴的中国人民解放军军旗组成!!(由于观赏的人太多...近拍较困难，在这就文字简单介绍下了)

整个纪念塔造型威武!!霸气!!雄伟挺拔!!寓意深刻...上下分别设置的多层灯光和多组投射灯，使夜间塔身显得特别通透明亮🌟并昭示着人们八一军旗永远的鲜红亮丽💫💫💫

This is New Bayi Square in Nanchang, China!🌠
When night falls, the dazzling night view of Bayi Square is intoxicating.  ! 🌠 But the most striking thing is the Bayi Uprising Memorial Tower in Bayi Square!  !🌟

"Bayi" is a noun representing Nanchang. The Bayi element can be found in every corner of Nanchang Hero City, but the most representative building of Bayi spirit is the Bayi Nanchang Uprising Memorial Tower, which is more like a monument.🌟

According to historical records, it has been completed since about 1977.  August 1 Nanchang Uprising Memorial Tower has become a symbol of our Nanchang city!🌟
Just north of the monument is the "August 1st Nanchang Uprising Monument" inscribed by Marshal Ye Jianying, a historic figure in China. Nine large bronze-gilded characters are inscribed on the monument. The next August 1st Nanchang Uprising Monument is inscribed with the granite monument "Introduction to August 1st Nanchang Uprising". The other three sides are inscribed with three large granite reliefs: "Announcing Uprising", "Attacking Enemy Camp" and "Hailing Victory". On both sides of the tower are a plate of wing wall embedded with relief relief of the flag emblem of the Chinese Red Army of Workers and Peasants surrounded by pine and evergreen.  !  The top of the tower consists of an upright granite carving rifle and a Chinese People's Liberation Army military flag collaged with red granite.  !  (As there are too many people watching ... it is difficult to take a close shot, let's briefly introduce the text here.)

The whole monument looks awesome!  !  Aggressive!  !  Magnificent and straight!  !  The implication is profound ... several layers of lights and several groups of projection lights are respectively arranged on top and bottom, which make the tower body appear particularly transparent and bright at night and show people the eternal bright red and bright of Bayi military flag.💫💫💫
