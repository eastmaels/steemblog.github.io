我的爸爸隔三差五就会做些包子 ... 弟弟妹妹和我~ 每次我拿的是最多的一个 ~~ 嘿嘿 ~ 因为爸爸做的包子实在系太好吃了^ω^ 基本每次都有三种口味哒 ... 盐菜包 ~ 鲜肉包 ~ 还一种有可能是花卷或是无糖馒头 ~~  味道都很赞😋

我爸爸弄菜的厨艺也非常好 ~ 虽说同妈妈的技艺比起来不分上下 ... 但妈妈做的面食要稍逊一筹 ...面食是爸爸哒一绝👍

My dad will do some buns every other time... Brother and sister~ Every time I take the most one~~ 😁 Because the buns made by Dad are really delicious ^ω^ Basically there are three kinds each time. Taste... Salted vegetables ~ Fresh meat ~ Also a kind of flower roll or sugar-free taro ~~

My father's cooking skills are also very good ~ Although it is not the same as the mother's skills... But my mother's pasta is a bit worse... Pasta is a must for my father.

我在旁边看见爸爸勺了大半瓷盆面粉 ...然后加水 ...加酵母粉 ... 然后再使劲儿细细的揉 ... 揉好了放在一边 ~ 洗手后又拿砧板放在桌子上 ... 再将洗好的肉和炒熟的盐菜放在各个小碗里，还有一大早妈妈去菜园拔回来已经洗净的小葱一一拿过来 ~ 爸爸先将肉切成一坨坨的 ... 再切成块状 ... 再切成丝… 然后一起剁成些沫堆堆 ...加各种调味料拌匀 ~~ 在一边看的我感觉自己都偷学到手了...哈哈

妈妈看我一副馋猫的样子 ... 都偷乐啦~😂

现在早上的早餐我和熊孩纸都能吃到爸爸做的包子特幸福啊💓 ~~~  一碗杂粮粥几个包子吃的我撑到扶墙都笑呵呵~🤗

I saw my father spoon most of the flour in the porcelain basin ... then add water ... add yeast powder ... then knead it carefully ... knead it well and put it aside ... wash his hands and then put the chopping board on the table ... then put the washed meat and fried Salt dish in each small bowl of inside. In the early morning, my mother went to the vegetable garden to pull out the cleaned shallots and brought them back one by one ~ my father cut the meat into lumps first ... then into lumps ... then into shreds ... then cut them into foam piles together ... add all kinds of seasonings and mix them well ~ ~ looking at them, I felt that I had learned my hand secretly ... ha ha

My mother looked at me like I was greedy for cats ... and I was having fun ~😂

Now for breakfast in the morning, my children and I can both eat steamed buns made by my father, which is very happy ~ ~ ~ a bowl of coarse cereal porridge and a few steamed buns, and I will support The Wall with mirth ~🤗
