东林寺在九江庐山地区，是一个非常有名的寺庙，乃至于全国都是有一定名气的大寺院 🏯

据记载 ...东林寺于1983年被国务院确定为佛教全国重点寺院，具体位于庐山西麓，是净土宗发源地。这里有不少的文化底蕴，外加一些时间的产物，所以时间久了，香火也就越发的旺盛~~

我长这么大...连江西最风景如画秀丽巍峨的庐山都没去过呢😅 这次是随亲盆好友，才有幸瞻仰庐山脚下一处东林寺。好在南昌离东林寺也不远，盆友驾车约3小时左右路程就到了，下车即迫不及待游览东林寺美景的心情只增不减

我们站在山脚，往上望去，不知登塔的石阶有多少，石阶两旁是成排高大笔直的竹林，郁郁葱葱，遮蔽成荫，有世外桃源似的幽雅和清净

到东林寺的入口 ...远望去，规模宏大的东林寺远景更是壮观啊!!周围是一处赫赫有名的佛教丛林，我一口气登上塔顶，绕塔一周，望望远处风景，看看近旁的芸芸众生，顿似有所悟了...

当我们来到东林寺正门口时，就已深深感受到佛教圣神庄严的气氛

在门口有人告诉我们，进东林寺有个规矩：女生不能散发，进门要左脚先跨不能踩门槛，因为寺庙对着装有要求，不能穿短裙，有个小姐姐刚开始给了我一块粉红色遮布，感觉跟今天所穿裙子不太搭，我自己主动跟小姐姐说能换一块吗？小姐姐同意了，围起来感觉还好不是特别丑🙈 有点小羞涩了...😅

进入大厅，正面的西方极乐世界依正庄严图，就给我们一种震撼!!这是用绘画艺术表达对极乐世界的赞叹与向往啊 ...如果想多了解一些净土宗文化的话，也可以在接待大厅的展板前慢慢浏览...

然后大家一起跟着众人去礼佛 ...里面墙面上写着，佛曰:佛事门中，有求必应!然而我的脑子里却一时空空的，想不起来想求什么... 这是不是就是求而不求、不求而求的境界呢 ...

我们随行静静地欣赏着寺内的每一栋建筑，格外的别致和吸引人...每处都时而伴随着檀木的香味!不知不觉地就被融入到严肃圣神的氛围里，一路欣赏 ... 一路感慨...

这里的一切都是那样的清静 ...宁静，人们走动的步子，看风景的姿态，悄声交谈的声音，每一处殿堂，甚至那些风景，都给人宁静、庄严的感受,佛门清静，真是一方静土!

行走在苑中，随处可见虔诚的修士，感受佛的洗礼，每个人到这里都会有收获的，走一走看一看，可以学到很多东西，给自己一次灵魂的升华

出于好奇，我悄悄地观察到寺院里设有不少的功德箱，却没有人强迫你；投到功德箱里的钱，完全凭香客、游人自己的意愿而定。我不由得从心里发出赞叹:细微之处尽显佛门清静之地的圣洁。在物欲横流的当今，要做到这点，着实属不易!东林寺不愧为千年名寺古刹！

离开东林寺的时候，尽管时已下午，但我们兴致依然很高 ~~ 我们边走到东林寺的大门作背景合影留念(照片就不放这了，毕竟佛门清净地，与这些照片不搭)

东林寺是一座去了就不想走，走了还想去的寺院，真是令人难忘啊!

Donglin temple in jiujiang lushan mountain area, is a very famous temple, even the big temple 🏯 has a certain reputation

According to the record... Donglin temple was designated by the state council as the key temple of Buddhism in China in 1983. Located at the western foot of lushan mountain, it is the birthplace of pure land Buddhism. There are a lot of cultural deposits here, plus some products of time, so a long time, incense also more vigorous ~~

I grew up... Even the most beautiful picturesque majestic in jiangxi 😅 haven't been to lushan? This time with close friends, the honour in a donglin temple at the foot of lushan mountain. Fortunately, nanchang is not far from the donglin temple, friends drive about 3 hours on the road, get off the bus can't wait to visit the donglin temple scenery mood only increase not reduce

We stood at the foot of the mountain, looking up, I do not know how many steps to climb the tower, stone steps on both sides is a row of tall straight bamboo forest, lush, shaded into the shade, there is a paradise like elegant and clean

The entrance to donglin temple... Look far away, the grand donglin temple perspective is even more spectacular ah! Surrounded by a famous buddhist jungle, I climbed to the top of the tower, around the tower once, looking at the distant scenery, see the people nearby, seems to have realized...

When we come to the gate of donglin temple, we can deeply feel the solemn atmosphere of the buddhist holy spirit

Someone told us at the door, into the donglin temple have a rule: the girl can't send out, the door to his left foot across the first can't step on the threshold, because temple has asked to dress, can't wear short skirt, a little sister first gave me a pink cover cloth, feel with wear a skirt today don't take, I volunteered to say can change a little sister? Little sister agreed, surrounded feeling also very not is extremely ugly 🙈 a little shy... 😅

Entering the hall, the front of the western paradise according to the solemn picture, give us a shock! This is the art of painting to express the appreciation and longing for the paradise ah... If you want to know more about pure land culture, you can also linger in front of the exhibition board in the reception hall...

Then everyone followed the crowd to worship the Buddha... Written on the wall inside, the Buddha said: in the Buddha's door, everything is required! But for a moment my mind was empty. I could not think of anything to ask for... Is this the realm of seeking without seeking, without seeking without seeking?

We went along quietly to enjoy each building in the temple, which was exceptionally unique and attractive... Every now and then the sandalwood smells! Imperceptibly integrated into the serious spirit of the atmosphere, along the way to enjoy... Feeling all the way...

Everything here is so quiet... Quiet, the pace of people walking, the gesture of looking at the scenery, the voice of whispering conversation, every hall, even those scenery, give people a quiet, solemn feeling, the buddhist gate is quiet, really a quiet land!

Walking in the garden, everywhere can see pious monks, feel the baptism of the Buddha, everyone here will have a harvest, walk a look, you can learn a lot of things, give yourself a spiritual sublimation

Out of curiosity, I quietly observed that there are many merit boxes in the temple, but no one forced you; The money thrown into the box of merit depends entirely on the wishes of pilgrims and visitors themselves. I couldn't help but extol from the heart: the details all show the holiness of the buddhist gate. In today's materialistic, to do this, it is not easy! Donglin temple is worthy of thousands of years famous temple temple!

When we left donglin temple, although it was already afternoon, we were still in high spirits. We walked to the gate of donglin temple and took a group photo in the background.

Donglin temple to do not want to go to the temple, go also want to go to the temple, it is unforgettable ah!
