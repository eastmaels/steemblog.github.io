昨个我在盆友圈⭕️ 发了张我做的新菜，本想只是好玩得瑟下，也是分享嘛(´-ω-`)因为第一次做口感不错～ 味道还非常棒呢！熊孩纸吃的最多😅 没想到反应还不错呢！很多亲们都来围观点赞了🤭

看样子这菜做的很成功啊😎

前几个月我曾分享过一篇「养生西兰花排骨汤」的帖子，这次再来分享西兰花炒年糕吧(⑉°з°)-♡

西兰花🥦因为营养丰富，搭配很多菜食用也非常好吃，做法非常多，所以有很多fans~ 我家人就都蛮喜欢吃西兰花，餐桌上隔三差五就会出现

那么常吃西兰花🥦的好处这里再次科普下啦！它可维持牙齿及骨骼的平衡生长，还能保护视力、提高记忆力！这个对于儿童发育和中老年人来说是非常好的补充营养...

而且它在医学界，常被认为对大脑的营养补充起到很好的作用，重点还可以抗衰老，防止皮肤干燥，是一种非常好的美容佳品呢！！这个对我们女人👩 而言是非常需要的佳肴美食啊！特别是现在秋冬季节皮肤更需要的保健

不仅如此，西兰花🥦 还能增强肝脏的解毒功能，常食可提高人体的机能免疫力，总之，西兰花🥦 (花椰菜)的好处多多啦

年糕是中华食文化，它蕴藏了中华民族千年来的文化积淀，年糕特别在重要节假日里几乎都会看到的美食，因为它有个美好的寓意，岁岁为人们带来新的希望，寓意万事如意年年高！在过节时吃年糕，营养节节高， 事业节节高啊！

年糕它富含碳水化合物、蛋白质、脂肪、钙、磷、钾等营养素，最主要的营养价值是碳水化合物上，因为碳水化合物是人一天热量的主要来源，年糕经过特殊工艺的制作，其口感软糯，更容易吸收了，更是在食材多样的今天合理健康的搭配食物，年糕做出的美味更出彩

年糕的选材也很重要，要买到正宗口感好的年糕，我这是淘宝网上买的，宁波汤圆年糕都是很出名的，我这个听说是现做现卖的就淘了10斤/1份，收到后一打开，米香扑鼻而来啊... 看样子很不错

我一边切成薄片一边流口水鸭🤤 😅 全部切好薄片后放冰箱冷冻起来，吃多少再取多少就好

再来分享西兰花🥦 炒年糕的做法

- 首先年糕要放清水里浸泡解冻下，如果是刚买来的也要用水浸泡下，这样烹制时方便
- 预先备着切好的大蒜子和小米椒适量(喜欢吃肉的也可切点精肉咯！现在肉贵的死我就省着不用也好吃的😂 )
- 西兰花洗净用剪刀✂️ 剪成细小块备用
- 热锅倒入适量食用油烧热倒入西兰花炒软出锅备用
- 再倒入食用油烧热爆香大蒜子和小米椒
- 再倒入备好的年糕片一起翻炒片刻，加入点开水继续翻炒，炒软年糕片
- 接着倒入事先炒好的西兰花一起翻炒下
- 加入生抽/适量食盐/耗油，翻炒片刻再加点胡椒粉提鲜
- 翻炒下下就可出锅装盘开吃了^ω^

当当当当～ 这盘西兰花炒年糕颜值不错吧！✨ 🤩 看我盆友圈图片就知道了哈🤭

不过友情提示下：平时血糖波动异常的盆友们慎食年糕，因为血糖生成指数比较高，另外呢，年糕一次不能吃太多了，因年糕淀粉含量高，不易消化，会刺激胃分泌大量胃酸，吃多了有可能会反酸的现象，无助于身体健康哈🧡

🥦🥦🥦🥦🥦🥦

But friendship prompt: abnormal blood glucose fluctuations of friends eating rice cakes at ordinary times, because of the high glycemic index comparison, in addition, rice cakes can't eat too much at a time, because rice cakes high starch content, not easy to digest, can stimulate gastric secretion of hydrochloric acid in gastric juice, eat more likely the phenomenon of acid regurgitation, not healthy ha 🧡
