前天中奖到手的影票，马上和熊孩纸进入影城2号厅就坐好了... 提早了5分钟还没开场，于是先沾小仙儿肉的光哈🤭 自拍秀一波咯🤩

还没来得及多拍几张，熊孩纸已经按捺不住影院的气氛了... 因为是动漫片子嘛，大多数都是粑粑麻麻带孩纸来看的，现场只要有一个小盆友笑出声，立马就是全场的熊孩纸起哄哄啦!😂

熄灯了!电影开始🎬 映入眼帘的是一位大肚子的太乙真人搞笑出场，他正在收拾混元珠!!(听熊孩纸解说的，我根本就不认识他们是谁😅 )

The day before yesterday the film ticket in hand, and bear children immediately into the cinema hall 2 sitting well... Didn't start early for 5 minutes, then to the light of touch small XianEr meat 🤭 autodyne show a wave of luo 🤩

Before I could shoot more pictures, the kids couldn't resist the atmosphere of the cinema... Because they are anime films, most of them are brought by our children. As soon as a child laughs out loud, the audience will be full of kids. 😂

Lights out! Movie start 🎬 is a big belly too b real funny appearance, he is picking up mixed yuan bead!!!!! (listen to bear children explanation, I don't even know who they are 😅)


我只对即将出场的魔童哪吒较感兴趣，说到哪吒，今时片中的哪吒已改往日印象中的形象了，以前脑海里认为他是很可爱的小神童，现在叫小魔童啦哈哈... 请问这是饺子导演的另类创意么...

王菲同款的烟熏妆大眼‘妹子’诶😅一排平刘海...  还有一口炒鸡大板牙着实可爱... 潮童一枚哈哈!!俩手插着小裤兜耍酷起来不要不要滴!!这形象一看就是叛逆好斗爱整的小魔童了!

哪吒一出生就被魔丸附体，性情自不免暴虐了，还险些就酿成大祸!!! 太乙真人本来是要杀他于襁褓中... 哪吒麻麻实不忍心地说: “不管他是不是魔丸，也不管他会不会死，他都是我怀胎三年生下的骨肉啊!’’宁可舍命都要救下亲生骨肉... 母爱的力量无人能敌啊!!

可太乙真人又告诉她，没🈶 用的，元始天尊已经给这颗魔丸定下死期，这孩纸3年后还是要死去的...

手持混天绫，脚踩风火轮的小哪吒对着天地大喊道：“命运对我不公，我就要和他斗到底”!!!好有个性的小哪吒！

I am only interested in the upcoming magic child nezha. Speaking of nezha, now nezha in the movie has changed his image in the past. I thought he was a cute little prodigy in my mind before, but now he is called little magic child haha... Excuse me, this is dumplings director's alternative creative yao...

Wang Feitong of sootiness makeup wouldn 'sister' aye 😅 a row of flat bang... And a big Fried chicken teeth is really cute... A hipster haha!! Two hands inserted small trouser pocket play cool do not drop!! This image is a rebellious and aggressive love of the whole little devil child!

Nezha was born to be magic pill possession, temperament naturally tyrannical, but also almost lead to disaster!!! Taiyi was supposed to kill him in his swaddling clothes... Nezha's ma ma cannot bear to say: "whether he is magic ball or not, whether he will die or not, he is my flesh and blood born after three years of pregnancy! Better lay down one's life to save one's own flesh and blood... The power of a mother's love can not rival ah!

But reality and tell her too b, not 🈶, beginning Buddha has given this magic pill for death, three years after the child will die...

Holding hun tian dampot, nezha shouted to heaven and earth: "fate is unfair to me, I will fight with him to the end"!!! Nice little personality nezha!

为了救自己的亲身骨肉，也为给哪吒求生的欲望，哪吒的粑粑李靖和太乙真人跑到天界，李靖决定默默地为哪吒挡天雷

与此同时，哪吒麻麻为了给孩纸行善积德，正忙碌地努力为百姓除魔降妖!!... 这样子因为疏于没能好好陪伴哪吒而感到内疚的麻麻，竟然冒着危险陪“天生神力”的哪吒踢起毽子来... 在看到哪吒麻麻一而再... 再而三被踢受伤，只好穿上铠甲，但还是依然不放弃地说：“我吒儿好久没有这么开心过了!’’ (母爱的伟大让我动容地落泪了😭 )

而当哪吒被冤枉时，他的爸妈并没有误解，还挺身帮哪吒洗身冤屈... 为了给娃过3岁生日宴，李靖就是磕头也要把百姓请来(好感动地父爱(⑉°з°)-♡母爱...)

为了哪吒，李靖夫妇本决定隐居，可为了娃不因魔丸之身的三年限期S去，... 李靖决定让他学习仙法正道

在这个故事里，本是一个注定要遭受天雷... 后到逆天改命... 再后来成为拯救苍生的少年哪吒，他的成长要归功他的好父母

In order to save their own flesh and blood, but also to give which zha's desire to survive, which zha's baba li jing and tai yi real people ran to heaven, li jing decided to quietly stop day thunder for which zha

At the same time, nezha ma ma in order to do good to children, is busy working hard for the people in addition to the devil fall demon! cars only This way because of the lack of good company nezha felt guilty ma ma, even at risk to accompany "natural power" nezha kicked up the shuttlecock... See nezha ma ma again... Again three be kicked to get hurt, have to put on armor, but still still don't give up ground to say: "my a son for a long time have no so happy lead! "(the greatness of a mother's love made me moving to tears 😭)

And when nezha was wronged, his parents did not misunderstand, but also to help nezha wash... For over three years old birthday feast, excavate is kowtowing to also want to put the people invited (good moved to father (⑉ ° з °) - ♡ love... )

For nezha, li jing and his wife decided to live in seclusion, but in order to Eva not because of magic pills of the body of the three years deadline S to go... Li jing decided to let him learn the immortal way

In this story, Ben is destined to suffer a thunderstorm... And then against the odds... Later he became a saving boy nezha, whose growth was attributed to his good parents

因为李靖夫妇从没一丝放弃过哪吒!! 一直都默默地帮助哪吒找回自信的他，无条件的包容接纳他，给他正爱

反观影片中，还有另一对父子敖丙和龙王，龙王生下敖丙就对他充满了“欲望”，虽然给了他灵珠和最硬的万鳞甲，但是也给了他振兴龙族使命的压力感

李靖和龙王这两位截然不同的父亲，就像我们生活中的两种父亲! 一种永远是威严的为你谋划未来铺好路，打着为你好的旗号，替你决定着一件又一件的事情!! 而另一种永远都是在身后默默地支持鼓励着你👍

好的电影总是会在刹那间激动人心啊...💓 影片中李靖夫妇如何让娃在感受父母爱里快乐成长!!这样哒孩纸总是更快乐，容易满足的幸福感... 因为他已经感同身受地从父母那里学会了如何爱己爱他人

我也强烈推荐这部电影👍 希望每位父母带着孩纸或是自己在电影里感受到一个不一样的童年... 整片欢笑不停... 感动不停...

最后影片都快结束了，还是迟迟不亮灯散场，屏幕中突然出现几个大字... 彩蛋即将出现，看你们哪个敢走!!🤣  全场哗哗地坐下了!原来该片导演剧组来到现场与观众见面会的彩蛋... 哈哈😅

现场采访了几位观影盆友，谈谈影片感受啦，然后自然还有老套路，看影片官方微博评好分啦!!最后全场和导演饺子大合影留念! 也不知看得到咱们和大牌上屏幕照不😂 😂

Because li jing and his wife never gave up nezha!! He has been quietly helping nezha find his confidence, unconditionally accepting him and giving him love

In the film, there is another pair of father and son ao c and the dragon king, the dragon king gave birth to ao c is full of "desire" to him, although gave him spirit bead and the hardest ten thousand scales, but also gave him to revitalize the dragon mission of the pressure

Li jing and the dragon king are two very different fathers, just like the two fathers in our life! One is always dignified for you to plan for the future to pave the road, under the banner of good for you, for you to decide one thing after another! While another is always behind you silently support 👍 encourage you

Good movies are always exciting in a flash... 💓 oxidase in the film happy couples how to make the Eva in the feelings of parents' love grew up!! This way kids are always happier, happier, happier... Because he has learned from his parents how to love himself and others with empathy

I strongly recommend this movie 👍 also hope every parents take their children or their feeling in the movie as a different kind of childhood... The whole laugh goes on... Moved...

Finally, the film is almost over, or the light is not finished, the screen suddenly appeared a few words... Easter eggs will appear, see which of you dare to walk! 🤣 full spouted sit down! The original film director cast came to the scene and meet the audience Easter eggs... Ha ha 😅

We interviewed some friends on the spot and talked about their feelings about the film. Then, naturally, there are some old ways. Finally, the audience and director dumplings big group photo! Don't know can see us and on the big screen as not 😂 😂
