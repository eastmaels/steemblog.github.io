今天周末，孩子们不用上学，昨天我们早起去钓鱼，今天终于可以赖一下床了，我们到了快10点才起床，今天没有煮早餐，孩子爸爸早餐喜欢吃面，鸡肉面，猪肉面，牛肉面，什么带肉的面都可以，难怪长的胖。今天小儿子也已经起床了，小儿子今年已经8岁了，教育孩子是艰难而又让我深感温暖的旅程，特别是他们性格不尽相同，教育孩子也是我人生另一个修行吧，孩子的成长也是我的成长。孩子长大，渐渐有自己的想法了，我觉得要教育他们有责任感，要慢慢的开始学会独立做事情了。所以今天我决定让他去为我们买早餐，告诉他买早餐的位置，然后给了他10元，让他自己选择买什么早餐回来给我们，他就自己下楼了。This weekend, the children do not have to go to school, yesterday we got up early to go fishing, today we can finally get out of bed, we got up at almost 10 o'clock, today did not cook breakfast, the children's father like to eat noodles for breakfast, chicken noodles, pork noodles, beef noodles, anything with meat noodles can be, no wonder the growing fat. Today, my younger brother has also got up, my younger brother is 8 years old this year, it is a difficult and warm journey to educate children, especially their personalities are not the same, educating children is another practice in my life, the growth of children is also my growth. Children grow up, gradually have their own ideas, I think to educate them to have a sense of responsibility, to slowly start learning to do things independently. So today I decided to ask him to buy breakfast for us, tell him where to buy it, and then give him 10 yuan, let him choose what breakfast to buy for us, and he went downstairs by himself.<hr>![微信图片_20180923152309.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPyrwpwhpGBWbJWpBMTWMdk7JNPZpuCrTmf3iwaCa37Wv)<hr>过了一会，他就回来了，带着一袋好吃的，呵呵，看着他带回来的早餐，真的很暖心。他为爸爸买了一份肠粉，买了一碗白粥给我，为他自己买了一个茶叶蛋。虽然是很简单的早餐，意义对我来说是不一样的。After a while, he came back, brought breakfast back, he bought a bowel powder for his father, bought a bowl of white porridge for me, bought an egg for himself. Though it is a very simple breakfast, the meaning is different for me.<hr>![微信图片_20180923152345.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPJdkTtdnpuruVjXDup7HAh4vrq6N75Fe89zDvFeCwsFN)<br>![微信图片_20180923152356.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmVSHWqNxLAzwhGd9C9Lp54G9buMSkufcgFkusSKS6EP4Y)<br>![微信图片_20180923152351.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmdMDEGL9jCxUphVmphRgndeh4E6hrJ8afSyXTcnkKsvzB)<hr>感谢大家投票并关注我，如果需要用到我的照片，请询问并在文中写明出处。
