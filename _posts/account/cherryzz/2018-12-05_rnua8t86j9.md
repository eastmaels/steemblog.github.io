东湖公园一年一度的菊花展开始了，准备到菊花展去拍点照片。The annual Chrysanthemum Exhibition at Donghu Park began, ready to take photos at the Chrysanthemum Exhibition.

周末和孩子们一起去了，刚到公园门口就感觉人非常的多，大概是天气好，又是周末的缘故吧。
I went with the children on the weekend. There were so many people at the door, probably the weather was good, and it was the weekend.

进到公园，我顿时就没有拍照的欲望了，可能是看的人太多，大人小孩的，地上的草都光秃了，公园的菊花已经打不起精神了。
When I entered the park, I suddenly had no desire to take pictures. It may be that there were too many people watching, and the chrysanthemums in the park were already drying up.![3e2103dbfd583a6678b7e728797ad96.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmWXYCkaHKy9RND7DE2Negkjpm6ThyfRcdBfbeDB3hyW5F)

最后我们在公园里野餐了，孩子们玩了一天,我最后也拍了一些菊花和大家分享一下吧。Finally, we had a picnic in the park. The children played for a day. I finally took some chrysanthemums and shared it with everyone.
