第一节课刚接触到帆船帆板，一个年轻的小教练在教他们各种帆船的知识。教完后，还让每个孩子们上去帆船上做练习操作，这个是上午学习的内容。
在儿子3年级的时候，也来过帆船教育基地学习过基础的知识！当时是整个年级都要来学习的，简单的帆船的安装方法等等。The first class just came into contact with sailboats. A young coach was teaching them all kinds of sailboats. After the teaching, each child was also allowed to go on the sailing boat to do exercises. This is what I learned in the morning.
When my son was in grade 3, he also came to the sailing education base to learn basic knowledge. At that time, the whole grade had to come to learn, simple sailing installation methods and so on.

训练基地在海边，这里的设备很齐全，有救生衣，下海的时候必须穿上的。还有室内学习休息的地方，还分好了一些小木屋给不同的学校学生放自己的物品。上午教完了在帆船帆板的安装过程，还教了两种结绳的方法。
The training base is located at the seaside. The equipment here is very complete. There are life jackets and they must be worn when entering the sea. There are also places for indoor study and rest, and some cabins have been allocated for different school students to put their own belongings. In the morning, I finished teaching the installation process of sailboard and two rope tying methods.

下午吃完午饭，休息过后，终于来到下海的环节了，孩子们非常的兴奋，换好了训练服后，还把救生衣穿起来了，下午下海先热身，孩子们在水里玩的很开心。热身后休息了一下，然后到实操了，上午学的装帆板，和怎么开帆船。
After lunch and rest in the afternoon, the children finally came to the sea. They were very excited. After changing their training clothes, they also put on their life jackets. They warmed up before going to sea in the afternoon. The children had a good time in the water.After warming up, I took a rest, and then went to practice. I learned how to sail sailing in the morning.

一天的活动结束了，晚上住在这里的酒店，因为是周六过去的，孩子们带上了作业过去完成。一天下来，孩子们都很累了，有的小孩写着写着就睡着了！这里的夜景很美。
The activity of the day ended, and I stayed in the hotel here at night, because it was Saturday and the children took their homework to finish it. At the end of the day, the children were very tired, and some of them fell asleep when they wrote.The night scene here is still very beautiful.

第二天的训练又开始了，孩子们吃了酒店的自助早餐后就开始去训练基地了，开始今天的课程。
上午练习如何掌握好帆船的方向，大海的浪很大，所以今天的练习都在港湾这里，这里的海水比较平静。孩子们练习起来会更容易掌握。中午的时候很晒，在练习了开船后，来到室内学习帆船遇到不同的风向，会怎么运动等等。
The next day's training started again. After the children ate the breakfast buffet in the hotel, they started to go to the training base and start today's class.
In the morning, I practiced how to master the direction of the sailing boat. The sea is very rough, so today's exercises are all in the harbor, where the sea is relatively calm. Children will be easier to master when they practice.It was very sunny at noon. After practicing sailing, I came indoors to learn how sailing boats would move in different wind directions and so on.

今天是第二天训练了，下午的课程到4点半就结束了。
中午午饭过后，开始了下午的课程，这节课需要孩子们上船后，把船弄翻，反过来，模拟帆船在海上遇到风浪吹翻了，如何把船翻过来，然后爬到船上面去。

下午这节课很有趣，有的孩子在船上下水的一瞬间很害怕，不怕水的就觉的很好玩，有的孩子太重了，爬不上船，把船又弄翻过来了，下午的课程孩子们玩的很开心。
Today is the second day of training, and the afternoon session ends at 4: 30.
After lunch at noon, the afternoon class began. This class requires the children to turn over the boat after getting on board. In turn, the simulated sailing boat is blown over by the wind and waves at sea. How to turn over the boat and then climb onto the boat?
This afternoon's lesson was very interesting. Some children were scared when they were on the boat and felt very funny when they were not afraid of the water. Some children were too heavy to climb onto the boat and turned the boat over again. The afternoon's lesson was very fun for the children.

上完课后，换好衣服，收拾好行李，就准备回家了，大梅沙海滩被去年的台风：山竹，摧毁的很严重，刚在4月份才修好才开放接待游客的。这里没有地铁能到，只有公交车，到了夏季，这里的人特别多，水上运动中心的旁边就是大梅沙海滩，这两天也是人山人海了。以前我也会带孩子来玩，10点左右路上就会开始堵车，下午5点开始，回程的路上也开始塞车了，这两年私家车如果要到这里，需要预约，才可以开车进来。这样才舒缓了这里的交通路况。
After class, I changed my clothes, packed my luggage, and was ready to go home. Dameisha beach was badly destroyed by last year's typhoon, Yamazaki. It was only repaired in April before it was opened for tourists. There is no subway here, only buses. In summer, there are a lot of people here. Next to the water sports center is Dameisha Beach, which is also crowded these two days. In the past, I also brought my children to play. The traffic jam started around 10 o'clock on the road and started at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. The traffic jam also started on the way back. In the past two years, private cars need to make an appointment before they can drive in. Only in this way can the traffic conditions here be eased.
