This picture was taken from this <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/96qvxb/here_is_my_bank_instalment_related_to_the_loan_i/">Reddit post</a>, where a guy goes deep in shithole by taking a whooping $300k Dirham loan for cryptocurrency investment when literally every coins were at its all-time-high.

He is at 85% loss and paying 8k every month now for another 3.5 years.

Simple picture ans ahort story, but it hurts my eyes so much. Ouch.

While I absolutely feel for the unfortunate guy, on the other hand this is a real and lively example to teach us the definition of <strong>bubble</strong>.

Throw away all the obscure financial term to explain <em>bubble</em> from Investopedia, this is how a bubble was formed. People go all in FOMO mode even borrow money from bank which they can't afford to lose and throw it all in the Bitcoin. When things go south, god bless him to have a job to pay back all those debt.

Greed don't make you go all in, but beyond all in.
