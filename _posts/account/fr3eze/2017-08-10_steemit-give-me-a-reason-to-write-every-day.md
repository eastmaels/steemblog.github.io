I'm interested in reading everything about lifehacks. From books, magazine, to Quora and YouTube. Because it is so fun to find out something little that you never thought of, can actually bring a huge effect to any aspect of life. Work, relationship, health, finance, even baking techniques, you name it.

One of the most mentioned lifehacks is **write something everyday**.

### Why should we write every day

- **Strengthens idea muscle**

In order to write something, you will have to think more. More thinking leads to more question, and you will have to actively find out answers. This is how ideas are formed. Repeats this process every day is like a daily mental practice that increases our psychological energy. It sounds normal going to the gym for physical training, may be you working out every now and then. What about start training the brain now?



- **Keep a journal of our mental development**

People love to take pictures and record clips because those are the best way to keep memories of precious moments. We tend to have the "missing good old days" feeling when looking back at the pictures and clips. **Well, text does a great job recording down the train of thoughts.**  It will be fun be the witness of ourselves for our mental evolve over the times.


- **Get a war chest of ideas**


>The best way to have a good idea is to have a lot of ideas - Thomas A. Edison


Good ideas can be in everything. Better way to learn, more efficient way to cook, how to improve health, how to save more, what idea to start a new business, what topic to start a conversation. Generally, we will be more knowledgeable and well informed. This makes us able to respond to any situation. We will no longer have the same views on everything around us.

What a lifehack, I should write every day too! 
But I'm a lazy person. All the time I'm aware of this great habit but other than posting some random stuff on Facebook, I didn't write shit. Until...

### I found Steemit!

As crypto-enthusiast, I never know I can become so deeply involved in a crypto project like what Steemit provides. Dan is a genius, Steemit is astonishing, this whole community is just unbelievable. 

**Decentralization social platform + Zero censorship + Total speech freedom + Clean environment without Ads + Huge potential + Earn money instead of useless Thumbs Up...**

The + can goes on. Man, give me a reason to keep my keyboard dusted!
