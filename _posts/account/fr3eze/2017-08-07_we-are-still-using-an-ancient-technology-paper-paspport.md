## Vulnerability of paper passport

Have you ever lost your passport? During trips? Clearing customs? What awaits you will be numerous visits to the customs office, police stations, and embassies. I can definitely imagine the doomed feeling although I have no experience on that yet(touch wood).

Passport is the last thing you want to lose in a foreign country, simply because the maddening troubles you have to go through before getting a new piece of paper to prove your identity again.  Isn't this funny in this modern world? We all relying so much on an extremely vulnerable proof of identity during traveling, we must protect it like our most previous whenever we go, endless troubles ahead if failed to do so. 

## Fortunately, there is Blockchain

With this amazing technology, getting rid of paper passport become realistic. 

- **Flexible capacity**
One of the remarkable features of blockchain is that network capacity can be easily expanded. Migration of traditional passport information to digital form can be done in large scale without pressuring the network much, as there is thousands of hundred computer help scaling the network capability and size.

- **Better security**
There is no single point of failure to shut down the blockchain network. Of course, perfectly secured system is non-existent in the world, but so far nothing offer higher security other than blockchain. There will be no paper passport, thus you will have one item less to keep or to lose.

- **Immutability**
All centralized databases are prone to corruption. One has no options but to trust the third party authority to keep safe our identity. While in the world of blockchain, you have to trust no one. Computer hashing power and algorithm makes it almost impossible to change the history of record in the database. 

- **Faster settlement**
In the case of losing a passport, you need to provide alternative documents as proof of your existence in the world. And those things take forever to be validated. Retrieving information from blockchain is almost instantaneous. As long as you can provide something(may be a private key) that can link to your identity in the network, boom! You are a legal traveler again!

## Final thought
I'm so sick of double checking if my passport is still sleeping well in my bag when I was busy climbing a beautiful mountain or visiting a crowded market in foreign places.  Sure, there are still plenty of technical and political details need to come to an agreement between nations to make all these happen. In fact,
