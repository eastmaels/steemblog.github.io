<p>While Steempress aims to provide a tunnel <em>From Blog to Steem</em>, Vornix is a value-added service for the other direction which is <em>From Steem to Blog</em>. I wish to talk about a few facts to take note while using both services.</p>

<h2 id="1donottakethevotefromsteempressioforgranted">1. Do not take the vote from @steempress-io for granted</h2>

<p>The fact is, the demand for utilizing the Steempress plugin on WordPress surged dramatically for one reason -- @steempress-io received 1M SP delegation and the team aim support the content posted via Steempress plugin.</p>

<p><strong>But that is no way a promise nor a guarantee to secure a vote from the team</strong> in which they summed it well as follows :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You don't expect a tip, but you are happy when you get one. -- <a href="/@steempress-io/steempress-answers-to-common-questions-and-update-to-design">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, if you are creating quality content and going through proper process(by using @vornix for instance) in utilising the Steempress plugin, getting an appreciation token from the team is likely.</p>

<h2 id="2steempresstakes15benefactorreward">2. Steempress takes 15% benefactor reward</h2>

<p>If you are trying to hunt votes from @steempress-io even with the free help from Vornix, this may not be the best motivation of utilizing the platform. While Vornix still is a comoletely free service own your WP site, 15% of your post payout will be taken by the team with or without their votes. And if you think that a vote is guaranteed via the Steempress plugin, stop and refer to the <em>Point 1.</em></p>

<p>Instead of being defensive on the benefactor reward, why don't taking that <strong>as a way to support @steempress-io</strong>? That would works the same way as directly tipping or delegate SP to the team. Their effort of bringing in more talented bloggers into Steem deserves it undoubtedly.</p>

<h2 id="3postonwordpressfirstinsteadofsteemit">3. Post on WordPress first instead of Steemit</h2>

<p>This soinds like obvious but believe me, many who first started blogging on Steem and don't own a blog beforehand will not realise this fact. I'm one of them.</p>

<p>It is especially a habitual change that must be adapted for existing Steemians. Every post from now on have to be posted first on your WordPress site `[username].vornix.blog' and the Steempress plugin should take care of the publishing on Steem.</p>

<p>It can be hard at first to adapt but the process will get much smoother as time goes by.</p>

<h2 id="4vornixisunfriendlytoabusers">4. Vornix is unfriendly to abusers</h2>

<p>Currently Vornix is working with dead simple methodology, user send in any amount with a memo and an free WordPress subdomain will be created. But we observed this generous service starting to show signs of being abused by shit posters with obvious intention of vote-hunting.</p>

<p>Some preventive measurements like account screening and paid plans is under sketching and soon will be released. Vornix is one of the best gateways to access the Steempress plugin and we have zero tolerance towards spammers.</p>
