Few days ago I shared in the [previous post](/cindicator/@fr3eze/test-if-cindicator-could-be-another-wealth-generating-tool) that I was making a small bet on Cindicator's indicator about Stellar coin. It gave a 78% probability that XLM/BTC would trade above 0.000051 before February 20.

**And it was wrong.**

While the whole market is starting to recover, Bitcoin is taking the rising lead from the bad crash to $6000 to around $11000. This resulted in a drop of the majority of altcoins in term of BTC value, including XLM.

Bad thing is, obviously, I 'lose money' because it doesn't play out as planned. But it's OK as I'm more than well-prepared for this to happen and this is just a little fun experiment for me. I felt worse in losing 24 points in the application as I took part in the XLM prediction as well.

As you can see, I made a 74% prediction in that question as well. Couldn't put all the blame on the indicator nonetheless right?

The good thing is I get to know more about Stellar by acquiring them. And I'm not going to sell just because it doesn't meet the initial target, all I have to do is just converting this investment from short-term to medium-term. If I had to be more optimistic, this represents a longer opportunity to buy in with a lower price using Bitcoin.

**Will I still believe in Cindicator?**

Of course, it's not like they have failed me 10 times in a row. In fact, they never guaranteed a 100% accuracy, nothing did.

几天前根据 Cindicator 买的 XLM 信号，结局是**预测错误**。XLM/.BTC 并没有在二月二十号之前越过 0.000051 BTC 。比特币从前一阵子的狂跌至 $6000 恢复到目前的 $11000，可谓十分强势。也难怪所有小货币们在和比特币的对比当中落下风了。

算了吧，反正这也是预料中事，几天的短期投机本来就是充满风险。不卖就不算亏损。

好处是，透过这次的投机行动我认识了 Stellar 这个很不错的项目，就算短期内脱不了手也大可转为长期持有。如果说还不够乐观，那就把这次机会当作是低价入手 XLM 的时机拉长了吧。
