First of all kudos to the awesome site owner `disifi` who puts up an effort for the updated and neat site: https://merit.disifi.com

From there you can access all the useful tools and site of Merit, like the Network hashrate, difficulty, Wallet of anyone, Mining profitability calculator, available mining pools and so on.

## Network status

This page would tell you all the stats that matter in a blockchain activity, especially valuable for the miners to read stats like Network cycles/s, block time, current supply and latest price.

## What software should you use for mining?

I found the [mining-software page](https://merit.disifi.com/wiki/mining-software) is exceptionally useful as I was in the process of hunting efficient Merit miners. Used to run the official minerd miner 0.2.0 for a long time and did not bother for a few weeks. Wrong move. Found this site and changed to the latest miner I now have got +30% mining performance. The cost of ignorance.

## Mining Calculator

Base on my current improved hasrate with new miner I would get close to 0.4 cycle/s with a gaming graphic card which is equivalent to 3.5 MRT/day, or about $1 a day if you don't mind I round the number up too far. Best tool especially for someone to get an idea before starting mining. 

## Join the Merit mining club

The best thing about mining Merit is that you don't have to download the complicated miners and set up things like doing a rocket science, just download their light wallet with their mining feature built in. CPU and GPU are both supported and you are just one-click away from mining!

I have limited invites to giveaway to interested miners and those who are intended to extend their network, click the link below to setup your wallet and I shall send out the invite ticket ASAP if I know you are legitï¼Œ miners are prioritized:
