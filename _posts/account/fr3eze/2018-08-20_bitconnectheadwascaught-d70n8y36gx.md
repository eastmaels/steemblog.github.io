The once top 10 coins in 2017, Bitconnect maybe got out of the sight of public for a long time since the epic fall. But there are much follow-ups to trail if you are interested enough in this biggest scam ever in crypto history. And I hope yoir interest was not raised as a victim.

The Bitconnect head in India has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/india-bitconnect-head-arrested/">arrested</a> lately. But how would that makes a difference to the harm which has already been done? Trivial. The biggest lesson in this arrest is that if you are going to scam around next time, maybe <em>be smarter and try not to get caught.</em>

<h2>Don't hope for the refund</h2>

If you are one of the victim, admit the fact that you are terribly scammed. The money is as good as gone, the best one can do is praying hard that the guilty scam executives be found guilty and put behind the bars for some years.

However, that doesn't help those who borrowed loan from bank or splashing all his life saving on the obvious scam. Speaking of borrow a loan for crypto, this poor guy looks better assuming he did not pour the money into Bitconnect.

<h2>This is not the end</h2>

Crypto has been the great place for all kind of scam artists as it is mostly not regulated and thanks to the virtual properties of currency. Bitconnect is not the first and certianly won't be the last. If you encounter any new project giving out a very ambitous promise like, 30% return in a week or even day, remember that <strong>if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</strong>

消息指出在印度的 Bitconnect 头头已经被捕。但是那又如何？曾经进入十大的骗局货币如今剩下的只是各种被害人的辛酸故事，和外人看热闹的后续发展。头头被捕除了大快人心其实也起不了什么正面作用。被骗走的钱不会回来，借贷的钱该还还是要还。这不是第一个骗局，这绝对不会是最后一个。看热闹之余，在这个凶险的币圈里，keep your eyes and mind open!
