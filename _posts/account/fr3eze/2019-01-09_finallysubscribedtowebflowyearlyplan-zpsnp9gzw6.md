I've been waiting for this day since day 1 I started using Webflow. This is the first WYSIWYG web building tool that is so useful and well built that I'm willing to make my most expensive($192 per year) online service subscription ever! The designer tool hardly gives me any troubles at the same offering tons of benefits that is nowhere to find on other similar tools, free or paid.

Webflow actually provides a perfect way for anyone who likes to design a website <strong>without touching a single line of code</strong>. And the best thing is, the <a href="https://webflow.com/designer">designer tool</a> are all free to use <strong>at full functionalities</strong>. One can exploit 100% of the Webflow power before plan upgrading and thats what I did(been building my first webpage for 2 months without paying a cent). It helps the transition of visual design tool to hand coding much smoother for me too, especially after being able to export the code and trying to understand how things work behind the scene, and trying to add custom codes.

<strong>The community is active</strong> and helpful, basically any issue you encountered with the tool someone has asked before on the forum and solution was given. So far I don't have to fire a question myself because everything is on the table.

However, the only shortcoming will be the limited functionalities. When I said limited, the comparison was with the hand coding which possibilities are endless hence this is not really a fair argument. While I'm sure the existing functionalities are more than suffice for a basic to intermediate website, custom code support in the paid plan is definitely something nice to have to add features that are not yet available on the platform.

Sometimes I imagine if one day I can hand code a full website, I would still start <em>sketching</em> using Webflow **because it speeds up the process dramatically* and make the process much more enjoyable.

Can't recommend Webflow enough for those beginners of web designers. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/finally-subscribed-to-webflow-yearly-plan/ </em><hr/></center>
