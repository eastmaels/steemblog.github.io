Since the day I started a really minor mining rig, the mining strategy has always been aiming the Jackpot coins because I do not want waste all the electricity and time competing with those monstous hashrate out there.

It means I would spend big portion of my time digging through the mountains of new coins everyday hoping to discover some interesting projects. And I've become quite a new-coin-sensitive guys ever since. Rolling in the sea of shitcoins is no easy task.

<h2>Introduing a shitcoin which I hope is not a shitcoin soon.</h2>

Yeah every currency-centric coins on the market obviously claims to achieve the same thing. Replace the <em>Merit</em> with other coin's name and everyting would looks legit as usual. I can't say how innovative this coin is but there somehow Merit has some shinny points though. Cut off all the BS selling points like <em>allowing to securely send to an address</em>, or <em>mind-blowing mining mechanism</em>, let's take a look of what attracted me a little

<ul>
<li><strong>Send to Anyone</strong> even to those who are not yet in the network. Via Email, SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram, you name it.</p></li>
<li><p>Make wallet address tied to alias name. Though many projects has already implemented this and the best one is the very Steem, this is not bad of a system to have in other projects nonetheles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cancellable Transactions</strong> as long as the money is not yet accepted. Cool idea.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No ICO, or premine</strong> is definitely a plus point for jackpot hunter like me.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Really informative website</strong>: https://www.merit.me</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Active GitHub communities</strong>: https://github.com/meritlabs/merit</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impressive light wallet</strong> that has everything you need in one place, including mining.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Invite-only</strong> system, you do not simply join without an invite.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decentralized Account Recovery</strong> and <strong>Smart Contracts</strong> is in the progress.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to join?</h2>

<p>Enough of shilling and let's get to the point, if you are new user(very likely) download the wallet using my link: https://wallet.merit.me/?invite=fr3eze

This way I would be notified immediately and send you your invite. Without the invite the wallet will be remained locked. And if you have a wallet but need the invite to unlock it, use my code as well: <code>@fr3eze</code>.
