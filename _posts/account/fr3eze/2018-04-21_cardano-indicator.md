>The cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA/BTC) settled at 0.0000328 BTC at 07:30 PM UTC at the Binance exchange on Thursday, April 19. In your opinion, will ADA/BTC trade above 0.000036 BTC (+10%) at any time before April 26?
**Indicator: 86.61%**

This is the recent indicator I received from Cindicator from the Beginner plan. 

Cardano is the *Ethereum of Japan* and having one of the highest [commits record](https://www.cryptomiso.com/months_6.html) in Github. I have a have high hope and definitely holding some ADA for its bullish future. Today BTC bull run causing ADA/BTC drop so it could be a good timing to acquire some if you are interested.
