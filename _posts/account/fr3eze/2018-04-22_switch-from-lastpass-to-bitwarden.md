I starting to get more paranoid on my presence on the Internet, maybe this is the direct effect that making cryptocurrency one of my biggest investment so far. I value privacy more, I question everything that is centralised. 

Lastpass is my first password manager since a few years ago. It helps me to manage all the old and new password and auto-fill it whenever I log in a webpage. I mainly use it on the PC only for free while mobile app requires subscribing to their paid service which I don't feel like to. Lastpass serves me well and despite some minor issues. 

# Lastpass to Bitwarden
After some researches, I decided to change from Lastpass to [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) for some obvious reasons:

- Lastpass is a highly commercialised product and was [acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/09/logmein-acquires-password-management-software-lastpass-for-110-million/) previously. I don't like the idea making a profit on user data while the users have no share in the deal. Also, a commercialised product usually values profit more than security.

- Lastpass is closed source that no one knows what they are doing with user's password behind. Although Bitwarden is the hosted service, they are open source and anyone can review their code anytime. 

- Bitwarden is free for all platforms and doesn't unnecessarily cripple the free plan while you can surely enjoy more features in the $10/year premium plan.

Follow this [guide](https://help.bitwarden.com/article/import-from-lastpass/) to import credential from Lastpass to Bitwarden. 

# Cross-platform, for free

Bitwarden is quite new in the password management industry but the open source and web-host mechanism make it on the of most popular choices for the best of security and convenience. It supports a wide range of application from the OS level of Windows, Linux and Mac to the mobile system Android and iOS, support in browser extensions are amazing as well.

Crypto-backed browser Brave is on the list, cool! 

Bitwarden has many more to offer over Lastpass, and most of them are for free and better! I will start exploring all the features it got and if the reviews I've read were all true, there will be no reason I should opt for another password manager again.

**What password manager you are using?**
