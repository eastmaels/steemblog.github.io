Hey Japan!

Finally got the chance to visit this amazing country, things got really different compared to the time when I added *Trip to Japan* in my bucket list. The biggest plot was the rise of cryptocurrency and Japan just happens to be the most crypto-friendly country in the world. And I happens to be a big time crypto fan as well.

Prior to this trip, I did a little research on which cryptocurrency is is widely transacted in the Japanese society but to no avail. Will it be the mainstream BTC or ETH? Or the made-in-Japan Monacoin? We shall see.

Anyhow, I'm not willing to spend my crypto as I still treat them as investment rather than a payment method. So I arrived with a 0 balance crypto wallet in my phone.

Let's see what you got Japan!

终于抵达了久违的日本！

今日的日本和当初我向往的已经有了很大的不同，最大的原因就是加密货币的崛起。而日本刚巧也是货币的最大拥护者，这对我这种币迷来说简直就是胜地！

不知道这里流行的货币是什么呢？主流的 BTC ETH？还是日本的猫猫币 Monacoin？在网上都找不到答案，就让我们拭目以待吧！
