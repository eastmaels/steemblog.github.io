Living in the virtual crypto world too long and sometimes we forget the actual purpose of cryptocurrencies, <strong>to actually use it for buying services or products.</strong>

I've been participating in the space for mlre than a year now. Other than coin-to-coin trading, is the list of things that I've purchased  via coins, mainly in Steem of course:

<ul>
<li><strong>VPS service from @privex.</strong> I'm on the most basic 8 USD plan for the third month and I must say I'm a happy customer with the server's stability. This service is priced at USD but converted to crypto amount during checkout. They only receive crypto such as BTC, LTC, STEEM/SBD.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Burger, the real edible burger!</strong> Absolutely amazing feeling feeding my stomach with some virtual digital STEEM! If you ever bought food using crypto you will know what I'm talking about: https://steemit.com/steem/@fr3eze/feeding-my-stomach-with-steem-for-the-first-time</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Graphic design service for a logo</strong>. I managed to hunt down a talented designer @ggabogarcia to design a complete Steem profile for my sub account @zocken which is focusing on sharing gaming content. <a href="https://steemit.com/steempress/@fr3eze/awesomelogodesigneronsteem-td0w4vo0tm">This is how I did it</a> and you may proceed to the @zocken for to see the result for yourselve. Paying SBD for awesome service like this feels unreal indeed!</p></li>
<li><p>Paid for food a couple of time after Steem meet-up with SBD. Things has became easier if the group have something in common to believe. One person settle the bill for the table with credit card, and the rest pays him with STEEM/SBD. Simple as that.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bought a Trezor hardware wallet</strong> with BTC This is literally my first time of paying crypto for physical product for the first time. Though I spend the precious BTC right before the boom of December 2017, that was a pleasure shopping experience.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Guess I have been paying STEEM for more stuff such as buying virtual items like SteemMonster card packs and playing dice games in the SteemDice. Both are purely for entertainment purpose so I would not rather count them as buying real value product with the money.

All in all, it feels great and practical to be able to actually spend the coins I'm earning everyday. This alone spells the greatest value of a cryptocurrency to me and I shall keep looking for new ways for its usage.

<center><strong>What had you bought with crypto?</strong></center>

<hr />

<strong>TLDR:</strong> Paid VPS, burger, graphic design service and a couples of other stuff using STEEM/SBD and it feels great.

<strong>太长没读：</strong> 这些日子，用过 STEEM/SBD 买了 VPS，logo 设计服务，食物等等真实世界的东西，感觉好极了。你有买过什么吗？
