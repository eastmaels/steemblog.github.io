I was late 2 days to learn this new exciting service by Google called Stadia. It is basically a gaming platform which all the infrastructure built in own data center and stream the live gaming to gamers remotely. Thus gamers can play any supported graphic demanding games on local low-end machine like PC, tablet, phone and even TV.

The whole point is to eliminate the need of purchasing powerful and costly hardware in order for a top notch gaming performance. Goolge has it all for you, get the internet ready and you are good to go. I suppose it would be base on subscription model, or the famous pay-or-watching-ads model.

Interestingly, I know a crypto project name [Playkey](https://welcome.playkey.net/en/lp/eu-quiz-before/)(introduced by @culgin) offers the same  service but it is decentralized obviously. I have no experience in both services and at this point of time I'm just too afraid to predict who will be the final winner, what do you think? <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/google-stadia-is-going-to-make-you-sell-your-expensive-gpu-away-soon/ </em><hr/></center>
