If you are not aware, Andreas M. Antonopoulos @aantonop has already landed on Steem! This is his first post "[The "real" aantonop](https://steemit.com/impersonators/@aantonop/the-real-aantonop)" for public verification.

>Andreas M. Antonopoulos is a technologist and serial entrepreneur who has become one of the most well-known and well-respected figures in bitcoin.

He is my most respected figure in the crypto space. His educational video on Youtube and books have educated me so much. **One thing that separates Andreas from the rest of Bitcoin public figure, that he never discusses the price but always focusing on the fundamental knowledge in laymen term.**

He is also the author of *Mastering Bitcoin* and *The Internet of Money* which I regard the latter as the Bible of cryptocurrency. A very good read to all the crypto lover. Without his help, I couldn't possibly build up a solid faith about blockchain but become the dumb money who always speculating on the crypto prices.

Not sure he would actively participate in Steem as he just started with a single post, but anyhow this is a great start! And his first post already scored hundreds of votes and worth thousands of dollar now, apparently many whales in Steem has been benefited by his influence.

Make sure you check follow him and check him out for more!

后知后觉的我，才发现原来昨天 Andreas M.Antonopoulos @aantonop 已经正式登陆 Steem 啦！这是他发布的第一个自我认证贴子，毕竟仿冒者太多了：[The "real" aantonop](https://steemit.com/impersonators/@aantonop/the-real-aantonop)

如果你不知道这号人物，**他一个电脑技术专家，也是比特币圈里最知名的公众人物**。也是我最尊崇的区块链人物，没有之一。

他和众多所谓比特币或是区块链知名人物最大的不同就是，他从来不把焦点放在价格上。他众多的讲座和书籍讨论跟更多的是背后的技术，也就是区块链，讨论从古至今钱币的角色转变，和这项新科技将如何颠覆现在和未来。角度新颖，有条有理，尤其是他所著作的 《The Internet of Money》更是让人看得拍案叫绝，我管它叫*比特币的圣经*。

总之，没有他的帮助我就不会对区块链有现在如此深刻的了解和信心，只怕也会沦为市场上追涨杀跌的韭菜。这样大神般的人物登陆了，不 follow 一下还像话吗？
