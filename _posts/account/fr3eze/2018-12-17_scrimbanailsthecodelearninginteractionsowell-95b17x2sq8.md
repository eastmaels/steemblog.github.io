It has come to the stage that I have to pick up some real coding shit to make my project frontend a reality. While I love the idea of coding which always looks like a real-life superpower to make anything possible, I often find myself not really a good coder whenever trying to dive deep in it. That is also the biggest reason I found [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) such an amazing web designing tool.

However, the project I'm working on is more than just a static page and that web development skills are necessary for the process. I've learned that Javascript frameworks like Angular, React and Vue has been really hot among the web dev circle and the great thing about those frameworks is that they aim to greatly simplify the complex frontend coding process.

Decided to go with **Vue** for its lightweight design and the relatively flat learning curve compared to Angular and React, I've found [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) a really fun and interesting project to make code learning a fun process.

> Scrimba is a powerful new way of learning code. Play around with the instructor's code any time, right in the player.

Scrimba is a rather young project which you can find all of the tutorials are web related like HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Javascript frameworks, and so on.

Scrimba is making the code learning process to another level in term of user interaction. Basically, all tutorial are playing full screen in the mode of text editor view where you can see the cursor moving around and coding happen real time while the tutor explaining it. Pretty much like watching a Youtube video. But wait, the real magic starts when you paused that *video*. Users get to edit the code and the built-in browser will show result real time as if you were doing the same thing with a real text editor and test with a real browser. Except with Scrimba, **everything is included in a single page.**

When users have done messing around with the code, resume the *video* and the tutorial will starts from where it stopped and erases all the user's changes. Users can pause the tutorial anytime when they feel like playing around with whatever code to understand the concept better. This has made the learning process as fun as it could be. Personally, I think this very fascinating!

Hopefully, they would add more tutorials to the Vue as it as relatively younger than the big brother Angular and React. Happy coding!
