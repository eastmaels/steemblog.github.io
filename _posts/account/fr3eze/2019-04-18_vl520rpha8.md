I have a great suggest to media streaming site like YouTube, sort the Views in term of years. Like 2017: 1,999,888 views, 2018: 333,111 views and so on. Make it notiveable and real time of course. I'm sick of looking at people comments on old videos in the format of "Still listening in 2019." "It's 2019, and I'm STILL HERE! WHO ELSE?!?" "2019 anyone?". Providing a year-based views is the best solution these people are seeking for.

Or this is just another cool trick to gain likes? <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/642-2/ </em><hr/></center>
