> Dear fr3eze,
Congratulations on your outstanding performance in Cindicator’s February 2018 competition! You ranked #103 with 1517 points in the crypto markets challenge and #5181 with 0 points in the traditional markets challenge, earning you a total of 0.02104335 ETH across both ratings.

Yep, the result was **0.02104335 ETH** (roughly 18 USD) for a #103 rank last month.

They also attached a [public google sheet for Cindicator February report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10RIbMROJ1w-2lv9wk4wBslaZdNS2DIqBb3dtOA_dE_E/edit#gid=557457248), take a look there if you ever took part in predicting. There are over 10,000 predictors in the Crypto market, feels great that I could be ranked at that high!

I know, 0.02 ETH seems too little for the all the efforts, it depends on how you look at it. I spent not more than 5 minutes every day on the prediction and it is not taxing at all. The total prize is only worth of 1.25 BTC for thousand participants to share. Don't expect a handsome return if you are not in the [top 10 list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10RIbMROJ1w-2lv9wk4wBslaZdNS2DIqBb3dtOA_dE_E/edit#gid=557457248), where they averagely receive 0.3 ETH.

## There is some bonus too

>By placing #103 in one of the challenges you have also gained access to the Cindicator Bot for one month on the Beginner plan.

I also earn an one-month access to Beginner plan which normally will need a minimum possession of 5,000 CND. Beginner plan allows the user to access some of the processed indicators to both crypto and traditional market so it can be treated as a trading signal as well. This alone could be more valuable than the 0.02 ETH prize money. [Except I already entitled to this exact plan](/crypto/@fr3eze/use-cindicator-bot-to-access-the-wisdom-of-crowd). But not bad for a bonus too.

## Will I keep predicting in Cindicator?

Why not? But it might not purely for the prize. I found that the satisfaction from predicted something accurately is very rewarding as well. And knowing that I did a pretty good job in market analysis is something I never expected as well.

上次分享的 [Cindicator](/crypto/@fr3eze/cindicator-another-undervalued-and-strong-project-like-old-day-s-steem) 市场预测二月份成绩终于出炉啦。在超过十千位参与者里很意外的我排名 #103，还真的很好运啊。那么这么高的排名能得到的分红有多少呢？

答案是 0.02104335 ETH (约为 18 USD)。

我知道你心里在说很少，说真的是有点少啦。但从另一个角度出发，我每天画不超过五分钟的时间在上面，实在是玩一场手机游戏花的时间都多过这个。而且除了 0.02 ETH 我还可以免费使用“初级配套” 一个月来查看经过处理的信号，这个通常要有 5000 CND 才可以解锁，[当然我是已经有了](/crypto/@fr3eze/use-cindicator-bot-to-access-the-wisdom-of-crowd)。对于没有的人来说还是很不错的。

我会继续参与预测，但可能就不是为了钱了，毕竟在这写文的收入来得更容易。当做小游戏来玩把，追求成功预测某些东西的成就感也是很不错的。
