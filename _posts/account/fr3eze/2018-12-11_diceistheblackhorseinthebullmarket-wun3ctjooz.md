Since the last sold off of my all DICE holding and some disappointing loses, I rarely visit the site for a few days and it was very surprising to find our the DICE price has once shoot up to 0.0064 EOS/DICE. Zooming out the graph and the chart pattern looks very familiar isn't it? Looks exactly like the 2017 BTC or the whole crypto market. I'm not implying the DICE price is gonna fall soon but it is really interesting to see how people keep gambling despite how the market is doing. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/dice-is-the-black-horse-in-the-bull-market/ </em><hr/></center>
