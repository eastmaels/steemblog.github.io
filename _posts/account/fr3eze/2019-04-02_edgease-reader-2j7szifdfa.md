Microsoft Edge might not be the most used default browser including me, but it's speed is second to none. The design and looks is a lot more sleeker and clean compared to FF and Chrome. Or probably I just getting too used to the latter browsers.

Edge has the ability to open up <strong>EPUB</strong> and serves as e-reader which most browsers are not capable of. I personally find this very handy especially Windows doesn't come with a native option. I had a pretty good experience using Edge and would have use it more if it has a more matured extension support from the dev. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/edge-as-e-reader/ </em><hr/></center>
