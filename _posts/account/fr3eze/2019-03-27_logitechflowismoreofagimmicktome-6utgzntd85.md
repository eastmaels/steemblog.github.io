I bought the Logitech Anywhere 2s mouse months ago for the overwhelming review and ultra-lasting  battery life. Both are living up to my expectation but I always doubt the usefulness of their <em>killer feature</em>, Flow. Flow is the ability to share a same mouse and mouse cursor between 2 different system, so one mouse will be able to work simultaneously.

Today I found a need to transfer a file from my Windows PC to the MacBook, instead of going the usual cloud storage or other file sharing method. I've decided to set up the Flow and give it a try. Turned out it wouldn't work because the PC is on LAN network and MacBook is on WiFi. Both have to be strictly on the same network wired or wireless.

It obviously not worth the effort switching my PC to WiFi and furthermore, it is only LAN enabled. Switching to different network on and off defeat the purpose of Flow, which is making the user life easier. The good thing is this mouse was never bought for this gimmicky feature, and this attempt to use it has just confirmed it.

That is still a great wireless mouse though. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/logitech-flow-is-more-of-a-gimmick-to-me/ </em><hr/></center>
