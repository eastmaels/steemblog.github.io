I've been using this local telco for almost 2 years. It started as a really competitive and was the best dealer that offered most value mobile package in town. I was a happy customer until the other service providers start to pick up. Back then it was standard for package like 3GB per $30 monthly or so, the appearance of my current telco raised the competition to something around 8GB per $28 monthly so that's more than 100% increase in data quota with the same price.

Obviously they are doing too well that other competitors start to match their package, and the GB/dollar offer has been increasing like never before. My current telco obviously has to update their package to lure more new sign-up for the sake of sale. <strong>But only limited to new sign-up</strong>. I don't get how they found the logic is acceptable to ignore existing customer who already shows valid support. I've to file a complaint to the company and filled up some form just to get myself <em>upgraded</em> to the latest package.

I mean, shouldn't this be done automatically for all existing customers before you are offering better deals to new comers?

目前的手机流量配套服务商频频为了跟上市场的竞争，而推出更优惠的配套。本来服务商相互之间的竞争会带来更高价值的配套，对消费者是最好不过了。但是我所用的服务商，推出的新配套居然只局限于新用户，那就未免令现有用户（我）非常恼火了。推陈出新招揽新用户未可厚非，但为何要置那些已经证明了实质支持的现有客户于不顾呢？而这是不是变相鼓励现有用户跳出去再回来当个“新用户”好享用新配套？

这样的商业逻辑实在令人不敢恭维。 <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/new-user-existing-user/ </em><hr/></center>
