One of the first things that I learnt about Steem is the ambition to replace social and content creating site like <strong>Reddit</strong>, and that excited me very much since I know how powerful the community is from Reddit Except it did not come true and Steem is still merely a subset of Reddit, or <em>subreddit</em> technically(sadly).

<h2>Most powerful resource of opinions</h2>

Over the years, I've developed a habit whenever I need opinions on anything, I fire a Google search with a query like "reddit what is the best ...". Chances are there are at least a couple of threads discussing exactly the same topic, or even better that there is a subreddit community made for the very topic specifically.

What is the best tool for xxx? Product A vs product B? Is xxx reliable? Review of some random shits? You might be amused sometimes how deep people over there can go on a simple question, and most of the response feels real and quality. I often find myself spending too much time on a single thread that is full with thoughtful discussion and can't help to stop reading all of it.

This is everything I need Steem to be since the announcement of Hivemind development but I guess we won't see the release anytime soon. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/can-we-see-the-day-when-steem-is-the-new-reddit/ </em><hr/></center>
