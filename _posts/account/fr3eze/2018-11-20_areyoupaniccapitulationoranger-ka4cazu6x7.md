Deep dive of the crypto market is inspiring. The brutal 20% crash of overall market cap make me thinking deep again for my self-claim status as a brainless Hodler. I wasn't as brainless as I thought especially when everything was on a raging bull, right?

Interestingly, the famous Wall St. Cheat Sheet start to appear around the Internet these two days.

And if you notice, we often found this kind of emotion analysis stuff when things are going south but see none when everything was booming. Because people were so busy picking the money up from the street and the good feeling tends to trick the brain that the upward trend is going to last forever. Exactly what I was going through the last 2017 crazy bull.

Steem has officially halved my entry point which was $0.90 one year ago. I'm expecting a $0.10 and I really wonder how my news feed will look like by the time.

Hold tight my friends. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/are-you-panic-capitulation-or-anger/ </em><hr/></center>
