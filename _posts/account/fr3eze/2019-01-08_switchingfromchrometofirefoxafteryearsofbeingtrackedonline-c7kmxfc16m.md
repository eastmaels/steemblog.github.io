Ashamed of myself to learn that the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> is a non-porfit organization after all my time spent online for years. Maybe the neatness and sleekness of the browser itself make me think it does not look like something created by a not profit-oriented company.

As I dived deeper into the idea of digital privacy and anonymity, there are lots of useful tools and tricks could enhance those important aspect average users used to ignore. <strong>Browser</strong> is probably the best place to start within the process of strengthening privacy. Have a good read here: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/privacy-security/">A Healthy Internet is Secure and Private</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/">Firefox Privacy Notice</a>.

<ul>
<li>Firefox is <strong>open source</strong> and deployed by the <strong>non-profit</strong> Mozilla Foundation.</li>
<li>Firefox is more <strong>lightweight</strong> than the memory monster Chrome.</li>
<li>Firefox is built with privacy protection in mind.</li>
<li>Firefox has no tracker built-in as Chromium browser do.</li>
<li>Firefox is fully-customizable.</li>
<li>Firefox <em>Private Window</em> makes Chrome's <em>Incognito mode</em> looks like a joke.</li>
</ul>

While Firefox is a great browser with a clean base to start working on enhancing privacy, it needs to be hardened by a series of configuration for the best result. This is a <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/#addons">list</a> of must-have privacy add-ons like the <em>uBlock Origin</em>, * HTTPS Everywhere*, <em>NoScript</em> and etc.

Surprisingly, I found the switching the from Chrome to Firefox as I can find most of the extension I cannot live without easily on Firefox, import the bookmarks and boom. Transition completed!
