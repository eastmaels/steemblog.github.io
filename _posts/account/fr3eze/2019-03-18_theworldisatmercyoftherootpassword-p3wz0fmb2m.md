  "To err is human; to really screw up requires the root password."

Probably this is the only time I laughed that hard reading a technical book.

In the early days of my sysadmin career, I always failed to see why is the need for <code>sudo</code> since we can just <code>su root</code> to enter full root user mode and do whatever we want without typing the password every time. Now I see the point, after washed by some real site working experience. God bless that I never bring the site down yet.

Annoyance caused by <code>sudo</code> is exactly the purpose of this command. It prompt user that he is going to do something that might be destructive thus the decision might be considered again. Also, allowing a user working freely with the highest root permission is never a good idea in a working environment. I should stick with <code>sudo</code> more from now on. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/the-world-is-at-mercy-of-the-root-password/ </em><hr/></center>
