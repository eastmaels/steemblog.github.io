There are some buildings in the Yangjiabu village topped their roof with dried plants. Not sure what is the name of it. Each of the roof have a thick layer and I guess they works great in expeling the rain at the same time very lighweight that might reduce the burden of the building stucture.

杨家埠里有好些建筑都是用这类的茅草作为屋顶，什么品种则不得而知。每个屋顶都厚厚的铺上好几层，看起来却工整而毫不杂乱。我猜想它们的排水效果应该很不错，同时轻盈的重量给房子减去了不少负担。

If you have noticed the inversed U shape at the edge of roof, every grass rooftop has them. They seems like made by cement. In my opinion they are used to act as weight to press down the light grass and the U shape is not to block the exit of water coming from the top.

Brilliant design and looks great too.

如果你也注意到了屋顶边缘的倒 U 型的形状，每个茅草屋顶都有它们，看起来是用水泥造成的。我想，除了可以作为重量把轻飘飘的茅草屋顶压住之外，倒 U 型的设计也提供了排水的空间。

古人的智慧真不容小觑。
