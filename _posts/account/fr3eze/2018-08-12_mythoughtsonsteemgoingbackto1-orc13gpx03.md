<h2>The trip from bottom to top, back to bottom.</h2>

It's been one year to finally see Steem price back to the $1 level which was the entry point when I first knew this awesome space and decided to topup the SP using real cold cash.

It was around July and I remember right after that period, everything was starting to grow. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Dogecoin, shitcoins. The massive bull is having a great run. Cryptocurrency is a money printing machine for the late 2017, only if you know when to pull it off and sell for profit.

I've pulled some friends into Steem. Few remains, most left. I used to brag to them who listened to my advice buying some Steem while it was still <em>cheap</em>(around $1), because for the past year from now the price was averagely above 1 dollar.

Here we are again, back to my entry price point. I did not even once withdrawing a single Steem/SBD out fo the system so I would not claim myself as a successful investor on Steem as the capital gain back to square now.

<h2>What do I see Steem as a product as a whole now?</h2>

I felt absolutely nothing about the price dipping to be honest. Despite many drawbacks Steem is having now. Like the subpar Steemit website design, whale problem, curation&lt;everything else, and so on(maybe I should make a list next time).

I still have a strong faith in this project for one reason. The active and intelligent crowd on Steem is something I've never seen before in other crypto space(or maybe I did not explore enough yet), excellent tech advantage granted by the Graphene, are the best combo to boost my confidence holding Steem. In fact, I'm in the progress of building my first Daps on Steem, more on that on when it is ready to release.

All in all, do I bother the price dipping? Not at all.

Will I still be active here? Absolutely.<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/my-thoughts-on-steem-going-back-to-1/</em><hr/></center>
