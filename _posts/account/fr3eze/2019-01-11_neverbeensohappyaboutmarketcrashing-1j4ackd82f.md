Nothing excites me more than the market crash this morning. It went from 138B and ended up steady around 123B level, a 10% loss within one day.

Such market crash impacted me positively for only one obvious reason, <strong>that is I'm waiting for a nice entry point to top up my faith in the great Crypto.</strong> My local exchange will not honour my fiat deposit on the same day when the market was last hovering around 122B last December, by the time the fund was in, the market somehow started to bull a little bit over 130B.

I was quite pissed for a while actually. Since then the last thing I want to see on the CMC was the all-green page that everything is surging. Damn, I'm glad that I've developed that <em>buy low</em> mindset after all the FOMO lesson 2018 has taught me.

When you have strong faith in something valuable, nothing is more exciting to see the price fall hard. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/never-been-so-happy-about-market-crashing/ </em><hr/></center>
