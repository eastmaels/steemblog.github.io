<a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/V/">GTA5</a> sometimes just popped up some funny yet inspiring quote from the characters inside the virtual world. And I learnt this new phrase today while going on a mission kidnapping some random guy in the great Sunday morning.

<h2>"You gotta speculate to accumulate, dawg."</h2>

Wow, such a gold. This sentence not only hitting the rhyme but make a big deal of sense to me too. It actually sounds quite alike with another popular saying like <strong>"No pain no gain"</strong> or <strong>"Nothing ventured, nothing gained"</strong>.

This is basically what I'm believing in at the current stage not having any overwhelming commitment like a house mortgage to bear or a kid to feed. And this is the biggest motive that drives me to hold most of my net worth in the ultra-volatile crypto as well.

<h2>Not everyone favors in this way of accumulating.</h2>

<em>Go big or go home</em> is just not the thing for most the people. There is a safer and steady way to accumulate. Get a good grade in the school so that you can find a good paying job, save up the cigarette money so that you can afford the Ferrari in 20 years.

Hmmm, I'm just too impatient and aggressive for the slow approach I guess.

How do you accumulate?<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/interesting-quote-from-a-game/</em><hr/></center>
