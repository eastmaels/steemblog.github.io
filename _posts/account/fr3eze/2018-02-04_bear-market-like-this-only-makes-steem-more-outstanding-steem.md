I stopped trading altcoins for almost a month now. Why? Because all the altcoins are at a deep loss as most of them were last traded when the total market cap was at 800B. I'm not panic nor worry about this situation as I knew this could happen prior to doing those trades. All this bear market means to me is that I could take a short break until the market is recovered. 

And I have a list of altcoins that I believe will have a long-term value, I put them into private wallets and do not trade them at all. They serve as a long-term investment asset to me. Value of that list plunged of course with the market. There is nothing I can do about it other than waiting for the bear out of the market.

###  Steem, however, still providing value to me no matter how the market does

I've been on this platform for more than 5 months, writing something every day on it has already become part of my routine. Started when Steem was at $1, been to ATH $8, still continue my journey at current $4. No matter how bad is the crypto market now, my investment in Steem keeps generating income non-stop.

- Everyone still got the free 20% Voting Power to spend, combined with SP, this outputs wealth.
- I still got curation reward by participating in other's posts.
- I still got author reward by creating contents and commenting.
- My Stemm Power still receiving *dividend* by Steem inflation.

Even better, **I got more SP in reward as Steem price went down** recently. 

I believe **Time is the best touchstone for a coin's value**. A great coin/project must be able to deliver despite bear or bull market, like a self-sustaining machine. I'm glad that Big bear market like this makes me realized Steem is way more durable and profitable than expected. 

Keep creating!

已经停止交易货币近一个月了，原因很简单，那就是因为市场这一阵子的大跌把全部货币套住了。我其实是不慌的，这样的情况之前也不是没遇到过，只是这次熊市似乎维持更久。再者，交易之前当然也知道这样的情况一定会发生，所以也不存在 panic sell 的情形，当放个小假等市场回复吧。

在众多我长期持有的货币当中，Steem 在这时就显出威力了。

**因为在这样的大熊市，Steem 依然不断的为我创造价值。**

- 每天自动回复的 20% Voting power 再加上 Steem Power 就是源源不绝的财富输出。
- 我依然从评论和文章中赚取作者奖励。
- 我依然从从点赞别人的文中赚取 Curation 奖励。
- 我的 Steem Power 依然每天根据 Steem 区块链的通膨而得到分红。

更好的是，**在 Steem 低价的现在我所能得到的 SP 奖励更多了**。所谓*路遥知马力*，真正验证一个币的实力就是时间。而 Steem 充分展现了**无论在牛市还是熊市都可以同样产生价值**的属性!
