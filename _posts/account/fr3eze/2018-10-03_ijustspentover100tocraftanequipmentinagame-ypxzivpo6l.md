EOS Knight has been my daily mobile game after quitting my last mobile gaming addict. I regard the mobile gaming is one of the worst habits to waste time, but the good thing about EOS knight is that I actually don't have to spend a lot of time on it due to its idle gaming mechanism.

To me, the motivation of playing this game is pure<strong>making some EOS</strong> so the marketplace for materials and equipment is my main focus.

<h2>The game recently introduced a new update</h2>

Hitting over 700 floors now will allow players to <strong>sell 4 items at the same times</strong> which is 1 item more than the previous limit. Definitely sounds interesting for a heavy trader like myself.

I've been staying at 500+ floors for quite a while and kind of making back all my initial EOS. It is the right time to go for a higher floor, at least beyond the 700 ceiling. I'm ready to splash those EOS again!

<h2>Made my most powerful equipment</h2>

The only way to achieve that is upgrade equipment of knight so they can either deal more damage or staying alive longer. Long story short, I made a new armour<strong>Mare Tranquilitatis</strong> which happens to be the most powerful item in my collection.

The item is 90% done and here is the plan that is going to be completed anyhow: Make 16 same items and synthesise them all together into one for max levelling it to Level 5.

And the breakdown of cost is: 
- About 1 EOS / Item
- About 3 EOS for the cost of Magic water which acts like the <em>fee</em> for such operation

<code>(1 * 16) + 3 = 19 EOS</code>

At the time of writing, 1 EOS = $5.59 which make the item cost about <strong>$106.21</strong>. Oh my Fxxking God. This alone will tops all my game spending record combined!

<h2>It is my most expensive spending in a damn game so far</h2>

To be honest, I'm not even mad. I was fascinated by this fact and I did not realize the actual cost while I was busy crafting the item. It works like charm though and does what it does to bring my game to another level. And in fact I could just sell it away at the same cost price at least(it is a damn fine item anyway). While I do not regret crafting expensive item as such, this is a whopping price to pay though.

The lesson of this post is, gaming using crypto could be dangerous as betting in the casino with chip. <strong>Players often ignore the actual value of the token</strong>. We often treat one chip as one unit despite the actual value it carries no matter it worth $5 or $100 a piece.

And that explains very well in my case as <strong>I calculated the value in term of EOS</strong> instead of converting them to the daily updated price at CMC before making a decision. Which would anyhow make the game a lot more troublesome to play with right?

While this powerful and sexy amour starts to show, I hope the value would retain more or less the same in the market by the time I decided to let it go. Else it would be a huge loss, ouch!
