Months ago when a Bitcoin was still under $2000, most of us still manage to buy one or at least a big portion of a single Bitcoin with our monthly income. Now with the whopping $11,000 price tag, Bitcoin is getting further from the reach of ordinary people. 

If you still hold the one Bitcoin you bought during the day when it was so still affordable, good. However, no matter how high the price goes, you always still holding the same one Bitcoin. What are the possible ways to increase your BTC holding as it is getting out of your league every day?

- **Mine Bitcoin or join cloud mining company**

  I'm not interested in mining considering the high risk of costs. The profitability of mining is decreasing every day too. Maybe you can mine for altcoins and trade it for Bitcoin too.

- **Join Bitcoin giveaway event or high-yield investment programs**

  Best way to waste your time and risks your fund IMO. 

- **Keep earning the way you are and buy more Bitcoin**

  This is the slowest way especially BTC is getting more expensive.

- **Increase your income and buy more Bitcoin**

  Works multiple jobs, starts a business, or even hits a jackpot can bring you extra wealth and bring more buying power. But it could be hard to compete when the BTC goes bullish.

- **Trade altcoins with Bitcoin, profitably.**

  This may be the fastest way to increase Bitcoin amount, if you can do it *PROFITABLY*, of course. Else this could be a great way to lose your one and only Bitcoin, too bad. If you are no expert but still want to give it a try, maybe you can [start trading in small amount following signal channels](https://steemit.com/trading/@fr3eze/experience-sharing-with-a-profitable-trading).

To the moon!

数个月前当比特币还是低于 $2000 时，多数人还是有能力起码买到或是一个比特币的。但是以现在疯狂的 $11,000 价位，买一个比特币的理想似乎离普通人越来越远了。

如果你还持着当初廉价买来的一个比特币，恭喜你。但是无论价钱升的多高，一个比特币始终是一个。在价钱日渐高不可攀的今日，有什么方法可以增加持有量呢？

- **自行挖矿或云端挖矿**

  我对挖矿不是很有兴趣，主要是因为成本风险太高，收益效应每一天也在降低。但或许可以考虑去挖别的币种来换成比特币。

- **参加比特币免费派送活动或是高收益投资项目（HYIP）**

  浪费时间和亏钱的最佳方法。

- **以现有的收入继续入手比特币**

  要是比特币持续这种涨势，这是最慢的方法。

- **增加收入来购买比特币**

  身兼数职，开始经商，甚至是中大彩都可以带来额外的财富从而有能力入手大量比特币。但是收入的增长速度要跟上疯牛般的比特币，似乎有点难度。

- **在加密货币市场中交易**

  这是最快增加比特币的方法，前提是你要*有本事从险恶的市场中有稳定的发挥*。~~似乎有点废话啊。~~当然这也可以是让你丢光你仅有的比特币的最佳途径。但要是你有兴趣尝试同时又不是高手，或许[可以考虑拿出一小部分根据 Signal 频道的信息来交易](https://steemit.com/trading/@fr3eze/experience-sharing-with-a-profitable-trading)。

比特币，勇往直前吧!
