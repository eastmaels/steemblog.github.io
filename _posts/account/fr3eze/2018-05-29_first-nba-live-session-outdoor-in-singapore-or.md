The game 7 of NBA western conference final falling on the Wesak Day which is the public holiday here in SG is probably one of the luckiest things that happen to this week. To make things even better， we found sport bar which would broadcast the whole game in town!

This is my first time watching a NBA live game with my own basketball friends and a whole bunch of strangers. You have to understand that NBA in Asia countries like Malaysia and Singapore is still far less than a big event like the football. Credit to the genius @jessie901220 to find such a great place. Nothing is funnier to watch a NBA game with the company of people who share the same interest.

I would say I had a great time there. They are numerous of big TVs(60 or 70 inch, I'm not sure) installed at different angles streaming the same game with great resolution. The audience definitely can find a suitable spot for a comforatble viewing experience. But the only drawback is, their breakfast set with bacon burger sucks. Do not order that.

And this is why I'm not streaming the game today. Sorry if some of you are waiting for one.

Back to the game itself, nothing surprise and well within my expectation. You won't be thinking the Rockets with one superstar less can even beat the full healthy team of Warriors.

Same storyline as the last Game 6, Rockets led the pace in both offence and defence for the first two quarters. After the half-time break, Warriors slowly getting their hand hot and splash brothers start hitting crzy three pointers. Rockets trailing and the point defference getting bigger til the end of game. The *3rd quarter Warriors* is the most explosive Warriors for real.

Few things to note on the Rockets side, James Harden is just as childish as always and I can tell that by a several small incidents. He rejects the helping hand from Green who was trying to pull him up from the floor. He too get the locker room the first moment after the loss without congratulating the winners.

<center>A joke for the good evening. Enjoy.</center>

Call it competitive nature or just narrow-minded, this is a complete sign of lacking sportsmanship at all to me. Rockets will not go far with a leader as such. Would you mind to take a look at the other James at the East side please, Mr. Harden?

Can't wait for the first game of NBA Finals, though the match-up has been the same for last 3 years, LOL.

这是我第一次在户外和球友们一起看 NBA 直播。 最完美的事情就是西部抢七大战竟然落在公共假期之余，还让我们的天才 @jessie901220 找到一个[运动吧](http://www.boomarang.com.sg/contact/)居然有直播服务。店里配置了许多个大屏幕，顾客们在各种角度都可以舒服的观赏比赛，实在给力。想不到新加坡居然还有这种好地方！

今天比赛的结果也在预料之中，你不能期望放水了自家一个超级巨星还可以打赢对面全员健康的历史强队。比赛的进程也和上一场很相似，不就是火箭前两节态度强硬，打出了节奏和态度，更一度领先十几分。中场休息回来，传说中最强的*第三节*勇士出现了，水花兄弟开始进入状态连中几个高难度三分，再加上火箭防守慢慢崩溃，比赛也逐渐失去悬念。

值得担心的是，作为火箭的绝对骨干 James Harden，在比赛中的数个小细节表现出了一如既往的孩子气。比如拒绝 Green 伸出援手将之从地上拉起，比如比赛结束后直接返回更衣室而不是去向胜者道贺。你可以说是竞争精神，但在我看来都是满满的孩子气。如此缺乏运动精神的领袖是很难带领球队走得更远的。 

Harden 先生，可以学学对面东部的另一个 James 是如何做好一个超级球员的吗？
