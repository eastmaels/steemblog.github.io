Finally, I received my first indicator from Cindicator Bot, and the expectation from the crowd is not so enlightening. As the indicator suggests, **total market capitalization is 65% likely to fall below 400B at any time before Feb 28.**

What is it like to fall that hard?

Currently, we are at 550B according to coinmarketcap.com, **that would be at least a steep 33% crash** despite the market hasn't really recovered from the 800B to 500B correction.

Bitcoin could easily drop below $8000 with the same market dominance. Oh, I would suspect if I was dreaming to see Bitcoin that cheap again after so long.

From both emotional and rational perspective, I do not wish this to happen as I already bought the dip in this correction. Maybe I should change the strategy a little according to this scary indicator, after all [they are having 72% accuracy by far](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RfaltJX4xZcMbsaPhpOL1NCV-leGY3PdgrDB55qRCHg/edit?usp=sharing). Why not?

前天终于迎来了第一个市场信号，该问题如下

>加密货币总市值在二月二十八之前，有没有可能在任何一个时间点跌破 4000 亿美金？

而大众给出来的预测居然是 **65% 的概率会发生**。

跌破 4000 亿是怎样的概念？

以目前总市值 5500 亿而言，那会是个至少 33% 的大跌幅，而且还是在目前市场还没从上次的调整恢复过来的基础上。比特币以目前 34% 的市场占有率，那就是会跌破 $8000 大关。如果成真我一定会以为自己在做梦，毕竟上次看到这么*平廉*的价格可是上个世纪的事了。

从理性和感性的角度出发我都不希望这会成真，毕竟在这次调整已经把仅有的现金 Buy the dip 了。但基于 Cindicator 72% 的预测准确率，或许调整策略也是不错的选择。
