I was having a great time attending my gf team member's house warming plus Xmas party at the very nice timing. The night started out a little bit dull as I was the outsider in the crowd. Alcohol is always the best ice-breaking tool in the history of mankind. Not long after everyone had a cup or two, we find some common language among us, the atmosphere started to get warmer as the night grows.

However, if I were to suggest a way to bring people together, that works better than drinking, <strong>it has to be gambling.</strong>

Not everyone drinks, but I'm quite certain gambling is part of human nature. There are some people took an oath not to touch the betting games, even just for fun. Not that they don't like to gamble, but they are the rare race of human kind who has a strong discipline and conscious mind to acknowledge how additive and destructive gambling can be.

The leisure Texas Poker was starting with S$30 for every player. The Ante was just S$0.2 which is almost close to free compared to actual game outside. I lost focus once in a while in the games not just because it was a long day for me, but the betting amount was just under my adrenaline threshold. Nonetheless, I had a great game session with lots of mind tricks here and there. We shared some laughter, exchanging chips on temporary green poker layout.

I ended the night with a net winning of S$30, but It would still be a fun night without the win.

Do you gamble? <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/poker-night-on-the-xmas-eve/ </em><hr/></center>
