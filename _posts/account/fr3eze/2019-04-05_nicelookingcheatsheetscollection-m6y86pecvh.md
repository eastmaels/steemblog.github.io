I would say nowadays the designof cheatsheets for various tools have been one of the most important factors to attract users. <a href="https://devhints.io/">Rico's cheatsheets</a> has a really wide set of cheatsheet collection on GitHub. The cool thing about the project is, it really has a nice UI and layout. Much easier and attractive to read compared to the others.

The only drawback is that while the collection covers a huge variety of product and tools, the content richness and quality varies too. Some having solid content like the <a href="https://devhints.io/bash">Bash cheatsheet</a> while some you might just want to look in other places like the <a href="https://devhints.io/regexp">Regex</a>.

This is still a nice place to visit if you are looking for some eye-candy in the mid of development though. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/nice-looking-cheatsheets-collection/ </em><hr/></center>
