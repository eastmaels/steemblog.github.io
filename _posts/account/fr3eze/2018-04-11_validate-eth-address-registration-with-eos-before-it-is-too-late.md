Less than 60 days for EOS to end their one-year long ICO, no EOS token will be transferable and a snapshot will be taken at **01 June 2018**. The most important thing to do for investors is to make sure all the ETH address used to receive EOS is properly registered. Else after the 01 June snapshot all the EOS attached might be gone forever. 

If you invested in EOS and store it in your personal wallet but never register yet, you can follow this [guide](/eos/@sandwich/contributing-to-eos-token-sale-with-myetherwallet-and-contract-inner-workings) for MyEtherWallet, this [guide](https://support.exodus.io/article/690-how-do-i-register-my-eos-address-inside-exodus_) for Exodus wallet or the [official site](https://eos.io/) for doing so.

I've registered mine using MyEtherWallet months ago and now I'm getting paranoid as the end date of ICO getting closer because there is no clear way to validate the registration.

## Easiest way to validate EOS registration in MyEtherWallet

1. Open any ETH wallet in [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com).
2. `Select Existing Contract` selects `EOS Contribution` and click on Access.
3. Select `keys` in the bottom left dropdown menu.
4. Input ETH public address in the `address` and click `READ`
5. If the ETH address is registered, `string` should return with a EOS public address.

If you hold EOS tokens on Exchanges will have to trust their service as they should do the necessary steps to claim all EOS after the end date of ICO. Anyway I would recommend DIY as the **money in exchanges is not your money technically**.

Make sure also you have the valid EOS keypair(public and private key) properly stored for access to the EOS token after June. You can always perform new registration over the old one as it would be overwritten.
