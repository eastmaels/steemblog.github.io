>"We see bitcoin as a bit of a Ponzi scheme," David Gledhill, group chief information officer and head of group technology and operations at Development Bank of Singapore(DBS).

He also does not think that getting into the world of bitcoin will create a competitive advantage for the bank, mainly due to bitcoin inefficiency in term of expensive transaction fees recently.

It's a shame for a prominent figure in the biggest bank in Singapore will stand against bitcoin. Not sure though if he is the bitcoin or the blockchain technology. Maybe he has to say what he has to say for being in his position, after all the bitcoin was created with the motto "Unbank the bank". I'm a big believer in the blockchain, and currently the world has shown the same trust via bitcoin billions worth market cap. 

Of course bitcoin has its own problems to solve. Endless hardforks, ridiculously expensive fee, unbearable long transaction time, questionable scalability, and so on. Bitcoin has gained the largest market cap mainly because it was the first ever cryptocurrency being created. Many outsiders still regard the bitcoin as the signboard for the digital currency, while there are actually hundreds of better coins out there competing in the market.

Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme? Those who said this is either playing smart trying to scare away the uneducated, or being too dumb to be ignorant.

Bitcoin might not be the last one standing ten years later, but blockchain is here to stay for sure.

新加坡最大银行，DBS 的首席信息官 David Gledhill 早日发表对比特币的看法，说这不过是一场庞氏骗局，银行的运作并不会因为参与这项技术而获得有利优势，还顺带提了最近吓人的交易费用为例子。

一个银行界的巨头说出这样充满抗拒性的言语的确是很令人遗憾。也许他只是说出身处在他这般职位所应该说出的话，毕竟比特币就是带着干掉银行的目标而诞生。不是很确定他所反对者是比特币本身还是背后的区块链技术，我是区块链的信徒，世界也正把同样的信任反映在比特币价格身上。但这不代表比特币就是区块链，它之所以能够成为龙头的主要原因还是因为它是第一个出现在大众目光的加密货币，对很多外行人来说比特币甚至就是加密货币的同义词，殊不知还有很多更先进强大的币种正在市场里闪耀着。

诚然，比特币本身是存在很多问题。无止尽的硬分叉，贵得吓人的费用，极慢的交易时间，充满疑问的扩展性等。但说比特币是庞氏骗局？说这等话的人不是聪明得想阻吓蠢蠢欲动的普罗大众，就是愚蠢得真的认为比特币毫无作为。

比特币未必会在遥远的十年后屹立不倒，但是区块链技术一定会长存下去。
