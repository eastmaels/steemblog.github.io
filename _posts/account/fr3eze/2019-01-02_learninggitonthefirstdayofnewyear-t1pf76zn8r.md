I had a little experience dealing with Version Controlling tool in my day job and that is ClearCase by the IBM, but <strong>Git</strong> is something that I love to explore more since it is widely accepted in the world of developers. My little project with 3 team members collaboration allows(forces) me to pick this knowledge up or it would be a nightmare for me every time I need to pull or push stuff in and out the remote repository.

I won't try to do all the explanation here but there are a few really useful resources that helped me get started with the Git and I will list them down below.

<hr />

<h2>Git client - GitKraken</h2>

In fact, all the git client are usable no matter what remote repository service you are using from the GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and so on, as long as they are using Git as the backend. <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a> is one of the most well-known git clients that is reputable in the community. Cross-platform, nice UI, solid features. Personal version is free. Head over to the nicely done <a href="https://support.gitkraken.com/">tutorial</a> page if the interface is a little overwhelming.

<h2>Remote Git repository services</h2>

Overall, <strong>GitHub</strong> is the winner generally for its reputation and adoption(our dear Utopian recognize open source work on Github only). Easy to use, lots of support from all over the places for the super huge userbase, and the free <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Page</a> which allows the user to host any static page <strong>for free</strong> is one of the coolest features.

However, to make a private repository on Github is not a free service. I go with the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/dashboard/overview">Bitbucket</a>. Although it is not as straightforward as Github, it has the better UI and the designed workflow of Bitbucket will naturally push you to learn more about how Git works(and this is really inevitable) which leads us to the next section.

<h2>Git learning resources</h2>

As a total beginner, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud">Learn Git with Bitbucket Cloud</a> is a really great start to get the concept of version control using Git. Although it is using Bitbucket as the remote repository the tutorial content can actually apply to any other Git repository services. Together with all the beginner-friendly language and illustration, one should be able to pick up Git quickly.

If you wish to cut out all the BS and get straight to the point while a more technical guide is preferable, this <a href="https://blog.osteele.com/2008/05/my-git-workflow/">Oliver Steele Blog</a> is a perfect choice.

Yeah, basically there are cheat sheets for everything and they often come in handy. Pick up some quick reference for the commands from great sheets below:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf">Git Cheat Sheet - GitHub Professional Services</a>- by GitHub</li>
<li><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet">Git cheat sheet</a> - by Atlassian Bitbucket</li>
</ul>
