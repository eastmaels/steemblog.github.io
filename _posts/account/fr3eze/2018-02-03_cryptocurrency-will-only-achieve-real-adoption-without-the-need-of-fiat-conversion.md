The winter season in crypto market has been longer than usual compared to the previous 'January crashes'. Weak hands already sold their holding in loss and panic while some people said this is all due to whales manipulating market prices by spreading FUD. Although I'm buying the idea of the latter, a couple of real news did impact the market cap like the recent Tether drama. Looking back at 2017, the main theme of bad news has the biggest impact was obvious, **government regulation**. China ban ICO, South Korea regulate exchanges, India bans cryptocurrency, so on and so on. The market has been dancing to the government decision.

Cryptocurrency is meant to be decentralized. Why is the centralized government still able to manipulate the crypto market?

## Because we need to convert crypto to fiat anyhow

Although cryptocurrency has gained much attention lately, more and more shops and commercial units start to accept payment in crypto. But it is hard to deny that we are still far away in adopting the crypto in full scale in real life.

You can't buy house property or car using crypto, even if there may be someone will claim this is not true, but one cannot do this without a supportive government and they better be ready to answer the calls from IRA. You still need fiat put food on the table. Fiat is still the only way to buy dinner or snacks from the street vendors or restaurants.

Majority treat crypto as an investment asset rather than a currency. Of course, I would love to have the option to pay in Bitcoin. But considering it's fluctuating characteristic and I'm on the bright side that Bitcoin could gain more in value, I rather not to spend it. 

Stability is the key for a currency, and the crypto's fluctuation decides us couldn't live without fiat at least for the near future.

## It's good for them to cut away the bridge of fiat and crypto

To me, the real adoption is not everyone starting to use crypto as payment or exchange method, but in the end still, need to convert into fiat in order to communicate with the world. In this way, fiat is the base layer and crypto is atop of it. We will get back to the fundamental base somehow.

It should be in reversed instead, cryptocurrency should be the base for fiat, everyone communicates to each other in crypto.

If a government want to demote crypto all it has to do is shut down the exchanges, this has been effective in chasing people away from taking part in crypto. And it will remain as effective as there is still a demand to convert crypto into fiat. I foresee such need will decrease over time and more people will start to talk purely in crypto.

**They try to use cash realization as an obstacle in the way of crypto adoption, this will only force us not to use fiat anymore.**

币圈的冬季似乎比往常维持更久，相较前几年的“一月冬季”，尤其是昨天总市值更一度跌破 400B 大关。回顾 2017，每一次熊市的主调都离不开“政府”，从中国政府禁止 ICO，南韩实施管制交易所，到印度公开禁止加密货币。伴着政府们每一次的决定，市场都会随之起舞。为什么会这样呢？

**因为不管如何，我们终归需要把手上的币变现。**

尽管加密货币在近来确实是越来越火红，也有越来越多商家开始接受虚拟货币的支付方式。但无可否认的是，我们离全面使用货币还有很长的路要走。你不能用币来买房子或车子，也很难买食物来填饱肚子，因为绝大多数小贩餐厅还是只认法币的。当然加密货币本身的特性也使之不能成为货币，价格的不稳定性就是最重要的原因之一。对我来说币与其说拿来用，它们更像是投资产品。当某件持有物具有升值空间时，人们倾向不把它们当货币使用。这也是为什么在短期的未来，我不觉得加密货币可以真正的在支付上流行开来，也解释了为什么我们还是离不开法币。

**国家的干预和阻断是好的**

如果一个政府当局想要阻止人民参与加密货币，最有效的方法就是对交易所下手。因为人们就没有了购买货币或是变现的管道。然而这个方法只要一天还有变现的需求，一天都会有效。真正的普及化是人人都用加密货币过生活，而完全不再需要换成法币。钱币的建设趋向会是建立在区块链上，包括法币。希望这一天尽快到来。

**他们想利用掐死变现通道这方法来干预货币，只会让更多人选择寻找不再变现的方法。**
