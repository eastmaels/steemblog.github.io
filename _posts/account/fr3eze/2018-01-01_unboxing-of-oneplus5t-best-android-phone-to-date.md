Since I own the OnePlus 3 one year ago and still using it now everyday, I was deeply amazed by the quality and value that comes with this phone. 

So the first thing I recommended to my girlfriend when she want to upgrade her was the latest model from the same brand, OnePlus 5T.

Simplistic box in white color.

Right after the top cover was removed. Elegant way to present the phone at the first sight. Four little bumps in the corner to help stabilize the device.

We bought the China version so the back was a label  full of Chinese which can be removed with just a pull.

Unlike the previous models, this time the company decided to give away a free transparent case which I thought was rubbish but to my surprise it turned out to be a really good case.

Together there is a simple guide and sim tool as well. Still doesn’t come with earphone though.

*Dash charge* is one of the killer features of OnePlus. One hour charging session will almost get your phone fully charged. The only drawback is both the specific adapter and cable must be used in pair to activate the ultra fast *Dash charge*.

In my view this phone is awesome because:

- **Unbeatable value.** Pricing at 2999 RMB for flagship specifications that you can find on the Samsung.

- **Most friendly OS environment** OnePlus maybe is the only company that encourages user to root their device without voiding warranty.

- If you are looking for tge **sleekiest android expirience**, look no further for 5T is running HydrogeOS/OxygenOS that is very close to stock android.

Oneplus 5T 是目前我觉得性价比最高的手机，没有之一。2999 人民币的价格能让你拥有三星等大牌子旗舰手机的硬件，性能更是安卓手机里最顺畅的，因为使用了接近原生系统的 HydrogeOS 或是 OxygenOS 系统。

另外一个最大的特点就是一加这厂家非常鼓励社区针对自家系统的开发。不仅系统多数的代码都是开源的，连 root 了都不会取消原厂维修担保，实在是开发者的一大福音。
