<h2 id="steamsummersalesishere">Steam summer sales is here</h2>

<p>Ever since I've gotten the mighty <a href="/@fr3eze/myfirstdedicatedgraphiccard--gtx1080-jfo0zg7nb9">EVGA GTX 1080</a> few weeks ago, the main jobs that I threw to the card was all about mining, well-expected behavior from a crypto lover I know right? Nonetheless, mining is not the main reason to own this card, at least not bigger than the entertainment/gaming reason. </p>

<p>Logging in my Steam account after almost a year diving deep in its cousin platform <em>Steem</em>, the game library just lack of a game which can really challenge the monstrous GTX 1080, I need more games, graphic-demanding games! Very good timing for the Steam Summer Sales to be here!</p>

<p>One of the signature of the Steam sales is the discount intensity so high you can't really resist. Basically every titles in the store can start off 60% discount and you are in luck if the wishlist item goes 90%. Some other games you glancing through can sometimes grab your attention because they are so cheap. In the Steam Sales 2016, I've spent RM200-ish for a bunch of games and bundles which I didn't even play for more than 1 hour in 2 years time.</p>

<p>And that's the reason people says that buying games is a game to play, and there are some Steam sales survival guides to help preventing folks from repeating the mistake I've made. </p>

<h2 id="stickwithmywishlist">Stick with my wishlist</h2>

<p>Fortunately, items on my wishlist are all at average 65% discount and I gladly add most of them to the cart. Picked up a few interesting games along the way as well. Below are my picks:</p>

<p>Pro tips: Users in Malaysia has a huge shopping advantage on Steam as the <strong>games priced in MYR are way cheaper</strong> than most other currencies, for example SGD. </p>

<p>Not checking out yet but I sure will do before the end of sales (5th July). Do you fill up your cart yet, gamers?</p>

<p>玩家的的年度盛事终于降临啦，Steam Summer Sales 在这里正式宣布，银行账户已经准备好了，玩家们别客气尽量送钱来吧！</p>

<p>几个礼拜前入手的 GTX 1080 正好赶上这个游戏剁手庆典，皆因手上的游戏已经完全不够凸显 1080 的强劲威力。这次入手了几个心仪已久的大制作， Witcher 3 GTA 5 等有玩游戏的你想必要有耳闻，还在想要不要顺便一起把 Dark Soul 3 砍了下来。</p>

<p>你又入手了什么游戏呢？</p>
