By the definition of hot DAPP, I mean those which you can easily see everyone is mentioning be it at the trending page or from your own news feed. I have a list of hot DAPP on Steem that I haven't tried yet and here it is:

<ul>
<li><strong>Steemmonster</strong>: I love card games. In fact, I'm actively playing on my mobile phone every day. Not playing this one probably was due to I felt I was "left-out" and lost the first mover advantage that I didn't start the journey the moment I spotted this game.</li>
<li><strong>Drugwars</strong>: I'm lazy and learning new game rules is definitely outside of comfort zone. No regret so far as I noticed this game is constantly changing the rules, which I don't think is a good idea to run a game like this.</li>
<li><strong>Magicdice</strong>: And any other gambling platforms. I'm losing appetite for gambling starting the day I realise that the house is unbeatable in the long run.</li>
</ul>

What is your list? <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/what-hot-dapp-on-steem-that-you-havent-try-yet/ </em><hr/></center>
