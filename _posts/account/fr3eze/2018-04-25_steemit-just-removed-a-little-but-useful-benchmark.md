I noticed *steemit.com* has implemented a minor change recently, that they removed the view count at the end of the post. I got one lesser reason to visit steemit rather than the more comprehensive busy.org.

I know, the view count is not an accurate benchmark to judge how popular your post is, as it only taking traffic to the very website into the statistic. While other front-end sites like busy.org are not counting the page view, I will still pay a visit on steemit to see how many have read my post because that means something to me other than the payouts. 

No idea why they removed this little benchmark but this is exactly opposing my hope for the team to put more emphasis in consolidating the view count as [I believe this is the true benchmark to value a content](/@fr3eze/this-parameter-might-help-to-tell-who-is-really-a-popular-steem-author).

I'm displeased by this changes.

Steemit.com 拿掉了在帖子尾端的 View count，我相信[点阅数是衡量帖子价值的标准](/@fr3eze/this-parameter-might-help-to-tell-who-is-really-a-popular-steem-author)。真无趣，又少了一个使用这个老大哥前端网站的理由，还不如使用更全面的 Busy.org。
