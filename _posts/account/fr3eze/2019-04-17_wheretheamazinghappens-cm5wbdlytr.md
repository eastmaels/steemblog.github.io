This picture wasn't made by me but it illustrated perfectly what Spurs has performed in the NBA Playoff Game 2 today. Leading twice with 19 points and got comeback by the Denver during last 5 minutes. I thought this is another cool win but proven Denver was the second seed in the Western Conference for a reason. Nothing is impossible before the game ending whistle is blown. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/where-the-amazing-happens/ </em><hr/></center>
