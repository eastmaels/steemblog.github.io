In a random evening, a guy named <em>John Is The Best</em>(Chinese name 约翰是最好的) contacted me out of a sudden, let's call this guy John.

On daily basis, I'm actually receiving advertisement about new exciting coins and shits like that, so I have developed a habit to auto-ignore all the spams and I guess I should step up the privacy setting after this post.

Let's get back to our little John. John appeared to have some trouble. Without knowing who I'm in the first place, John was asking for my help as he could not withdraw his 0.9 BTC from an exchange due to the region limitation. Oh ya, he is from China(hence the Chinese name) although I doubt so.

So our conversation started this way:

Hmmm, mooncrypt.info, I immediately googled about it and the 0.9 BTC trick and this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/9t23m6/scam_httpsmooncryptinfo/">Reddit thread</a> was what I found. Okay, I could expect what trick John would have performed to me soon.

Logged in the exchange via John's credentials, there was indeed a 0.9BTC balance in the account thus I proceeded to withdraw it. I was supposed to do John such favour and I can keep 0.1 BTC for myself as a reward, how generous are you, John!

I was hit by this popup message, nonetheless, within my expectation.

The rest of the conversation was simple and I summarized them as followed:

<ul>
<li>I was kind enough to provide my BTC address for John to send me the 0.01 BTC in order to unfreeze his account.</li>
<li>John said he was broke.</li>
<li>I said me too. <strong>Converted all my shits to STEEM that morning.</strong></li>
</ul>

I could have sold away all my Steem if I'm in profit with the market price. Unfortunately, I'm not, just like the majority of Steemians here. Sorry John, I could have helped you if it were not for Steem. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/i-could-have-help-john-out-if-it-werent-for-steem/ </em><hr/></center>
