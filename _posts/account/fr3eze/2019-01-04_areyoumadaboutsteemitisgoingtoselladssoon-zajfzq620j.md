Finally <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@steemitblog/testing-ads-on-steemit-com">Steemit took the second thought to accept advertisement</a> after the infamous 70% layoff. Personally, I don't feel anything towards this change of attitude but I clearly understand hardcore no-ads users who raged and sneered so much down in the comment section.

Let's don't take the huge SP and significant position of <em>Steemit</em> is currently holding in the Steem blockchain, in the perfect world, <em>Steemit</em> is nothing but just another DAPP that runs on top of Steem and it should be treated as same as the other DAPPs, from the view of blockchain. With that said, <em>Steemit</em> could do whatever they want to do with their own application even if they decided to make everyone's thumbnail a naked girl. If they screw up big time, it is always the matter of time something better will arises and replace them.

<strong>Users always got the right to choose the frontend platform and frontend platform can do whatever they want at their own consequences.</strong>

Some even said <em>Steemit</em> betrays the users, cashing users content by advertising, just like the notorious FB and Google. Well, content creators on Steem need to realise the fact that they are not submitting their daily blogs to <em>Steemit</em>, but Steem, where all the data is readily available for anyone to retrieve and making use of it. <strong>An undergraduate with basic web knowledge can create his own fronted and cashing all the data he could collect on the blockchain in whatever ways.</strong>

No one is able to stop that from happening, and this is exactly why it is called a <strong>decentralised technology</strong>. Let's keep an eye on how things are going to play out, this is getting more interesting. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/are-you-mad-about-steemit-is-going-to-sell-ads-soon/ </em><hr/></center>
