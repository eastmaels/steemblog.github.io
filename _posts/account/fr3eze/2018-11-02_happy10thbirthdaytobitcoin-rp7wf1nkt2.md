A few days ago, it was the 10th birthday to the king of cryptocurrency and people took its birthday referring to the day Mr Satoshi published the Bitcoin Whitepaper to the Cryptography Mailing List, which was on <code>31 Oct 2008</code>.

Here is the brief introduction to the Bitcoin e-cash project by Satoshi himself.

<em>A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</em>, sounds very much old-fashioned and not attractive at all if I were to read this letter back in the day. Most of the readers of this letter would never be expected this "lame" project could impact and change the world at such a degree. And the ripple effect of Bitcoin success was just started followed by the recent market booming, although the crypto market is at a relatively bear market, it really depends on what stage of Bitcoin we are comparing to. Anyhow, a pile of random hash would worth a few thousand dollars per piece, I wonder if Mr Satoshi was expecting this coming or not.

Back in the day when this "e-cash" paper was announced,  I was just graduated from high school and looking hard for the path to the university. A computer was nothing but a gaming station for me. Never knew I was going to end up with Computer Science in the U and never expected I could go this deep with cryptocurrency which is having a big deal with computational technologies.

Anyway, any project that could last for 10 years is celebratableï¼Œ not to mention there is a huge potential for it to last for another 100 years. Happy belated birthday, Bitcoin!<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/happy-10th-birthday-to-bitcoin/</em><hr/></center>
