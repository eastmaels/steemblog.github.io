I started trading cryptocurrency 4 months and was lucky enough to be profitable so far, and it felt just awesome. Starting from 12 years old, I have done so many different kind of part-time jobs that I could come out with a [long list](https://steemit.com/cn/@fr3eze/part-time-jobs-i-ever-had). For someone like me who spend all of the time making money either through labour work or selling services and products, it was unbelievable to actually make money by trading in the market.

This makes me thinks a lot. This could be the best way of making a living. I don't have to commute to the office every morning in a crowded train. Answer and report to nobody. Do not need a storage to store products. Have nothing to ship and don't have to deal with annoying customers. All I need is a computer and internet access. Aren't this the best job ever? Of course, all the above will be true only if I can be trading profitably, consistently. That is hard but not impossible at all.

All the jobs create values for the world, and the outcome of one's job create value for the society. A toilet cleaner provide a comfortable environment for those in need to answer the natural call,  a CEO makes strategic decision to increase the revenue of the company. Everyone is doing their part contributing to the advancement of mankind and they are while making a living out of it. But not the trader.

How the trader makes money? No matter how fancy the strategies or formulas sounds, they buy low and sell high. For instance, I buy 1 Bitcoin at $5000, the next second it rise to $5010 and I sell it. Boom, I made $10 out of the thin air! Except for me and the exchange, did I make anyone happier or better by doing this? I did not. 

Some economists might say trading is beneficial to the economy by throwing abstruse terminologies at me. But sorry, I can't see how making money by some random clicks in front of a computer can benefits anything, except my pocket. As such, I regard trading has zero productivity compared to all the other stuff I've been through to earn money. 

It was kind of a complicated feeling. I'm glad that making money can be this easy at the same time feeling lost as I'm not adding value to the world. But surely I do feel great overall if I can be a successful trader.

There are many ways to make someone feel great about themselves too. The most obvious one will be a donation. So stop worrying not being constructive, you can do achieve anything when you have a deep pocket!

四个月前接触了加密货币，就开始了市场交易的道路，而且很幸运的这段日子都是赚钱的。打从十二岁开始，我就做过[各式各样的工作](https://steemit.com/cn/@fr3eze/part-time-jobs-i-ever-had)。赚钱对我来说，从来就是和出卖劳力划上等号的。但是我仍然记得第一次再市场中交易赚钱的感觉，是那么的激动人心和不可置信。

这也让我想了很多，市场交易实在是最棒的工作之一。不需要天天挤地铁去上班，没有上头需要汇报。不用租个厂库来囤货，也不用买卖货物，更不用面对烦人的客户。给我一台电脑和wifi，就可以起飞。这还不是最好的赚钱途径？当然，前提是必须稳定的可以从险恶的市场中脱颖而出。很难，但并非不可能。

世上所有的工作都会创造价值，工作的成果会为社会带来影响。厕所清洁工付出汗水创造了舒适干净的如厕环境，上市公司的CEO燃烧脑细胞为公司谋取更高的营收。每个人都在赚钱的过程中为某些东西添加了价值，为社会进步作出了贡献。但是交易员（trader）是例外。

交易员如何赚钱的？不管他们使用的策略还是方程式有多么的酷炫深奥，始终都离不开一个原则，买低卖高。以比特币为例，我在$5000时买进，下一秒$5010时卖出，一眨眼间就赚了十块钱。没有货物买卖，没有价格谈判，我就已经比一秒前的我富有了10块钱！除了我的口袋和交易平台，还有谁在这过程中受益？答案是没有。

可能这里某些经济学家就会跳出来说其实交易行为会为社会经济带来正面影响，然后抛出一堆艰深难懂的术语理论。原谅我的才疏学浅，还是看不出在电脑前用滑鼠按两下这样的赚钱行为有直接让谁得到好处了。所以市场交易这种行为在跟其他我所做过的工作中，是最没有社会生产率的。

这是一种很复杂的感觉。赚钱原来可以这么简单这回事让我欣喜不已，但意识到这不是什么富有价值的行为却也让我有点迷失。当然如果幸运可以成为一个赚钱的交易者，开心绝对是居多的。

其实要自我感觉良好还是有很多方法的，最直接的就是捐款做善事。所以还是别忧心这钱赚得有没有价值了，赶紧加深口袋的厚度才是正道啊！
