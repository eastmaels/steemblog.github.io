The Steemdice is a simple gambling game that utilizing STEEM's blazing fast transaction time that I see the potential for it to become a really great gambling chip.

Steemdice is simple as 123:
- Login with the Steem account with active key permission
- Place the `Bet Amount` either in STEEM or SBD.
- Set the `Win Chance` from 1 to 99.
- Roll the Dice!

For example, you set `Win Chance` by 70 and roll the dice. Within a few second the Steemdice algorithm will get you a random number from 1 to 99 as well. **If the generated number smaller than 70, you win, otherwise you lose.** Told you it is dead simple right?

### Things to take note

- Steemdice is taking 2% from winning bet as house edge.
- Gambling can be addictive, play with the amount you can afford to lose. Text @pharesim for blacklisting your account for better self-control.
- The game code is open-source which you can view [here](https://github.com/pharesim/steemdice) if you are feeling suspicious(I love open-souce stuff!).

We use STEEM and SBD every day but sometimes it is easy to forget how powerful this lovely cryptocurrency can be. Zero fees, 3 seconds transaction time with a huge community, Steemdice is the simplest yet efficient application I've ever used to take full advantage of those wonderful characteristics.

As long as one does not overdo it, a couple of nice dice games using STEEM/SBD is always welcome!
