Sometimes it took a different perspective in seeking new inspiration during the art creating process. Especially within a themed story where the artist cannot just draw anything out of his mind. 

I found that using the operating way of a **zoom lens** is very fun in finding new idea what to draw next for the story illustration. You can zoom out so far away that forming a magnificent wide angle scene, or zoom so closely to the detail part of a bot's body. Adjusting the zooming range and you will have endless inspiration to all the next drawing.

This drawing was inspired by the *Jemima-479* which was part of the previous story by @cryptogee
