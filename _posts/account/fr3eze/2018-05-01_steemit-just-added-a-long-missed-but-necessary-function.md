Was frustrated about the Steemit just being slow in the loading few minutes ago before everything goes back to normal suddenly. After my first ever Steem meet-up in SG, I was going to make a payment for the drink fee last night to @rockysmarties using SBD (Yay the first time making full use of the mighty Steem/SBD!).

Inputting the recipient and amount to transfer as usual and proceed, then I was surprisingly greeted by the following dialogue:

The long waited **Confirmation** dialogue I've been waited for so long! Paranoid user like me always wondering why Steemit could skip such an important mechanism before carrying out a transfer. The double-checking frequency is always directly proportional to the amount I was going to send before this, characters by characters of the recipient name, digit by digit of the amount column. 

Glad I don't have to do it anymore!

Steemit 就在刚刚加入了一个小而贴心的功能，那就是传送 Steem 或是 SBD 的时候加入了确认的对话框。一直以来纳闷了很久，这么简单必要的汇款流程怎么这么大的一个网站都可以忽略呢。害我以前汇款时都一个字一个字的检查接收方的名字没有拼错，再一个数字一个数字的检查数目没有打错。汇款数额越大，我的检查次数就越多，搞得每次汇款都好像在拆炸弹。现在好了，终于告别这白痴的烦恼！
