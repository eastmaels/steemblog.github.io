Defend champion GSW has fallen behind 2-3 after the loss in Game 5. They will have to answer strong or this will be their last game in the season and their second attempt to defend champion will be failed again.

Personally, I will be on GSW side as I tend to be support the weaker team. Although they have the strongest crew on paper but still struggling to reflect that on game score facing the hungry Rockets. Steph Curry really has to stand out to contribute as a superstar player for the franchise. He has been *sleeping* for the last few games taking into account how explosive and damaging his scoring ability can be.

After all, the Rockets will put all their best together in order to close the last deal of stepping on the floor of NBA Finals after decades. The last appearance in the Finals for the Rockets was the time of the Dream Hakeem Olajuwon if I'm not wrong.

However, the adsent of CP3 due to injury will be the biggest suspense of this matchup. Such a shame both team cannot have a perfect fight at each highest level in such critical game. Can James Harden suck it all up and carry the team and pull this through, he would definitely be deified to accomplish this.

Let's see!

果然一如预期的这个系列不在六场还是七场里是解决不了的，精彩程度不下于总决赛！纸面实力最为强大的*宇宙勇*居然大比分落后，要是 Curry 再不醒来做出他身为超级巨星的贡献，这次勇士又要卫冕失败了。另一方面，在封馆之战的火箭这一仗必定会拿出浑身结束避免把比赛拖入抢七。但坏消息时 CP3 却在这个关键时刻受伤不能上场，就看看 Harden 和其他人员能否撑过这次了。

无论如何，一定是场好 game！
