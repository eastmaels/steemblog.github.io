<h2>A ranking of 31 crypto projects</h2>

China's Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) has just released its third crypto project ranking last week. To be honest, I have no idea how authoritative this is but China has been as big part in recognizing the blockchain technology so I guess they will have more right to speak on this matter.

<h2>EOS the top, Steem the 7th, and BitShares the 10th</h2>

Wow, this list is much in favor to the legendary @dan aka the ByteMaster. All of his 3 projects made it to the top 10, the potential of Graphene framework and DPoS mechanism are highly recognized here. I'm glad to be an active part of the proud Steem project on daily basis, kudos to its creator and the awesome concept.

<h2>Some new faces on the list which I don't understand</h2>

Gladly I heard most of the projects on the list and roughly aware of their mission, not nice to be left out  behind being someone I claimed to be betting my future with crypto. Ignorance would cost you something now or later.

<strong>Nano</strong> was surprisingly low ranked at the bottom part of the list together with LTC. Both have clear roadmap of becoming a digital currency to the network while having totally different technologies. I have high hopes for the Nano and plan to get some in the near future. Maybe now can be a good entry point as it is at the lowest price after the all time high $32.

<h2>Usability is the king</h2>

It's my firm believe to judge a project's value by looking at its application, what problems does it solve and how can it make people life better. The best example is our very Steem which brings a tons of value to the content creators including me. Devs should keep on coming up with new projects with great usability as such.

However, straying from all the serious crypto value talk, I feel good to sometimes looking at the wild side of this space. Yes, the hot POWH3D and FOMO3D which topped the Dapp rank in Ethereum. I have no interest in the later but has invested some in the POWH3D.

Interesting concept, complete transparency, and simple mechanism. I should talk(shill) more about it on the next post, Til then, if you are feeling adventurous, use my masternode link to get some P3D:

EOS, Steem, BTS 分别进入了赛迪全球工友链的前十，DPoS 的实用性实在是被高度的肯定得不行，也证明了 Dan 真乃神人也！名单上尽管有些生面孔，但还好多数都还是叫的出名堂来，身为一个<em>誓要生活在Crypto世界的我</em>来说也不至于太惭愧。名单上的排名多数还是基于技术和实用性来安排的，两者确实很重要，也是我判断某个项目的基础之一。但是义正词严的讨论价值多了，很多时候也会想去看看野外危险的世界，没错，说的就是近来最夯的 POWD3D 和 FOMO3D，后者没什么兴趣，毕竟可能性太小。倒是 <a href="https://powh.io/?masternode=0x6e02e12a3458c82d5ae51d1492e8bca14e1532a7">POWD3D</a> 这是有种让我眼前一亮的感觉。下次专门来讨论吧！
