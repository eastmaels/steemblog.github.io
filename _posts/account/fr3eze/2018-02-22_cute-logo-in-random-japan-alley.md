We were in this random alley somewhere in Nara looking for a restaurant that Google Map suggested.

Alley was totally deserted, sun is warmly bright, and sky is thoroughly blue. Then I met this unknown house with a cute logo. Not sure what this logo implies but it looks very much like a Shapeshift and PRISM logo.

While this one is much more clean and simplified, it is not likely this house has something to do with crypto. Damn, a random symbol in a random alley in Japan could reminds me something about crypto, I must be deeply poisoned.

在日本奈良的某个巷子前往觅食的路途上，阳光明媚，小巷里空无一人，天空蓝得好像假的一样。经过一间屋宇，边上有个很可爱的小标志，直接联想到 Shapeshift 和 PRISM 的图标，活脱像个小狐狸的头。只是我更喜欢这个，线条更简洁有力。

在异国陌生小巷里的随机标志都可以让我想起加密货币，真的是中毒太深了。
