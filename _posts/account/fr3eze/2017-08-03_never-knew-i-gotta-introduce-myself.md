## Yo there,  glad to greet y'all in this awesome platform!
I'm a 27 years old from Malaysia. Computer lover with IT background, as well as a new believer in the amazing blockchain technology. 
I deeply believe blockchain gonna be the future and improve our live in every aspect. I started to spend a couple of hours every day on studying this technology, exploring  new projects, and trying my best to take part in interesting projects. Steemit turns out to be the most easy project for anyone to dive in. Woohoo!

> 大家好！我是个电脑爱好者，27岁，来自马来西亚，是区块链技术的新拥护者。 我深信区块链技术将会让我们未来变得更美好，所以每天都花几个小时来学习这项技术，探索新的虚拟币计划，和不断尝试参与其中。Steemit 是目前为止最容易让人们全身投入的计划，没有之一！

## I love workout.
I called this 'hobby of life'. However as a total big fan of bodyweight workout, I do not belong to the mainstream 'gym rat' race, so I can happily workout anywhere anytime with the least environmental restrictions. No time is wasted going to the gym and no money is wasted on gym membership. Lesser cost yet higher intensity. Yay, train like a gymnast!
> 我爱锻炼，这是个终身爱好。 但我对健身院并不太感冒，徒手訓練才是王道。不需花时间赶去健身院，不需花钱在会员证。随时随地就能训练，免费的同时还能保持高强度！

## I love art.
I love creating them, admiring them. As much as I used to indulge in this addictive activities, I've been away for quite a while. Missing those days having so much fun with the the brushes, may be I should pick them up again in the near future, and of course I shall share it with you Steemians!
> 我爱艺术，包括创造和赏析它们。 尽管我曾经那么的热爱这项活动，忙起来现在也许久没有动笔了。但那些挥笔如洒得日子也真够令人怀念的，希望不久的将来能够再度回归艺术的怀抱。当然了，一定要来这里分享的啦！

## I love travelling.
Apparently, who doesn't love travelling? I enjoy recording every trip as I think video talks better than picture. But well, currently I don't spend too much time on this yet. May be once or twice in a year for a short getaway for not more than a week. Time and money is the biggest constraints for me to plan for more trips, as I prefer to put the resources more onto higher prioritized stuffs. I swear I will travel all year long when I'm a cryptomillionaire, haha!
> 我爱旅行，其实有谁不爱呢。 比起拍照，旅途中我更喜欢用视频记录一切，视频让日后的回味更有味道，难道不是吗？其实现今阶段我并没有花太多时间在旅行上，目前还有更多值得我把资源投入的事还没达成。但要是日后我有机会成为虚拟币百万富翁，全年旅行是绝对跑不掉的，呵呵！

## And, creating more quality contents
Yes I think this is the only effective way to grow our beloved community. I'v promised myself to create at least one content every one or two days, HARD for a lazy person like me, but I should keep on trying! Peace~
> 最后，我相信创造有价值的内容是让Steemit日渐壮大的唯一途径。我计划每两天起码写一篇文章，但以我对自己的了解程度而言，有点难度啊。无论如何，让后我们拭目以待吧！加油！
