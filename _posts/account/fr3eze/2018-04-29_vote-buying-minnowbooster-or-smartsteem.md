Minnowbooster has recently released the Community Whitelist program to reduce the abuse of spam content promoting. Only the whitelisted members are eligible to buy high volume of vote from @minnowbooster would be the great solution of letting everyone accessing to the high SP of voting bots.

## Whitelist was is the exclusive feature of Smartsteem

@smartsteem is one of the top vote-selling services now with more than 4000 delegators hosted by @therealwolf. I was very fascinated the team's vision to maintain the cleanliness of the Steem platform by introducing the Smart star whitelisting system. Moderators from the Smartsteem team review applications from the public, approving or rejecting base on the quality of the author. Upon approval, whitelisted authors will be assigned from 1 star to maximum 3 star rating. The higher the rating the higher vote one can buy from the service.

Minnowbooster however, follows the initiative of Smartsteem introducing the whitelist system. The difference is the process is more decentralised. There is no application but invitation. Whitelisted members get to vote on invited users, upon getting 3 votes one admin will be able to approve the whitelist user. There are more benefits to be a whitelisted member of than bigger votes capacity, read the original [post](/minnowbooster/@minnowbooster/minnowbooster-epic-update-community-whitelist-now-online) for more insight.

## Which is the better service to buy votes?

Assuming you are whitelisted in both service, **Minnowbooster is going to be the superior choice now.**

Smartsteem was my favourite for their high and steady availability of votes capacity. However, due to last price spiking of Steem from $1.5, the demand for vote buying from Smartsteem surged as well. To maintain vote supply, the team has decided to reduce the vote-buying ROI to the `range of 180% and 210%`.

[Minnowbooster](http://www.minnowbooster.net/) on the other hand, was always in the shortage of vote supply and that was the reason I decided to look for alternative and found Smartsteem. Somehow their vote supply is becoming steady lately and after a several vote-buying from the Minnowbooster, I found out the ROI could be around `220% and 240%.`

For the same 1 SDB, Smartsteem would give you a vote at maximum $2.2 vs $2.4 from the Minnowbooster. I'd definitely go for Minnnowbooster unless things changed.

Minnowbooster 比 Smartsteem 更适合买赞，前者的回报高达 `220% ~ 240%` 而后者则是`180% ~ 210%` 。
