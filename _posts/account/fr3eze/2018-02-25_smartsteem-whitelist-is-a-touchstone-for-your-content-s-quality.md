I've decided to [start using Smartsteem](/@fr3eze/another-great-platform-to-promote-content-smartsteem) for content promoting via the @smartmarket bot. However, as a normal user which the platform regard as 'everyone', I can only get a vote up to $0.776 as the time being.

<center><sub>Screentshot from [smartsteem.com](smartsteem.com) for the real time vote-value</sub></center>

At the same time, whitelisted users are entitled to vote-value up to $84.581. I wanted to be one of them and I proceeded to submit my request through their site. Knowing that they have a 40 pages pending whitelist request and have only 4 moderators, I prepared to have a long wait.

To my surprise, I got whitelisted the second day, wow!

I was whitelisted as an one-SmartScore user first, only to find out I was promoted to two star user just now. Not bad! Nonetheless, it wasn't clear what the is difference between different star users and how to promote to higher grade. Keep posing quality post I supposed?

Anyway, glad that **I can buy votes with more value now and get to know that my content is recognized by the team.** One stone two birds. Awesome idea execution by @therealwolf and his team by actually make user feels good using little tweaks like these.

Sign up now and get whitelisted if you think your content is quality enough: https://smartsteem.com?r=fr3eze

[上篇](/@fr3eze/another-great-platform-to-promote-content-smartsteem)分享了 @smartsteem 的强大。但是对买赞来说，Smartsteem 把用家分为两类。

第一类就是大众，任何人都可以买赞，但是赞的价值被限制得很厉害。根据上图，大众用家只可以买到最多价值 $0.776 的赞。第二类就是今天的重点介绍啦，白名单用家。用家必须经过团队的审核才可以进入白名单，而成功进入后可买到最高 $84 的赞，差别可是非常之大。

~~基于自己创作的高度信心~~我毫不犹豫申请了白名单。没想到第二天就通过了，还获得了二星的评价，这寥寥数人的团队效率真是高得吓人。要知道等待名单可是又四十页之多。

这下好了，我不单可以买到更有价值的赞，也还因为创作内容品质被承认而沾沾自喜不已，一箭双雕也！

如果你想享受高质量服务和对自己的创作品质有信心，马上注册和申请白名单吧: https://smartsteem.com?r=fr3eze
