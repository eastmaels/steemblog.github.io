>This series is to record my SmartCash journey. This is very much a high-risk experimental act and I'm prepared to lose all the fund invested. Do your own research as this is not a financial advice.

## Smartbot on the Steem

The @smartbot is running on Steem blockchain and serving as the name suggested, a **Tip Bot**. Not sure how exactly is this bot running in the background as it is kind of closed source, I will try to make a few assumptions on how the @smartbot is going to work base on my observation and understanding(which can be quite accurate to the fact).

Everyone on Steem will automatically be assigned with a SmartCash address which can be verified by using the `@smartbot address` command in any comment area. The logic behind should be the same as sending crypto to email address because each email addresses are unique, as well as out Steem account name.

While I know SmartCash actually support the feature by [sending SMART by email](http://mailsmart.smartcash.cc/) and any fund not collected within 7 days will be auto-returned, there are not stated if the tip sent by @smartbot will practice the same rule as well. But why leave the SMART at the Steem account while you can claim it to own wallet and start collecting [SmartReward](https://smartcash.cc/what-are-smartrewards/) or even start a SmartNode?

Screenshots above showed how I transfer 60 SMART to my own wallet. The response of @smartbot is really quick and responsive. Within 10 seconds you shall see the fund appears in your wallet.

## Oh, did I forget to mention how I get those tips?

SmartCash made a really genius move by hosting an official account(@smartcashï¼‰ on Steem which is not seen in many other crypto projects when Medium and Reddit are still the mainstream promoting sites. Steemit.com is already a top-1000 website globally and I would say partner with this new strong force for building SmartCash community is a brilliant idea.

To make things even more awesome, Team SmartCash is running persistent weekly event by tipping great content about SmartCash.

Making a contribution to the SmartCash content and everyone is entitled to win the tip from 30 to as high as 450 SMART(around $45)! I've got a few tips for 30 SMART each since the beginning of this series, I would not say that is a big amount but definitely nice to have. Especially I wasn't started with competitive mindset at all. As stated before this series is meant to be a documentation of my journey in SmartCash while providing some insights to the community and outsiders.

However, I do hope one day I will make my way to the *best article of the week* and that would be great!

@smartcash has made some guideline updates in order to win the weekly prizes which you may check it out at:

This would greatly reduce the spam and junk content in the #smartcash list and those new requirements sound just fair to me. The admins will have fewer eyestrains in judging the submitted entries as well. Great move.
