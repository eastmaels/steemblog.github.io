Decided to try my luck in the FOMO3D quick where the hardcap of the game is only 5 min, a game designed truly to test how fear could play out.

The idea is, I'm not going to snipe he active pot to win over the large lump sum of ETH, but to buy some KEYs as early as possible when a new round starts. <strong>So that I can get use the cheapest cost to earn some dividend as long as the particular round is not ending.</strong>

Since the previous few rounds was ended around 50~70 ETH, I tried to join during 60s ICO period where all the keys are selling at the same price. Unfortunately I missed that and entered when the active pot was around 22 ETH. One key cost around 0.09 ETH and I bought 4 keys. The total cost is around 0.35 ETH and once the fund is sent, they are as good as gone.  Now all I hold is <strong>4 KEYs and hoping that round would last longer so that system could keep paying me dividend from those who buy the KEYs later than me.</strong>

Yes, I was fascinated by the game mechanism but hating the feeling of not able to control my earning at the same time.

<h2>The round ended at 30 something ETH in the pot</h2>

I did not particulary know the exact amount of total pot amount since the tool is not ready for this purpose yet. But the last time I saw the round was alive and the fund is at 30+ ETH 1 hour before I see the game has started a new round.

Damn, anyhow I just got back 0.05 ETH from the dividend and <strong>0.3 ETH</strong> in a morning.

Should have put this fund into the <a href="https://powh.io/?masternode=0x6e02e12a3458c82d5ae51d1492e8bca14e1532a7">P3D</a>.
