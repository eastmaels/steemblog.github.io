今天工作上发生了一件令人啼笑皆非的事情。系统维护小组的一位阿姨管理员，带着两个小鲜肉一起为线上系统做调整。期间，她叫其中一个小鲜肉把另一个伺服器的设定用 GUI 的方式抄过来在另一个伺服器上，我在旁听了就给个<em>聪明点</em>的建议，好让他不用像个终端用户般用滑鼠一个一个按，毕竟是个系统管理员，这样做也更专业点。

做到一半的时候这位阿姨发现他们没有照着她的方法做，当场就发脾气了，说了一大堆气话，什么不听我的我就回家，我叫你怎么做你就跟着做，我知道你们很聪明，我不够聪明。拜托，知道自己不够聪明就保持谦卑接纳更好的工作方式好吗，我看着她这样<em>无理取闹</em>，实在是无力吐槽。

明明就是个笨法子，却硬是要用那无用的资历来倚老卖老让年轻的也学自己那套，还说人家不尊重她，这样固步自封的工作态度要如何让人尊重?

Four years in my working place and I saw this ridiculous shit for the first time. There is another group of maintenance team consist of an senior old lady and two young lads, they are responsible for upkeeping a live system on client side. 

Today, the old lady instructed those lads to copy the same configuration over to other server using the GUI clicking method. I wasn't in the team but as a senior administrator from the same company I advise them to use the *smarter way* to do it, which is copy the configuration file over and modify some variables, which is much quicker and more *admin* way of doing things. Young lads agreed that was a good idea and proceed to try this way out. 

While they are trying the old lady came back to the room and found this out. Out of nothing at all she started to get upset, claiming that they weren't *respect her*. She started to throw out unreasonable word like "If you are not listening to me, I will just go home." "Do whatever I told you to do." While obviously our workaround works much better with high efficiency. We were stunned a little and carry on our way and the issue was solved in no time.

I 'm glad I wasn't mentored by an unprofessional sysadmin like her.
