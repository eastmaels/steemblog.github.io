Something I've been waiting for so long finally shows the sign that is coming to realization. The <em>government</em> of Steem <a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@dana-edwards/dan-and-ned-powering-down-millions-worth-of-steem-why">starting to power down</a> the biggest stake ever happened in the blockchain, and the owner of the uncompetitive government has already completed his personal power down, and moved all the fund to an exchange account.

While doing so, realizing the ledger is transparent which such a big movement will surely trigger the public's awareness, the government also stated a ridiculous and pathetic statement via a memo saying that such movement was due to some security concern. Secured from what? Likely not the theft, but the seemingly dangerous proposal of hardfork that is going to nullify the huge stake.

Powering down all the SP and moving all the fund to exchange, while telling the community that they are not going to run away with it, sounds exactly like those famous Wall St. investors telling the public to avoid cryptocurrency at all cost, but buying Bitcoin so hard while they still can behind the stage.

This is probably the biggest FUD I've ever seen in the Steem community and a handful of wise stakeholders seems starting to power down as well. Whether the government will eventually selling to crash the market or not, I don't see any bull sign for Steem for most of the time this year, and this is gonna be a long year for Steem. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/10-cent-steem-is-not-that-far-away/ </em><hr/></center>
