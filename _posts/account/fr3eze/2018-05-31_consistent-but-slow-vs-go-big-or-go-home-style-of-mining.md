If you are entitled to choose 2 type of secondary income source, the first will be slow and steady persistent income or the second *not-guaranteed* style of income, but tends to earn a lot more if the luck kicks in? 

To make the scenarios more specific, the first will be making $10 per day consistently for a yearly sum around $3600. The second one will be more drastic, constantly making $0 a day but the catch is there are less than 10% that you will hit a $10,000 jackpot over a year. Which income will you take?

Well, I've been mining for about a week and been thinking what strategy is the best for my condition. I have a steady job which supports most of my daily needs financially, I started to see the potential of mining in becoming the next steady source of income. However, this new stream of income can largely depend on different strategies.

Given the same hashing power and cost basis, there are two main ways of mining:

# The *Mine-and-Sell*

This is the mainstream way of mining as I observed. The approach is usually picking a famous coin preferably coins in the top 100 list to mine. After a certain amount of time, say monthly, sell away those coins for BTC or fiat for profit.

The mining profit can be used to pay electricity bill or maintaining the miner machine. Pocket the remaining cash or use it to expand the mining rigs. Less risk, low but predictable income thanks to the stability of the famous coin. 

# The *Mine-and-Hold*

This method is more in seeking explosive growth of mined coins. Pick under-the-radar coins which is ranging from the 500~2000 ranking and mine, if not the entirely new coins. If you talk about these coins with your crypto mate, chances are they never heard of it at all.

Mine and keep the coins. You would not want to sell it now as they are mostly underpriced and with low trading volume. There are no profit gained in the process and miner has to bear with the incurred expenses like electricity bill.

# Make a choice

I have a day job which provided me with a stable pay and I don't mine for a living at all, that's the biggest reason I have no appetite for the *Mine-and-Sell*. To be honest, I will always go for the more aggresive and gambling-like *Mine-and-Hold* way. Go big or go home!

The rough plan is, use my limited hashing power to mine the coins with low difficulty but with some prospect. Some researchs has to be done and come out with a list of coins to be mined. 

With my current 2k H/s, I will be able to mine any young projects to 10,000 coins within a week. Upon hitting the 10k mark, jump to mine the next coin in the list and so on. So say at the end of the days, I will hold 100 different bags of coins with 10k each. I shall do nothing until one of them to appear in the top 100 list in coinmarketcap.com.

Worst come to worst, that 100 bags of coins all failed and fell to zero. The most I can lose is the electricity fee incurred in the process and it won't be much since I'm mining the CryptoNight coins with power-saving CPU.

Sounds like a plan, isn't it? What do you think and which strategy would you choose if you were me?

慢而稳，还是博彩式

挖矿有毒，这一个礼拜的挖矿实验真的让人越踩越深。已经有打算好好利用手中的资源认真挖一挖，那么问题来了，到底怎么挖法才是最适合自己？经过几天的考虑，发现有两种挖矿风格：

**挖了就卖** - 相信这也是市面上矿工们的主流做法。选些稳定且有名的币来挖，这类币通常都是 Top 100 的名单上可以见到。好处是定期把币卖了可以抵消成本比如电费和维护费等等，剩余的还可以做为扩展用途。坏处就是由于币的价格趋于稳定，要赚大钱有难度。

**挖了收着** - 顾名思义，就是只挖不卖。只选新币或是冷门小众的项目下手，趁挖矿难度还很低的时候挖了一笔就走，然后继续挖新的项目。坏处就是挖矿期间绝大可能不会有收益，还需要矿工自掏腰包付电费等。但是好处就是，要是手上的一袋袋新币要是某天爆发了，那个收益也一定是爆发性的。

由于我有稳定的工作来支撑生活支出，所以作为第二收入，第一个方法并不是很适合我。相反，**挖了收着**的巨大收益潜力最是吸引我不过，尤其里面蕴藏的赌局意味，更是挑战眼光和毅力。当然了，我是不会说自己是个赌徒的。

最差的情况就是手上收着的币到最后统统崩盘了，我损失的也不过是每个月几百的电费，不就是当作用那几百买币失败就好啦。

你怎么说？
