Finally I met the first store that accepts Bitcoin as payment in Japan, which is the Bic Camera, as suggested by @joywanderer as well.

We had a really long day inside this shop that located in Namba. You will meet many branches of Bic Camera in Japan but you don't normally got to visit a 7-storey-high Bic Camera. Don't be confused by the shop name, it sells all kind of stuff other than just cameras. From home applicants to digital gaming accessories.

I did not ask the cashier about how Bitcoin payment will be proceed as well as there is a huge language barrier between us. However I can guess the Bitcoin rate will follow the Bitflyer exchange as it is quoted on the board.

We bought something but none was paid via Bitcoin. Despite of having an empty crypto wallet, I don't wish my transaction for some small home accessories will takes up to 30 minutes to complete. Nor do I wish my transaction will cost at least 10 USD for network fee. Not to mention that Bic Camera offers extra 5% discount for Visa payment.

To my humiliation as a crypto believer, I just can't find a reason to spend my almighty Bitcoin in a Bitcoin-acceptable store.

Maybe people have to start to consider accepting some superior coins, like Steem?

今天终于遇到了接受比特币的实体店，就是遍布日本各地的 Bic Camera 。遗憾的是，我毫无用比特币消费的欲望。由于语言不通，我也没细问店员比特币付款的详细过程。不过可以确定的是，我不想区区几间件商品的付款过程要花上半个小时的确认时间，更不想为这交易付上至少十美金的手续费。就更别提使用 Visa 付款还可享有 5% 的折扣。

在接受比特币的商店我居然一点都不想使用比特币，真的好讽刺。或许商家们是时候考虑更高效的货币，比如伟大的 Steem？
