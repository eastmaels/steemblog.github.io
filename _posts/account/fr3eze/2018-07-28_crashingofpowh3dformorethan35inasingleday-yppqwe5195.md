<h2>Sudden crash of P3D tokens</h2>

Logged in my <a href="https://powh.io/?masternode=0x6e02e12a3458c82d5ae51d1492e8bca14e1532a7">PoWH3D</a> this boring afternoon to see something making this afternoon not boring anymore.

At first the total Rewards jumped to <code>0.23ETH</code> from the last remembered <code>0.05ETH</code> and I thought something was wrong. Refreshed the site and the figure remain the same, OKAY this is not a dream, let's proceed to the <a href="https://powh.trade/">trading chart</a> to see what is happening.

Holy cow, P3D was dumping like crazy from all time high 85k ETH in the contract to 60k ETH now, more than 35% of dipping! Check through the Discord channel and nothing special is happened, it appeared to be a pure emotional market movement just like any other crypto trading market.

<h2>The power of weak hands</h2>

This is the 5th day since I bought in some <a href="https://powh.io/?masternode=0x6e02e12a3458c82d5ae51d1492e8bca14e1532a7">P3D</a> and the single day to earn most due to the sudden crash. And this is the first time I truly experienced the power of POWH, weak hands feeding your wallet with free ETH is definitely awesome!

Do not forget all the trading activity including selling P3D for ETH will incur 10% of fee which then distributed to all strong hands who hold. This crash is exactly what I'm wishing for.

<a href="https://powh.io/?masternode=0x6e02e12a3458c82d5ae51d1492e8bca14e1532a7">PoWH3D</a> as a social experiment has already succeed tremendously at this point because it allows all the folks within this game to experience all the emotions in a very violent way.

We shall see how things go, it is getting more interesting!
