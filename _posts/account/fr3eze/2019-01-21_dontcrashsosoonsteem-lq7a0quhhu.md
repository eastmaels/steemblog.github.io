Steem being one of my largest crypto stakes has given me such a complicated feeling in the past few days. The price is neglecting all the FUD in the community and heading upward, especially while the whole market is plumbing. This definitely looks fishy and some big <em>insiders</em> are surely doing something behind the scene.

I'm worried about the Steem platform because this is the biggest FUD moment I've ever seen in 2 years on the very platform, and this is enough scares all the potential and existing stakeholders away.
I'm glad for the Steem platform because we finally wake up and face our biggest fear and conflict in the platform, the STINC.

While I personally disapprove the very company that made this platform, like almost everyone else, I have little to no say to the incoming to-be-made decision. The only thing I can do is to <a href="https://steemit.com/invest/@fr3eze/speculationontherecentsteemspikesellingallmyliquidsteemaway-7hqbzagqa0">speculate and sell my Steem away</a> hoping to buy back low in the future. Whoever is gaming the Steem market price now, don't stop before I at least powered down my first 1/13 SP. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/dont-crash-so-soon-steem/ </em><hr/></center>
