<h2>Be the true master of your PC</h2>

Days ago I used the <a href="https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@fr3eze/10appsmanager-get-rid-of-windows-10-preinstalled-bloatware#">10AppsManager</a>  to get rid of all the bloatware that come with installation of Windows 10. Take a look at the first picture, <em>Sway</em>? What the hell is that? <em>3D Builder</em>? Why the hell do I need that?

I proceeded to uninstall almost all of them without a second thought. If you feeling some of those <em>new</em> apps might be useful and cannot decide whether to get rid of them, try my advice here: <strong>Delete whatever you do not recognize by the name. Keeping them and chances are you will keep forgetting them and leave it consuming your PC resources as always.</strong>

The <em>Photos</em> is the only one I probably found useful and kept it installed after this.

<h2>Freed up CPU usage by 10%!</h2>

Left picture was then and the right one was now. I thought the Memory will the most benefited resource after a the cleaning up but it seems like remaining the same after a reboot. I supposed those bloatware wasn't start up automatically when Windows boots up.

Surprisingly, I did notice the CPU usage was great reduced from 10~13% to 1~4%. Seems like these bloatware eats up quite an amount of the processing power right up when everything is started.

图一的软件你认得几个呢？事实是，它们都是 Windows 10 的免费赠品。尽管一次都没有打开过，甚至不知道它们的存在，默默陪伴着你直到如今。<em>Photos</em>恐怕是我唯一有使用过的 apps 了吧，其他的都已经通过 <a href="https://steemit.com/steemhunt/@fr3eze/10appsmanager-get-rid-of-windows-10-preinstalled-bloatware#">10AppsManager</a> 一次过清除干净。心里痛快之余，还意外地发现电脑重启之后 CPU 占用率减少了将近 10% 呢！
