Surprisingly, I was hit by the news that <a href="https://medium.com/nem-sea/malaysian-degrees-to-be-notarized-and-authenticated-on-nem-via-luxtag-2584a897b9cc">Malaysia’s Education Ministry start to use blockchain technology to a Degree verification system</a>, called the <strong>e-Scroll system</strong>. This was going a little bit against with my impression that the Gov has always lagged behind the tech and being inefficient. Not sure if the Gov was improving or just I favour everything that has something to do with blockchain.

Undoubtedly this is a brilliant way of utilizing the decentralized ledger by releasing University Degree via a tamper-proof method. Fraudulent academic degrees issue could be tackled in no time and with least effort given the partnered blockchain network(in this case it is NEM) is matured enough.

<blockquote>
  Currently, Malaysian universities received thousands of requests globally to verify their graduates, but the process is still largely done via telephone and emails which are very inefficient.

</blockquote>

In the future(or now), employers would just have to search through the transparent ledger thru tools like data explorer to verify the authenticity of its job applicants, without having to deal with a human at all. And the best thing is it seems like the system is already up and running. One just has to access the site and <em>verify a product</em> via scanning QR code or keying product ID:

Simple UI and straight-forward operation style. Too bad I don't know any graduate from International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) to try this service out.

令人意外和惊喜的是，马来西亚高等教育机构居然和区块链这种前卫的技术搭在一起了，实在是让我这个每次对政府机构诟病不已的人大跌眼镜。<a href="https://medium.com/nem-sea/malaysian-degrees-to-be-notarized-and-authenticated-on-nem-via-luxtag-2584a897b9cc">高教部在 NEM 的架構下推出了教育文憑的系統</a>，這意味著以後雇主將不需要致電或電郵給大學機構來確認求職者的文憑真實性，直接在類似這樣的<a href="https://e-scroll.iium.edu.my/#/">工具</a>輸入相關資料就可以查閱，方便大家的同時還打擊了假文憑的惡劣事件。這也是另一個凸顯簡單的區塊鏈技術就足以解決棘手的信任問題，棒棒哒！<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/malaysia-starts-issuing-bachelor-degree-cert-via-nem-wish-i-could-have-my-certificates-on-the-blockchain-as-well/</em><hr/></center>
