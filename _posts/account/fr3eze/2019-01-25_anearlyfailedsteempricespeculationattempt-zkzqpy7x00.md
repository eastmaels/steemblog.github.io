Finally the long waited 1st batch of powered down Steem has been liquided yesterday, the main purpose of this powering down was to speculate on the spiking of Steem price which I'm shorting for quite a while.

But damn, Steem price seems like started to crash down from the "ATH" $0.43 few day ago and now hanging around $0.35, what a coincidence. Now I'm not sure whether I should just sell the liquid Steem now or just staying put.

Timing the market was never fun but I guess Steem should belong under the $0.30 line. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/a-nearly-failed-steem-price-speculation-attempt/ </em><hr/></center>
