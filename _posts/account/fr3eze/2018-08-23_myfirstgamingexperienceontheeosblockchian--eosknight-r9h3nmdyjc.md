Introduced by @fundurian the <a href="https://game.eosknights.io/">EOSKnight</a> is really quite a good real-time mini game base on EOS. This is probably my first ever interactive game ever played on the blockchain and I would say the concept is quite impressive. I picked up some knowledge along the way while setting up the game as well, good opportunity to get to know more about the EOS system.

Protip: Stake more CPU in the account or else you will keep hitting the annoying <em>low CPU</em> error message like this. Every movement in the game consumes CPU just so you know.
