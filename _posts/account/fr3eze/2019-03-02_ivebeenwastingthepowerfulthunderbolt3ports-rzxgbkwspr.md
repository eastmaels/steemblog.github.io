I've been using this Thunderbolt3 enabled MacBook Air for few months. Both the TB3 ports has only been utilised for one purpose, <strong>charging the laptop itself</strong>. No data transferring, no display exporting or any other purposes other than charging. The reason is simple, I simply don't have a Type C to Type C cable yet.

There has been some occasions that I would like to utilise the port for simple data transferring and to no vail at the end as there is no suitable tools available. Maybe I should at least get a Type A adapter for temporary usage. Such a waste leaving those powerful ports untouched. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/ive-been-wasting-the-powerful-thunderbolt3-ports/ </em><hr/></center>
