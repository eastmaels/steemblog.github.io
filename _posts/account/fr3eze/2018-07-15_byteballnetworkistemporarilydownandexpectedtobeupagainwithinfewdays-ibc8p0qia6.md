<h2>Byteball network down</h2>

Thanks to the ultra active Steem community, Byteball is probably undergoing the heaviest stress test the network never experienced before right after the announcement of Steemian attestation.

Fund sending in Byteball and the Steem attestation bot is all halted currently since yesterday afternoon.

<h2>3k of successful Steem attestation</h2>

To be exact, it is 3160 Steem attestors currently which you can check at https://byteball.co/attestors.

Given over a million of registered users on Steem and over 50k active uaers everyday, 3160 Steem attestors seems negligible and in the other words it means there are a LOT of pending attestation due to the congested traffic.

<h2>Network expected to be up again in a few days</h2>

According to the admins from official Byteball Telegram channel, this issue is something never experienced before and the expected resolve time could be few days.

You can follow the Byteball Slack chat for technical updates as well.

Be patient if your transaction or attestation is not going through right now. It will be resolved soon as the devs already working hard on it.

<h2>I see this as a good thing in long term</h2>

You do not improve a product without first breaking it. Current issue will strengthen Byteball integrity ar the cost of temporary downtime. Not to mention it is proven to be a great promotion to all Steemians, anyone is not aware of Byteball yet?

If you are the first-time user, send me your Byteball address following this (post)[https://steemit.com/steempress/@vornix/bestcryptostorycontestwithatotal6sbdprize-a1wwiauon6] and I shall cover your registration fee for free.

However, <strong>request will be denied if you have asked for Bytes giveaway from others.</strong> No Bytes-hunting here.

<hr />

<strong>TLDR</strong>: Byteball network is currently unworkable and expected resolved time would be within a few days. Be pateint for the Steem attestation.

<strong>太长没读</strong>：Byteball 网路目前处于停止状态，Steem 认证和转账等功能一并不能使用。程序人员已经着手解决问题，消息指出<strong>数日内</strong>应该可以恢复正常。还没认证的朋友们请耐心等候。
