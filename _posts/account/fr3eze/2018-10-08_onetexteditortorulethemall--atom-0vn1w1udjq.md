Notepad++ has been my favourite choice of recording ideas or drafting my Steem post whenever I'm on my desktop. Recently due to the need some simple development, I start to look for something more powerful that than the Notepad++(it is still my favourite for the sake of simplicity and lightweight).

<h2>Atom impressed me a ton!</h2>

<a href="https://atom.io/#ide">Atom</a> almost meets all of my requirement as a dream text editor:

<ul>
<li><strong>Open-source</strong></li>
</ul>

Oh yeah, I have indescribable love toward all the open-source projects and products! Community support, rapid development, <strong>free of charge</strong>, lively product, and more.

<ul>
<li><strong>Ultra-customizable</strong></li>
</ul>

If you like to make things truly yours, Atom is the text editor for you! Even if you are not, the default setting is so powerful that might be the only tool you need in a small to medium project!

<ul>
<li><strong>Powered by Github and strong community</strong></li>
</ul>

Tons of plugins to make Atom more than just a text editor. The famous <a href="https://atom.io/packages/linter">Linter</a> catch programming syntax error while coding in real-time. <a href="https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview">Markdown Preview</a> is my favourite package allowing to live preview the markdown post in the making. There is a lot for useful gems in the repo!

<ul>
<li><strong>Damn sleek and modern design</strong></li>
</ul>

While packed with almost thousand of features, the Atom is probably the sleekest (as sleek as notepad) and powerful text editor I've ever tried. It is just like the Notepad++ on the steroid.

This tool has way more to offer than what I've covered as mentioned above and it is one of the most loved products amongst the devs. They definitely have more weight in their opinion to use Atom as a development tool.

Check it out even if you are just going to use it as a pure text editor for Steem blogging!<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/one-text-editor-to-rule-them-all-atom/</em><hr/></center>
