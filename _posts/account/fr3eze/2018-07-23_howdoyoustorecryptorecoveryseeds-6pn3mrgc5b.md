<h2>Metal Bitcoin Seed Storage Stress Test</h2>

I've come across this <a href="https://medium.com/@lopp/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test-21f47cf8e6f5">interesting article</a> by stress testing all the physical metal seed storages. Those storages basically are just a 'paper-wallet' that made with metal, engraving private keys or seed phrases onto the metal plate for more robust storing purpose. And the only one I know is the famous <a href="https://cryptosteel.com/">Cryptosteel</a> out of the long list.

In the stress test, the <a href="https://cryptokeystack.com/">Crypto Key Stack</a> and <a href="https://bitkee.com/">Bitkee</a> stands out exceptionally after the torture of heating, corrosion, and crushing.

<h2>Not using one yet for my seeds</h2>

The main tool for seed storing I'm using now will be the Keepass for now, it is a open-source password manager and makes a great tool for crypto private data management as well. It might not be as great as those metal physical storages but it excels in portability and accessibility. I often need to refer to those key from time to time for daily operation, one of the great example is the owner key of my Steem account.

<h2>Maybe I will use the metal storage one day when I have more than enough stakes on the digital money</h2>

Yes I admit that most of my wealth are crypto-related curently, but I'm comfortable with the security measurements I've been taken at the same time. Unless I won the next crypto jackpot equivalent to 100000 BTC, I should stay with the same setting.

How do you protect your crypto seed?

<hr />

<a href="https://cryptokeystack.com/">Crypto Key Stack</a> 和 <a href="https://bitkee.com">Bitkee</a> 在这项残酷的测试中脱颖而出，成为最能抵抗外力破坏的金属钱包。目前为止我也只是用 Keepass 来管理种子和加密货币的敏感信息而已，虽然安全性逊色了点，在方便和好用的程度上是远远大过金属钱包。或许有天当我有了 100000 BTC, 会考虑入手一个 Bitkee?

你是怎么保管种子的呢？
