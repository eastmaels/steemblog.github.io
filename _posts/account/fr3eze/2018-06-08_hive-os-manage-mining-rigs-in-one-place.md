## Hunter's comment
Hive OS is a Linux based one stop monitoring and management platform for mining rigs. It aims to solve the pain management process of running multiple mining rigs at the same time. 

#### Save tons of effort managing the rigs

With the help of Hive OS, you can see all the rigs status in one place. With all the hashrates, online status, hardware errors and managing different wallets. Administration work like rebooting system, overclocking GPUs is also supported using merely the tools within. A wide range of GPUs has been tested working fine with Hive including NVIDIA GeForce card family, AMD Radeon RX(Vega is still under development), and even ASIC like the S9, S9i, L3+, L3++ and so on.

#### Popular miners are pre-installed

15 famous miners like Claymore, ETHminer, Bminer Equihash, and XMR-Stak are pre-installed on the platform so the user can skip the hassle of installing each one by one manually from the GitHub. This is the utmost important for miners with wider interest and does not stick to solely mining for a single coin. 

If you are running 10 rigs at the same time and decided to switch all the hash power for mining another algorithm, there is no centralised manner but to log in each rig one by one and do the necessary changes. With Hive OS everything can be done within clicks.

#### Multiple Watchdogs and monitoring services are supported

Telegram bot service will be used to allow user notified of the mining farm performance. Notification will be sending out every time in the event of GPU errors, low hashrates or high electricity consumption. Besides that, watchdogs like WatchdogInUa, OpenDev, Esonics can be added on top of Hive OS as long as they support Linux.

### Verdict

Managing mining rigs has never been this easy with the presence of Hive OS. The starting package is free for up to 3 rigs and beyond that, it would be $3 per month for each rig. I would say the cost is nothing for the time and effort being saved, what do you think about this platform?
