I was in a need to design a simple a web page as quickly as possible without going to the learning curve of HTML and CSS again. Drag-and-drop website builder will be the top choice in this case. Since most of the visual website builders are available as online service, that means they are mostly base on subscription plan which I did not plan to dive in yet. After all, I just need a simple one-page web page with the least complexity.

<h2>I thought Adobe Muse was a great choice</h2>

Despite the End-Of-Life announcement that Adobe Muse is going to stop and remove from the Adobe product list soon, existing users can still continue to build a website on it. Muse is also the only <strong>standalone web page builder</strong> I've found through some intensive research which makes it my first priority to try as I have [some ways](https://steemit.com/piracy/@fr3eze/piracy-with-conscious-adobe-photoshop-and-illustrator) to pirate the Adobe Cloud(shameful and I know it).

Like any other visual-based web page builder, Muse biggest selling point was <strong>build a website without coding at all</strong>. The famous Adobe brand gave me confidence that this product would be worthwhile if I invest some solid learning hours on it.

<h2>I was dead wrong</h2>

After spending 3 to 4 days of googling, watching tutorials, and experimenting on the product itself. I gave up.

<ul>
<li>While you might be able to crack the Muse, it requires a valid Adobe account connection to use the Adobe Typekit to use the font database which is crucial to the design.</li>
<li>Since this is a drag-and-drop site with very limited coding ability, one will mainly depend on the ready-made <strong>widgets</strong> which is often selling independently on a widget market.</li>
<li>Since my ultimate goal is to draft the web page and export HTML code for hosting purpose, people said the Muse generated code was <strong>dirty as hell</strong>.</li>
<li>The software <strong>learning curse is steep</strong>, especially there is only minimal tutorial and support resource available online.</li>
<li>Picking up the software skill's at such difficulty might not worth it since it is going to be obsolete soon anyway.</li>
</ul>

I wish I could spend the time and effort somewhere else for the simple site building, seriously. <strong>Stop looking at the Muse if you are about to explore the world of web development like me</strong>.

On top of that, I found <strong>Webflow</strong> suits most of my need with a really intuitive interface and awesome tutorials. More on that in the next post I guess.

Have a great day!<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/thumbs-down-to-the-adobe-muse-look-elsewhere-web-developers/</em><hr/></center>
