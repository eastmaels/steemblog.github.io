<h3>Exhausting first week</h3>

Just passed my first week in the new job with way longer travel time. It was more exhauting than I thought it would be, completely skipped my workout schedule in the week days, and I have not even start to take up the real responsibility yet! I guess I just got too comfortable on the previous job and this is the result of staying in my little comfort zone for too long. Nothing is wrong with the new job scope and in fact, I like what I'm about to hand on in the coming tasks.

<h3>Recent bull on the crypto market</h3>

I went from scrolling endlessly in the crypto-subreddit, and checking out Coinmarketcap everyday just to keep up with the latest news and trend in this ever-changing space, to a chilled monk who just casually check out the price whenever I was reminded by external factor. Had no a single clue what was behind this recent bull, probably <em>market cycle</em> could explain everything. It doesn't matter what cause it to rise, as long as it is rising. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/everything-is-bulling-except-steem/ </em><hr/></center>
