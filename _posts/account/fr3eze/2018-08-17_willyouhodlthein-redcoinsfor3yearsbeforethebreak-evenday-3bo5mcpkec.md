I'm not suggesting the history can aid any kind of prediction but people always refer to the history for a reason. And the fact is, I witnessed history repeating a few times in front of my eyes especially in the trading field. Below is the picture of Bitcoin price chart from the peak of 2013 to 2017.

So if you bought crypto in Nov 2013 and hodling since you will have to wait till Feb 2017 which is almost <strong>3 years</strong> to break even. Interesting fact indeed. Although this fact is not practically meaningful in future price prediction but it will be fun to swap the current position to that case.

I believe many of us here bouht crypto here and there during the market all time high Dec 2017 including myself. So if the market were to take 3 year to recover to the previous all time high level which is 800B total marketcap/ $20k per BTC, how strong is your hand to HODL?<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/will-you-hodl-the-in-red-coins-for-3-years-before-the-break-even-day/</em><hr/></center>
