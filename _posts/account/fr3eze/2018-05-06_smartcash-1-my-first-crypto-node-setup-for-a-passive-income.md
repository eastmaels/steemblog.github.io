## Why running a node?

Crypto has been a large part of my life since I took the dive one year ago. I was deeply amazed how it could change one's life completely, especially from the finance aspect. I never stop to looking for ways to increase my holding in BTC, thicken my overall net worth every day. There are already tons of way to earn coins or tokens and if I have to count things that I've done throughout the journey, it would be:

- Day trading with altcoins pair
- Join airdrops event
- Creating contents in Steem
- Hold coins for a medium or long-term and sell for profit

I think it is time to try something new. Running a node will be a totally different path in generating income and I regard that as one of the more immersive ways to get involve in a particular project.

Also, my system admin profession could be helpful in setting up nodes and this already sounds exciting to me as I'm already maintaining and setting up servers in the normal day job but to have my own machine that literally printing money? Sounds like a dream.

## Why SmartCash?

Learning from the [MasterNodes.online](https://masternodes.online/) and several SmartCash communities, [SmartCash](https://smartcash.cc/) has the following advantages:

- SmartCash has over 11k nodes running shows that it has a strong communities support.
- [GitHub activity](https://github.com/SmartCash/smartcash/graphs/commit-activity) is not ultra active but not too bad either. Here is the [list](https://smartcash.blockchainlibrary.org/2018/04/exploring-smartcash-projects-on-github-quick-community-roundup/)for their GitHub repo.
- **SmartRewards** allows the holder to get 15% of the block rewards every 30 days without any withdrawal. Killer features, much like the Power-up system in Steem to encourage faith.
- SmartNode(their naming for node) will get 10% of Block Reward, on top of the SmartRewards.
- SmartNode only requires 10,000 SMART for operation. Pricing at $0.114 now, a node will just cost $1,140 excluding other minor costs.

- SMART just took a dive today and I see it as a good point of entry(I've passed the age to buy coins only in green.)

- The team has just [announced](https://twitter.com/scashofficial?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcoinmarketcap.com%2Fcurrencies%2Fsmartcash%2F) their new privacy-oriented coin - BitcoinConfidential which will be airdropped to SmartCash owner at 10:1 ratio. Though I'm not impressed by the lame name, still a added bonus for entering now.

- To my surprise the team has an official account on Steem - @smartcash. I love Steem, and that makes me love those who embrace Steem.

## Verdict

I will make this a series to record my SmartNode journey. This is very much high risk experimental act and I'm prepared to loss all the fund invested. Do your own research as this is not a financial advice.
