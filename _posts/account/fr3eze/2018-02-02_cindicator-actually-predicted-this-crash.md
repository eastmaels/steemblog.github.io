7 days ago, in the post [Crypto market cap fall below 400B in Feb? ](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@fr3eze/crypto-market-cap-fall-below-400b-in-feb)I shared the first indicator I got from the Cindicator bot with the question:


>In your opinion, will the Market Cap fall below 400B at any time before February 28?

And the indicator was **65.25%** which could interpret as **high probability indicator; the probability for the event to happen is high.**

By the time this indicator was given out the Market Cap was around 550B and I was kind of disappointed with the bot performance. Because I don't think a 33% steep fall like that could be happening, and I proceeded to *bought the dip* as I thought we were already at the bottom.

Oh dear, this is already happening. Combined with all the negative news and FUD and shits, the market plunged at least 100B in a single day! I have a real complicated feeling towards this situation. A little worried about my investment while truly amazed by the accuracy of the indicator provided by Cindicator bot. 

Those guys from Cindicator actually forecasted this way before this was showing any sign of happening! At least I couldn't tell at all a steep crash like this was incoming. And this is a great example of the "wisdom of the crowd" that Cindicator believe in.

I received the indicator, I didn't believe it, I ignore it, and it happened. If only I did something in favor of the indicator I could have bought back those coins I'm holding for 30%. But yeah, there is no 'if only'.

Maybe I should take the Cindicator Bot more seriously next time.

七天前，我在[《 二月大泄？》](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@fr3eze/crypto-market-cap-fall-below-400b-in-feb)这篇文章介绍了我在 Cindicator Bot 收到的第一个指标，问题如下：

>加密货币总市值在二月二十八之前，有没有可能在任何一个时间点跌破 4000 亿美金？

当时的总市值是 5500 亿，而指标竟然是 **65%** 也意味着**这件事情很有可能会发生**。说实话，乍一看到这指标我心里是失望的，因为我对 Cindicator 的期望是很高，而他们处理出来的指标却如此不靠谱。要知道 5500 跌到 4000 可是 33% 的大崩溃，在市场已经滑落一波的前提下，我真的不看好这件事情会发生。

**然后就真的发生了**。

还是在短短七天里面就发生了。我的心情是相当复杂的，一方面开始有点小小担心自己的资产，同时却又对 Cindicator Bot 指标的准确性惊叹不已！这是我首次见证**大众智慧**的一次。

我收到指标，我不信它，我忽视它，然后它就发生了。看来我还是太年轻了。~~要是我听话的话，现在起码赚了30%。~~
