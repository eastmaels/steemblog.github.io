SP delegation is a well-known way to earn some of the best profit out of your SP. This method is especially suitable for those who are lazy to be active in the socializing, lazy to vote for curation reward, lazy to write posts for author reward, and so on. Delegating all the SP away not only can skip all those 'troubles' but also make a nice profit out from the delegation.

@minnowbooster and @smartsteem are two biggest reliable platforms for SP delegation as far as I experienced, though they implementing different mechanism. The former using leasing contract method with a fixed delegation days while the latter allows the delegation lasts as long as the user wishes.

##  Math time to compare revenue

There is a *Calculate Revenue* button at the [site](https://smartsteem.com) which is very handy in calculating profit for SP delegation. Type in any amount of SP and it will tell you the estimated revenue in 3 forms: Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Profit.

While [minnowbooster site](https://www.minnowbooster.net/market) clearly shows the specification of each *Lease Request* in a table view. Leasers can easily choose to fill whatever offer they like.

For easier comparison, we only compare the revenue generated on **monthly basis**. Current exchange rate for SBD/STEEM will be used for rate conversion, `1 SBD = 1.053 STEEM`.

### Comparison 1

This is 4 weeks lease request on Minnowbooster where the user request for 102 SP while leaser can receive an effective payment of 2.52 STEEM.

Input 102 in the 'Steempower' column on the Startsteem revenue calculator, we can tell that the monthly revenue is 3.246 SBD. `3.246*1.053 = 3.418 STEEM`. 

**3.418 STEEM from Smartsteem and 2.52 STEEM from Minnowbooster.**

Round 1, Smartsteem wins!

### Comparison 2

In Smartsteem we could get 30.961 SBD for the same amount of delegation. `30.961*1.053  = 32.602 STEEM`. 

**32.602 STEEM vs 24 STEEM**. That is as much as 33% bonus! Smartsteem wins again.

### Comparison 3

Now let's take a look at larger SP delegation request which is 4865 SP for the price of 150 STEEM from Minnowbooster.

We got 154.806 SBD from the Smartsteem. `154.806*1.053 = 163.011 STEEM`. You would earn extra 13 STEEM here.

Smartsteem still got the victory in the end!

## Conclusion

**@smartsteem is obviously the best choice now from the revenue perspective for SP delegation.**

Although it was mainly based on the advantage of paying SBD, which is hugely strayed away from the USD pegging mechanism for very long time. However judging from the SBD past behavior, receiving payment in SBD could be very rewarding as well if you look at their potential to skyrocket to last ATH at 14 USD, which was once `1 SDB = 9 STEEM`. 

Hope this could make your life easier in choosing which platform to delegate your SP. If you know some other better sites, let me know in the comment.

SP 委托代理是懒人在 Steem 赚钱的最佳方法，@minnowbooster 和 @smartsteem 是目前最大也是我使用过的平台，它们都接受 SP 代理然后付费给代理者。那么哪家的回酬更高呢？

经过上面一系列的比较，显而易见 [Smartsteem](https://smartsteem.com) 是更好的选择！平均收入要比 minnowbooster 高出起码 10%！
