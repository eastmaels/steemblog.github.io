## Hunter's comment
This is another great table "framework" for web developer who would like to build a fully responsive table with complex data. Responsive Tables allows developer to decide which column to show first using a priority definition on each column.Button dropdown enables users to show/hide whichever columns.

Implementation is easy and requires only Bootstrap 3 and jQuery. It even works on outdated or browsers without JS enabled.
