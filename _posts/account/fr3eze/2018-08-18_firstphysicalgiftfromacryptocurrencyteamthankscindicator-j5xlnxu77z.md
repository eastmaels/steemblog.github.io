3 months ago I participated in a writing contest about the <a href="https://steemit.com/cindicator/@fr3eze/why-do-i-making-forecast-in-cindicator">Cindicator Insight Challenge</a> talking about how do I feel about this project as a crypto predictor. I was having fun back then predicting crypto future events every day so taking part in that contest was a perfect match after I picking up the <em>writing every day</em> habit on Steem.

I was lucky enough to qualify for the <a href="https://steemit.com/cindicator/@fr3eze/i-m-finalised-in-cindicator-insight-challenge">finalized 5 picks</a> later and I never felt so excited to be so closed in winning my first huge crypto contest(5 ETH). I did not win it though, not even made it into final top 3 ranks. A little bit disheartening but I had fun in the process and that's what matters the most.

But Cindicator team decided to surprise me in the other way. Knocking off from the office last Friday and went home only to find out this generous gift from the team. Check it out.

Let's end this post with the cool message from the Cindicator team on the nice Moleskine notebook. This is probably my first time to receive something physical crypto-related stuff from a third-party and made me feel that crypto was not as virtual as I thought it is. Thanks Cindicator, I appreciate the surprise very much!

三个月前参加的 <a href="https://steemit.com/cindicator/@fr3eze/why-do-i-making-forecast-in-cindicator">Cindicator Insight Challenge</a>有幸最后进入了<a href="https://steemit.com/cindicator/@fr3eze/i-m-finalised-in-cindicator-insight-challenge">最后五强</a>。 可惜最后还是没有机会赢取大奖，但是 Cindicator 团队却以另一个形式来~~安慰~~给我一个惊喜。前几天下班回家收到了这个来自遥远的俄罗斯的包裹，里面包含了以背包和衣服为主的数十样礼物，上面都印有 Cindicator 的标志。这应该是我第一次拥有物理的来自第三方的 crypto 物件，顿时感觉加密货币好像也不是我想象般虚拟呢。谢啦，Cindicator！<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/first-physical-gift-from-a-cryptocurrency-team-thanks-cindicator/</em><hr/></center>
