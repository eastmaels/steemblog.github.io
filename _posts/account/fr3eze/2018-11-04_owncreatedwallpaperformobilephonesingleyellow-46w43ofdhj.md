I was constantly searching and practive new style of my art journey. Fortunately, after owning an "artist sword" -- the iPad Pro and Apple Pencil, the possibility has expanded to a much wider scope.

I'm always a big fan of minimalism art style, especially in choosing my devices wallpaper. So why not create my own minimal wallpaer with the help of one of the greatest digital art tools?

<h2>This is a wallpaper full of layers</h2>

I named this wallpaper <strong>"Single Yellow（单黄）"</strong>. The main theme is simple, cloud, mountain, and sun are the 3 main elements in the structure. As one can obviously told, not less than 10 layers was applied on this wallpaper.

There are 3 versions for this wallpaper. The first one is the most clean and fundamental one without any color gradient at all at each layers.

The secind version has the color gradient applied with the help of <em>splatter</em> style. Given this version a rough and raw feel.

The last version, also is my most liked version having the airbrushed shadow for layers looks pretty natural and rich in "layerness".
