I never cash out the author reward into fiat since the day I started writing here. The most I did with the reward was just trading STEEM/SBD, or buy some Cardano with the hot SBD which obviously turned out to be a great buy-in surging from $0.13 to $0.4 as of now. This makes me never realize how profitable for Steemit writer given the recent SBD frenzy and rise of STEEM price. 

I'm a Malaysian where the national average salary is about [RM4279 (about US$987)](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/average-monthly-salary-of-malaysians-has-dropped-to-nearly-rm4280/) per month. How much should I make in the author reward if I wish to make a living out of SBD?

## Let's do the math

Assumptions:

- There are 30 days in a month
- Make one post every day
- Rewards payout in (50%/50%)

In order to make $987 (about RM4279), I will have to make `987/30 = $32.9` per day.

One SBD equals to $11.35 at the moment, I will need to make **3 SBD** if I author a post every day.

According to the formula,

`Author reward in SBD = (Total post payout * 0.75)/2`

We know that we are going to make 3 SBD hence the formula to find out `Total post payout` will be

`Total post payout = (3*2)/0.75`

And the answer is **$8** that we are going to score a post.

## Thoughts

With some consistency, one can easily hit that $8 average payout. You can pull that number drastically up to at least $20 by being a quality contributor for @utopian-io. Not to mention that you can combine tricks like buying or selling votes, renting SP, or [making use of quality service like @qurator](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@fr3eze/get-free-upvotes-without-spending-sp-and-sbd-qurator) to score consistent upvotes.

This is quite mind-blowing considering all one has to do is to make an average $8 payout to match our national average income at RM4279. In fact, most of my fellow Malaysians are not even making that much in their current job (under 30 years old).

Keep writing and the surprise will be waiting for you ahead.

我从没把 Steemit 上赚到的钱提现，在最近 Steem 发力和 SBD 疯狂发力之下，想算一算到底需要多少 SBD 才抵得上马来西亚的人均收入。

### 算法

前提：一个月里有三十天，每天发一篇文，用 50/50 作为奖励方式。

马来西亚的平均月收入大约为美金 $987，意味着我每天必须赚取987 (近 RM4279)，意味着我每天必须赚取 `987/30 = $32.9`。

一个 SBD 目前价格为 $11.35，那就是每一篇文都必须有 3 SBD 的分成。 参考以下的公式，

`Author reward in SBD = (Total post payout * 0.75)/2`

把 **3** 代入 `Author reward in SBD` ，算得 Total post payout 的公式成了

`Total post payout = (3*2)/0.75`

答案就是 **$8**。

### 感想

平均每篇文 $8 真心不高，如果利用 @utopian-io 更可以大大提高到起码 $20。更不用说那些买卖赞和租借 SP 的小伎俩。[还有利用 Qurator 高素质服务也可收取一定的点赞](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@fr3eze/get-free-upvotes-without-spending-sp-and-sbd-qurator)。

事实上，身边的同龄朋友们（30岁以下）多数都没有达到所谓的平均月收入，这就让演算结果更让人震惊了。我所 follow 的写手中有好多每篇收入都是 30 以上，这样的收入目前而言想必在许多国家都很吃得开了。
