I'm getting sick of the wired mouse which occasionally restricts the mouse movement(maybe due to poor cable management). And I have a secondary computer(Macbook), so I think this Logitech MX Anywhere 2S could be a real solution for my case.

<h3>The **best **part about this mouse:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Wireless and very portable due to its small size, I like a small mouse.</li>
<li>It is rechargeable and ultra lasting, one full charge claims to last about 3 months. Have no comment on that yet as I was just using it for the second week.</li>
<li>It can be paired up to 3 devices. So my main desktop PC and MacBook can share the same mice seamlessly. Tested and it works like a charm. Super fast on pairing and almost no delay in the process.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The **gimmick **part about this mouse:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Flow feature is somewhat not necessary in real life. It sounds cool to use the same mouse across 2 different system without even switching the pairing. But I guess most of the people just won't utilize this feature.</li>
<li>The hyper scrolling feature. Not as useless as the Flow but I find it rather replaceable by the keyboard navigation key in the long document where a fast scrolling up and down is needed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The **bad **part about this mouse:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>The middle click is not working!</strong> Most annoying surprise when I found this out. The scroll button is not clickable and there is no way to use it as the average mouse like open a link in the new tab in a browser or so. I did a workaround by setting the side press of scroll button to mimic the middle click function. </li>
</ul>

By far I'm very satisfied with this mouse and it quite lives up to its fame except for the middle click part. I heard the MX Master series retain the middle click function but it is like 50% more expensive, also I'm afraid the bigger size of it will be another problem for me to get comfortable.

If you are still doing productivity stuff on a gaming mouse, you are doing it wrong. Give the Logitech MX series a try! <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/the-best-productivity-mouse/ </em><hr/></center>
