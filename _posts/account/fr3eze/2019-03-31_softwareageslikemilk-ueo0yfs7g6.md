Famously quoted by Joshua Corman(2015). Software including big stuff like operating system, framework, library and as small as it could go like simple tool, program, or script. All the software types mostly had some dependencies on external code which weren't written by the very creator himself. Although a very capable coder can code a perfect program, but the environment it runs on, the underlying frame work it is using, could go wrong as more security holes can be found as time pass.

That's why it is better to stay away from an abandoned software which receives zero maintenance and updates. That aged software might not cause the diarrhea right away, but it would at some point in future. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/software-ages-like-milk/ </em><hr/></center>
