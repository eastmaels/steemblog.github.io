Looking at the price chart of new iPhone every time during the new announcement, sometimes it really reminds me the ultra bullrun in the 2017 Q4.

<center>Looks pretty much the same, no?</center>

In Singapore the highest spec of iPhone Max would roughly cost around 2k SGD which could easily be one month worth of the average wages. Converting this analogy to Malaysia, people might need to save up <strong>3 months of salary without spending a cent just to buy a phone!</strong> I could just buy tons of good with that amount of money, even my performance desktop PC cost about the same and it could mine some coins for me when I'm not using it. Can iPhone do the same? LOL

Same applies to the high end Android phones as well. The price spiking curve is never in sync with the new features/functionality of new gen phone, aren't the price for new feat is dropping due to our tech advancement?

Apparently I don't get the point at all at this pricing level. Nor I'm the fans of Apple. If you are one, just give me a reason why you are willing to get one out of your own pocket money.<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/new-iphone-is-a-touchstone-for-ifag/</em><hr/></center>
