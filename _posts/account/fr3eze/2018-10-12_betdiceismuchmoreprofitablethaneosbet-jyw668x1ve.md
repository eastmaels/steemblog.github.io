If you are interested in betting via crypto, chances are you might be already familiar with both the applications available on top of the EOS network. BetDice and EOSBet are both the top 5 active Dapp according to the <a href="https://dappradar.com/eos-dapps">DappRadar</a>.

I was introducing the idea of crypto usage to some friends yesterday and guess online betting would be a great showcase(or not) of crypto power. They were amazed at the same time the gambling gene inside of me just got triggered since my last betting a long time ago.

<h2>Poured 100+ EOS on both games.</h2>

I had several hours of gaming session with both games so I guess this fun review would somehow making some sense although not really reliable.

I started with the EOSBet and the luck was really bad, or I should say there was no luck at all. Won 10 something EOS at most then lost straight down to -50 EOS.

On the BetDice however, things work almost in a completely opposite direction. Won close to 100 EOS not only that I covered previous loss in EOSBet but making some nice profit within 1 hour I guess. Although in the end, I lost half of the profit back, the overall betting fund was back to square at least.

<strong>Personally, I strongly favour the BetDice as I think the random number algorithm is more <em>fair</em></strong>.

<em><strong>Caveats</strong>: Both games are not open-source not they are provably fair, these are the big red signs for any online betting system that is using cryptocurrency. Play at your own risk.</em><br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/betdice-is-much-more-profitable-than-eosbet/</em><hr/></center>
