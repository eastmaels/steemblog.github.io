Passed by this interesting <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">article</a> while trying to get my hands dirty installing a Linux system the hardcore way. This particular article is teaching how to deal with your technical problems especially when you need to seek help from the geeks(or the <em>hackers</em> as described in the article).

The whole thing was written in a rather geeky and cold tone that educate the <em>idiots</em> who always ask stupid questions on the web. It was rather a long read and I have not yet finish it. But the following <em>do-before-you-ask</em> list is rather accurate and pretty much spells that, <em>probably you shouldn't ask that question at all</em>.

<pre><code>Before asking a technical question by e-mail, or in a newsgroup, or on a website chat board, do the following:

1. Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to.

2. Try to find an answer by searching the Web.

3. Try to find an answer by reading the manual.

4. Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.

5. Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.

6. Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.

7. If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.
</code></pre>

I doubt there would be still a need to ask the question after performing all mentioned 7 steps. But that was a great guideline before asking any tech question online though.

今天看到了一篇煞有其事的文章，名曰“<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">如何聪明的问个好问题</a>”。主要是针对电脑技术性的问题。整篇篇幅挺长的，我也还没读完，不过以下在开头处的引导阅读倒是挺有趣。翻译了一下：

<pre><code>在线上任何地方问技术性问题之前，请执行以下：
1. 尝试在想要发表问题的论坛上，先搜索你想要问的课题是否已经被问过。
2. 尝试在网上搜寻答案。
3. 尝试在使用手册里搜寻答案。
4. 尝试在*常见问题*里搜寻答案。
5. 尝试在实验和探索中搜寻答案。
6. 尝试在高手朋友中搜寻答案。
7. 如果你是程序员，尝试在源代码中搜寻答案。
</code></pre>

看完这七点之后，我寻思这似乎什么问题都可以自己解决了吧，还需要发帖求助吗？ <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/how-to-ask-questions-the-smart-way/ </em><hr/></center>
