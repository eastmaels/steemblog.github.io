Do you own a monitor either for home PC or workplace? Do you use them using the factory setting and doesn't think about the color calibration as long as it shows color?

Think again. Calibrating the monitor color could just make your monitor looks like new again.

I own the Dell U2717D for over a year now and all the while I thought it has a great out-of-box setting for the color management so I did not bother much tuning it. Furthermore, I'm not making graphics content or video editing for a living. Until I stumbled upon the idea of exploring the capability of this monitor and research for the recommended setting for it.

<h2>How?</h2>

<a href="http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/icc_profiles.htm#install">TFT Central</a> is an awesome site focus on testing and reviewing a wide range of monitors on the market. It hosts a database showing the optimal setting for each of the listed monitors and it is a <strong>long list</strong>. Chances to find yours on the list is pretty high.

The best thing is these configuration tweaks were tested via expensive colorimeter like <em>X-rite i1 Pro</em> and <em>LaCie</em> which the average guy will not have the skill to utilize. Most guys just never heard of it, including me.\

If you are new to screen calibrating, it would be great to read the <a href="http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/icc_profiles.htm#calibrate">simple guideline</a> to get the idea of what the site could be of help.

Basically, a user just has to <strong>configure the monitor on hardware level by pressing the buttons on the body</strong>, and secondly down the <strong>ICC profiles from the database with respect to the individual model.</strong>

The whole process would not take more than 10 min and it is <strong>free</strong>.

<h2>The result?</h2>

<strong>Noticeably nicer, way nicer.</strong> It's like peeling off the worn-out, blurry screen protector off the phone display and the old phone pretty much feels like new again. The monitor is now showing the color in a more accurate and natural tone. Simple trick but worth big time to implement it. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/give-the-monitor-a-new-life-by-color-calibration/ </em><hr/></center>
