When <em>living off the Steem</em> or any other cryptocurrency become nothing less than a dream, and the current day job is staggering at one's personal growth, looking for another day job is the only way out in most modern society.

Made my first resume for the current job I'm working on and never look back anymore. I wish I implemented the practice that always updating the resume and keep attending job interview even if I'm not intended to get the job. Best practice to keep my focus sharp and be aware of what the market is demanding.

Not at once I execute those correct practice, I called that the effect of the comfort zone. Time of getting out of it, and still hoping the day that I no longer need the corporate work life. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/first-job-hopping-makes-the-great-resolution-in-2019/ </em><hr/></center>
