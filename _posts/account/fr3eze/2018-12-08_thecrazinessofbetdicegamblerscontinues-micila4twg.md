After seeing the great surge of gambling volume on Betdice, I know this could be the best chance selling off my DICE token as the demand for the dividend would be greatly supported. Initialled the 24-hour unstaking process yesterday when I was making post about this <a href="https://steemit.com/crypto/@fr3eze/eoscrashedhardandcelebratedbyeosgamblers-x538a7c8xj">interesting gambling</a> due to the bear market.

It was completely unstaked this morning and ready to put on sale. God bless, the DICE trading value is going up constantly during the last 24 hours. Means the unstaking process is granting me more EOS for the sale.

By the time I had access to the computer, the price hit the all-time high 0.0044 EOS per DICE a few hours ago and got chilled back down to 0.0038 and that's my selling price for the 87k DICE tokens. It is anyway way more than the average 0.0027 for the last 7 days.

Checked out the <a href="https://betdice.one/exchange">trading market</a> a few hours later and it got back up to all-time high price again. Missed out the potential extra 10% gain but who would know right? It seems like the gamblers are betting like there is no tomorrow, which is a great news for DICE token holder as they are getting that fat dividend every hour. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/the-craziness-of-betdice-gamblers-continues/ </em><hr/></center>
