<a href="https://material.io/design/motion/understanding-motion.html#principles">Motion</a> is one of the biggest parts in creating an interactive UI, if not biggest. Doing it wrong or overdo it could spell a big disaster to the overall feeling one application gives to its users.

<ul>
<li><strong>Exiting and closing can have a higher speed than the opening animation</strong>. As it requires less user attention than the user's next task.</p></li>
<li><p>Relatively, <strong>animation of small area should use a shorter duration than those that traverse larger areas.</strong> For example, animation for icon has a duration of 100ms while a full screen popup could use 300ms.</p></li>
<li><p>Animation duration is best <strong>around 300ms</strong>. Make it shorter for a bolder feel, longer for a more relaxed effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the orientation to use by considering the motion of an expanding surface. <strong>The arc should match the primary scrolling axis of the UI.</strong> For example, a card in a vertically scrolling UI will expand using a vertical out arc. When the card collapses, the motion reverses, first moving vertically and then horizontally.</p></li>
</ul>

The Motion teaches tons of lesson that make sense and was a little bit overwhelming for my current standard to absorb it all. Definitely coming back to revise this chapter again when I had more experience in UX design. Great read! <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/material-design-motion-note/ </em><hr/></center>
