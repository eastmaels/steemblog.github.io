After some very 'intense' research I've decided to go for the Drevo Excalibur as my first mechanical keyboard. The friendly price tag put things in the sweet spot between budget and quality. As much as you may refer this is merely for the beginner due to the low price, the quality is not compromised at all.

## Unboxing ##

Solid packing + thick self-absorption wrap = perfect dent-free box

*Simple transparent dust cover*

Drevo Excalibur is a 75% keyboard with 84-key. This layout can be found mostly in laptop keyboard. Personally, I found this layout works best for me as I can get the Function key row and navigation keys while keeping the layout as compact as possible. Together with the borderless full metal body, granted this keyboard a really minimal and clean style.

The floating-key design makes things feel futuristic and you will be grateful for that when you are cleaning the keyboard. Dust and hair can be easily cleaned even without removing the keycaps, a simple air duster will make it clean like new.

One of the great points is that the keycaps are using double-shot technique in ABS material. The official claims that the keycaps have enhanced texture to prevent keys from getting greasy. But we can only tell over the time. It does bring a better feel than those normal keycaps I've been used.
However I'm not a fan of the too boastful font in gaming accent, but I can always get another set of keycaps and customise it.

This keyboard comes in 2 colors which are black and white. White version really makes the perfect match with the black extended mouse pad.

It also has white LED backlit with a couple of stunning lighting effects:

**Breathing mode**

**Reactive mode**

**Advanced reactive mode**

## Verdict

I've chosen the famous **Red switch** and I'm glad about the decision. It doesn't produce loud click-clack sound that might be annoying to the surrounding while providing a solid feedback. Solid build quality, rich in features, and you just can't ask more at the $65 price tag.

So far I've typed most of my Steemit posts with this gem and I couldn't be happier with the experience. If I have to suggest a way on how to improve your days as a blogger in Steemit, an investment in this keyboard would be my recommendation.
