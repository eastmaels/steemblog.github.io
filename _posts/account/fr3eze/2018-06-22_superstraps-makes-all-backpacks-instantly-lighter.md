# The pain of common backpacks

A common problem of ordinary backpack is the poor ergonomics because most of them are designed on other priority. How many times do you suffer the shoulder and neck pain by carrying the nice-looking and highly functional backpack? I own a backpack with the design that suits my needs perfectly but the biggest drawback is that was not designed for the best ergonomic experience. I could not take a long walk with it if the bag is considerably loaded. 

# The **SuperStraps** is the perfect solution

This lovely minimalist gadget simply just does one thing, **hoists the weight of your backpack closer to the spine**. And by doing so:

- Your backpack will **instantly feels much lighter** because the external weight is not pulling your upper body behind unnecessarily.
- Kiss goodbye to shoulder, back and neck pain after a long hour of ergonomic carry. 
- Walk with **great posture** even with a heavy bag sounds like a dream, but it is now a reality.

Beside of all the goodies, SuperStraps comes with no drawbacks at all:

- Minimal design and leave hidden behind the straps, so it does not bother the overall beauty of backpack at all.
- The padding system is ultra cushy that might be more comfortable and friendly to the shoulder compared to original straps.
- The pully system can be activated/deactivated easily without help from others. It claims to be as simple as zipping pants.
- Ultra universality that fit all kind of backpack.

The best part is, **you can still keep your favourite backpack while improving the comfort enormously!**
