Are you using a Solid State Drive on Windows? If yes, do yourselve a favor and check if the auto defragmentation option is turned on for the SSD along with other HDD. The SSD works differently from HDD and does not need defragmentation at all for performance optimization.

<h2>Turn off defragmentation for SSD now.</h2>

The recent computer class I attended reminded me this fact and I got this option turned on god-knows for how long. Dammit. SSD biggest weakness id they are having a finite number of writing operation to the disk itself.

Running disk defragmentation is the perfect way to wear SSD down and soon you will need to replace it. I'm pretty sure I did not turn on that optiom for my SSD partition and Win 10 should intelligently handle it but apparently it did not.

Pay attention to the costly SSD would you?<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/dont-ever-defragment-your-ssd/</em><hr/></center>
