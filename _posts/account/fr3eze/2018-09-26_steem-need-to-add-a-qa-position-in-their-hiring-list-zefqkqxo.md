Did not see the advantage of this hardfork yet but undoubtedly HF20 is a failure up to this point. This also exposed how fragile the DPOS blockchain system is, it is possible to go down while the Bitcoin with ancient blockchain tech never went though event like this even for a single second. 

Also I cannot understand why something buggy at such level would not be discovered in thw testing phase. Don't we have a testnet?

Please beware that the Steem reputaion is at stake on such even @steemitblog.
