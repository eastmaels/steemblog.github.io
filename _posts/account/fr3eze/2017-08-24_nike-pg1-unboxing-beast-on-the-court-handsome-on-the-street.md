The Nike PG1 is the first signature basketball shoe from NBA star Paul George. This shoe soon becomes a hot sale for its practicality and value. For the MSRP of $110 and the features generously packed on the PG1, I would say it is the king for this budget. I got mine from Footlocker during a flash sale for 25% discount which makes the deal even sweeter.

Finally, I have my first pair of signature shoe and let's do a quick unboxing. Unique box design with the PG logo on top of it. Simplistic design but the box quality is no better than normal Nike shoe box.

The shape of 13 printed at the rear sole representing Paul George jersey number. 

PG logo at the front of tongue.

Nike logo in suede leather feeling.

The short strap does help in tightening fore foot but I don't utilize this too much as I have fatter fore feet already. But they do complement in the aesthetic and I love how the little bluish tag highlights the overall look.

Tongue-less design offers a complete wrap-up feeling

PG's personal signature at the inner sole, which I don't think can survive for even a game.(And I was right, brushed completely off after a game session)

Outsole in my favorite brown color and PG logo at the middle. Solid rubber with good traction and I heard they are tough on the court. Let's hope it will last longer so I don't have to buy another pair so soon.

All in all, I love the low-cut design and the promised performance for such a friendly price tag. Though I foresaw the outsole shall wear out much quicker while the other parts still looking new because I play on the outdoor court, I can retire them to be my street shoe for its aesthetic design!
