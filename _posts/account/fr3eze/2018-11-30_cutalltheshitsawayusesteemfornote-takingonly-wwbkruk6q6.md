Not every blogger on Steem are equal, just like there is no equality for all the human out there in real life. Steemit biggest marketing is that every content could be monetized. But that's really not the case for 90% of Steemians and if your post worth more than $1.00 you are probably in the top tier of the pyramid.

The wealth distribution will never be fair here. And not everyone enjoys flattering around for the sake of vote as the fact is "networking is king" in Steem. So how we can utilize the Steem except for the write-for-vote purpose?

<h2>Permanent notepad</h2>

Forget about the networking and socializing if that's not your cup of tea, Steem blockchain is a wonderful <strong>note-taking application</strong> that:

<ul>
<li>Store the text data forever as long as Steem still relevant.</li>
<li>Ultra high availability, would easily outlast what you have stored in Evernote.</li>
<li>Over 100 witnesses and hundreds of server running 24/7 to make sure your note is secured and available.</li>
<li>Cost zero resource for users. Zero disk space is needed even if you upload the whole series of Harry Potter ten times.</li>
<li>It is <strong>completely free</strong>.</li>
</ul>

With that said, if you don't mind making all your note public while sick of vote-hunting, why not taking Steem as <strong>another innovative notepad?</strong> <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/cut-all-the-shits-away-use-steem-for-note-taking-only/ </em><hr/></center>
