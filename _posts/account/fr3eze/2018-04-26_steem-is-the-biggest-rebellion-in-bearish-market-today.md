Steem is the only thing I found green in today's sea of red, even the strong EOS cannot resist the overall market downturn from 430B to 390B. 

Seems like the listing of STEEM on one of the most dominant exchange, Huobi(4th largest in term of trading volume), is make our dear Steem perform against the crypto bearish market.

I'm glad to be part of this rebellious trend.
