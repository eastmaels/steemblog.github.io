After <a href="https://steemit.com/computer/@fr3eze/thumbsdowntotheadobemuselookelsewherewebdevelopers-2lcliqntsw">hard earned lesson with Adobe Muse</a>, spending a little money on a worthwhile service that saves you tons of headaches and time is probably always the way to go. And <a href="https://webflow.com/">Webflow</a> is the best-paid service I could find that meets every one of my requirements:

<ul>
<li>Extremely easy to use interface</li>
<li>More customization than dummy website builder like Wix.</li>
<li>Relatively way lower learning curve than Muse and its competitors.</li>
</ul>

The best thing about Webflow is probably it is <strong>all free to use and host</strong> with some limitations of course. That means you study and try out the awesome website building tool for free all you want without paying a penny and even publish it with webflow domain.

Since my goal is just to use the builder tool to draft a website and later export it out the code. I can later subscribe to the cheapest monthly plan($16) and export the full code and then cancel it. The team is currently working on a <a href="https://forum.webflow.com/t/flexible-export-options-on-free-plan/17726">flexible export option on the free plan</a> which I think would come in great handy for a user like myself who just wanted to utilize the tool only. Not to mention that I heard Webflow <strong>generates clean codes</strong> which is really a bonus point to me.

<center>Export code interface. User can only preview limited codes on free plan.</center>

<center>I have to say their tutorial videos is one of the best I've been watched in a long while. Short, precise and sometimes accompanied with a humour sense. Love it!</center>

Looking forward to seeing what I can do with this awesome service!<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/webflow-the-best-drag-and-drop-website-builder-tool/</em><hr/></center>
