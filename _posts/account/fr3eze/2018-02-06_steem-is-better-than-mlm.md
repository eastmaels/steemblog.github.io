Multi-level marketing (MLM) to some company that does a great job at brainwashing people to work for the pyramid system.

>"Join us, all you have to do is find 3 downlines under you. And if each of them finding another 3 downlines, those downlines keep doing the same...you can be earning $100,000 passive income without having to work for a day!"

A company like Amway is dominating the MLM market in Malaysia for quite a long time, not sure they are still having the same dominance like old time. I never have interest in such pyramid scheme. Maybe I'm a decentralized guy who doesn't believe to solely depends on one source especially when it comes to income. Furthermore, I've seen too many examples of how my friends got brainwashed by the MLM tactics and accomplish nothing other than burning all his network down by hard-selling those products.

Guess they will do much better if they put the same dedication into Steem.

Phase|MLM| Steem
---|---|---
**Capital**|Often needed member to purchase one set of product prior to joining the organization and it could be expensive.|Zero capital to join.
**Attraction**|Money|Money, networks, knowledge, skill improvement, potential unleash
Join if want to|Earn money| Earn money, express talents, meet new friends, enjoy quality content
**Way of earning**|Pulling more downlines, selling more products| Do what you love to do. Writing, reading, filming(dTube), singing(dSound), joking(dMania), streaming(dlive), and more.
**Point of failure**|One. If the company is gone, your network is gone, your downline is gone, your income is gone|Decentralised, Steem blockchain stays forever.
**Side effect**|Burning network, wasting money and time if the system failed to work| Hmmm, tell me one?

多层次传销（Multilevel marketing，简称 MLM）对我来说就是一种很厉害的洗脑术。“你加入我们，拉三个下线，然后下线又拉三个下线，一年后就有年入 X 百万的被动收入了！”。每个传销的中心思想都离不开这种调调。

安利（Amway）在马来西亚很长时间里可是传销界中的霸主，不知道现在还是不是，反正我没兴趣。我不是很相信单一收入的概念，凡是都应该越多元越好，尤其是收入这方面。再加上身边几个朋友被洗脑全身投入这个“行业”到现在还一事无成，更是让我笃定了信念这东西不行。

突发奇想，要是他们把同样的力气投入在 Steem 上，说不定会活得更开心？

阶段|MLM| Steem
---|---|---
**成本**|要买产品才能加入，通常很贵|零成本。
**卖点**|赚钱|赚钱，人脉，知识见闻，技术深造，潜能释放
**动力**|赚钱| 赚钱，表现才能，认识新朋友，享受高品质作品
**赚钱方法**|找下线，卖产品| 做你喜欢做的：写文章，读文章，录影(dTube),，唱歌(dSound)，写段子(dMania)，直播(dlive)，更多更多。
**故障点**|单一。要是公司倒闭，你的人脉就完蛋，下线就完蛋，收入也完蛋。|去中心化，Steem 区块链永远存在。
**副作用**|消费人脉，如果最后一切归零的话就浪费钱和时间| 额，暂时想不到？
