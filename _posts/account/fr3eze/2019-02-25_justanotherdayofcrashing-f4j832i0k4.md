A sudden gain of 10B in total marketcap over a week, crash all the accumulated gain within a day, I guess we will be seeing trend like this all year long in 2019.  And I'm glad I grew numb towards it. It was obviously manipulated and that has been what the crypto is all about since the beginning. Be it stocks or gold or crypto, it doesn't really matters as long as the human are behind all these assets.

Human never change. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/just-another-day-of-crashing/ </em><hr/></center>
