I've been posting once every day for the past 1+ years since I join Steem and ditched the ordinary social media platforms. And being fully dedicated to my side project in spare time, I found some interesting habit has developed these days and that is, <strong>creating content is easier to be done on the weekdays than weekends.</strong>

I have a full-time day job from Mon to Fri while Sat and Sun are mostly free and will be my <em>side gig days</em>. In the normal busy(or not) working weekdays, it seems like I managed to squeeze out one hour or so for the content creating be it in the idle office hours or after work. However in the weekend when I working full force in either learning, coding, designing or whatever, I usually went all out that I don't want to stop the momentum to do something irrelevant, like writing a post on Steem.

Well, maybe task management is the next thing I should focus on studying. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/weekend-is-not-an-efficient-steem-posting-day-for-me-anymore/ </em><hr/></center>
