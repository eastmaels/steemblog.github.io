Weeks ago I did a write-up for the entry of Cindicator Insight Challenge sharing my thoughts in using the platform as crypto market predictor.

I have many reasons to write a 2000 word entry including the luxurious prizes(free trip to any crypto event in the world or 5ETH), sharing my love towards this awesome project, and hoping to promote Cindicator to the uninformed crowd.

It was not an easy task that I spend tremendous amount of effort in creating the content and touching up the typesetting. **I'm so pleased to be finalised in the final stage!**

>Now we’re excited to announce the five finalists in each category! You can find them in the Cindicator app - https://app.cindicator.com/ - there are two ranking questions pinned at the top. Your job is to vote for the best insights, arranging entries according to your preferences. The “Useful links” contains links to the original entries. You can vote until 18 May, 23:59 UTC. 

Brilliant way for the team to host the voting session using the ready-made Cindicator application which you can access to the very question using desktop:

https://app.cindicator.com/events/9d1ceef6-7b8d-4664-bbc2-bb5efcb873f4

Only the registered user can vote and you may treat this opportunity to join and know more about Cindicator. All the five finalist insightful articles should help you in understand more about this awesome project, you can read mine under the 'Useful link' or via link below:

前些日子写了一篇文章参加 Cindicator Insight Challenge 没想到居然被入选了最后五强！这篇文章主要讲述了作为预测者如何参与 Cindicator，以及种种好处，有兴趣的可以去看看(全英文):

可以通过[这里](
https://app.cindicator.com/events/9d1ceef6-7b8d-4664-bbc2-bb5efcb873f4)投票，前提是必须要有 Cindicator 账户才可进行操作。没有账户的朋友也可把这看作加入这大好平台的好时机，进入五强的文章都以各种方式呈现了这里的好玩之处，赶快加入吧！

最后，可以的话就为我投上一票吧，为我的呕心沥血之作先谢了，拿到大奖(出国参加任何一个加密货币活动或是折现5ETH）时一定办个社区回馈活动！
