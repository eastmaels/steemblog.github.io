The whole crypto market continue to crash under the bottom line setting the whoile marketcap below 110B which is thrilling for all the hodlers to see, I'm definitely one of them. After my curse on Factom yesterday by mentioning them in the <a href="https://steemit.com/crypto/@fr3eze/factomisswimmingagainstthewaterfall-zfzu7xiqb4">post</a>, the coin has finally corrected and follows the downward trend all together.

EOS has clearly became the biggest loser of the day losing about 20% and sitting at $1.74 at the time of writing. Again, no particular bad news for the project that I could find on the community but as a <em>casual</em> player at Betdice there is some interesting phenomena going on.

<h3>People are gambling way harder than before in the huge bear market.</h3>

Take a look at the Dapp Radar for EOS, all the famous gambling dapps were surging in the betting volume with at least 20% to 80%. Betdice was one of them and those who skating DICE token is having a great time now. DICE/EOS is now trading at all-time-high 0.003400 EOS.

But why?

The most obvious reason to me was that the price of EOS has dropped so much that the gamblers feels like the coin is now much more <em>disposable</em> than ever. These gambling dapps were having great daily volume when EOS was at $5, I'm certain that would be more relaxing and easier for gambler to bet crazier with the same token which has just lost more than half of its value.

If my local fiat's value crash that hard tomorrow, maybe I won't mind to use the paper cash to wipe my arse while the toilet paper is running out. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/eos-crashed-hard-and-celebrated-by-eos-gamblers/ </em><hr/></center>
