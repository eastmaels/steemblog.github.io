</a>

<h2>How does it benefits the Steem ecosystem?</h2>

Let's cut it short and discuss what will the participants get for this event as it would require only 1 minutes of work.

<ul>
<li>First of all, you get to <strong>win upvotes upto $1</strong> once pasting that voting confirmation screenshot in under the <a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@oracle-d/vote-for-steem-to-get-a-free-listing-on-netcoins-and-win-oracle-d-upvotes-contest-8dbe4475bb65cest">original post</a> no matter what the outcome of the nomination contest.</li>
<li>If Steem got listed on the Netcoins platform, it means more explosure to <em>171,000 retail locations in over 53 countries across 6 continents</em>.</li>
<li>More attention to the Steem brings more trade volume, thus <strong>higher price of Steem</strong> could be expectted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use disposable temporary email service for the voting purpose like <a href="https://temp-mail.org/en/">Tempmail</a></li>
<li>Voting can be done multiple times every 24 hours.</li>
<li>Use free VPN like <a href="https://www.tunnelbear.com/">Tunnelbear</a> to bypass the voting limitation.</li>
<li>Disposable email + VPN = <strong>Unlimited voting</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Let's cast the vote now</h2>

At the time of writing, the top coin in the nomination list is having 1200 votes while Steem ranks at 5th position with 528 votes. C'mon, this is no really competition if half of the 50k active Steemian has done their part!

Just like the <em>Byteball Airdrops to Steem holders</em> event, this voting contest is <strong>the next no-brainer event to take part for all of us here</strong>. Spend a minute to vote, win a big juicy upvote, and help us all in the community, will you?<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/lets-do-steem-community-a-favor-and-get-a-1-worth-vote/</em><hr/></center>
