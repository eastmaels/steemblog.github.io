## What is MoxyOne?

![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmXrW7FXQMUp8THb5No5vLzR6nKLtTGuTU6WDxtejciWtS)

MoxyOne aims to provide a seamless infrastructure for cryptocurrency company/team to allow their user in order to spend tokens. 

**For new ICO or existing crypto company** that are widely spread over different niches other than payment system, they will have to invest extra resources and effort to develop in-house payment channel for the end-user to utilize their tokens. By white labelling MoxyOne wallet system, the partner company can now skip all the unnecessary cost to offer debit cards to the public.

**For end-users** like us,  we can now convert our cryptocurrency to fiat instantly no matter it is making a purchase at a shop or even withdraw fiat from an ATM.

## What about MoxyOne vs its competitors?

We know Monaco and TenX are the biggest players in the field but there is something exclusively offered by MoxyOne. That is the ability to whitelist ICOs or existing crypto teams to allow their users spending the tokens in real life.

Furthermore, with MoxyOne JITF(Just-In-Time Funding) protocol, users don't have to reload the card with crypto like the competitor's prepaid card model. This not only would avoid unnecessary losses if the card went missing, but the overall payment process is seamlessly smooth.

## What is MoxyAI?

MoxyAI is another killer feature that helps users to spend their tokens with best-value at the time of sale. 

Let's say user have BTC and ETH in the cards and would like to buy a cup of coffee while BCH goes down 10% and ETH spike to 15% at that point of time, MoxyAI will suggest to using ETH for the payment instead of the default currency BTC.

MoxyAI will always choose the best performing tokens for best possible value in a transaction. Buy low sell high remember?

## What is the token for MoxyOne?

SPEND is the token that will mainly responsible for individual transactions and transactions fee. It was not designed for buy and hold but SPEND is meant to fuel the whole MoxyOne payment system. As all transactions will incur negligible fees in term of SPEND, this healthy circulation of SPEND tokens will become a valuable asset and we can the value to grow over time.

## How will the SPEND value grows?

As every transaction using the MoxyOne system are required to pay a negligible fee in SPEND including:
- Liquid provider need to acquire 100,000 SPEND to partner with MoxyOne
- User needs to get some SPEND for transaction fee.
- ICO or exchanges partners need to acquire minimum amount of SPEND for partnership.

Demand over SPEND as the fule of MoxyOne will only go up over time as the project expands.

Crypto companies like [Sociall](https://sociall.io/), [Gladius](https://gladius.io/), [eBitcoin](https://www.ebitcoin.org/), [FLUX](https://flux.fund/en), [Invox Finance](https://www.invoxfinance.io/), and zero-fee exchange [Cobinhood](https://cobinhood.com/) has already be MoxyOne partners, and the list is growing.

Amazing marketing effort for a project that is still in the ICO phase I would say!
