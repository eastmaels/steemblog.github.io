After a few weeks of learning web development, whenever I wanted to add some new features on the website, the first thing I do is to Google whether such features are already available as an extension or plugin. Most of the time, the result is positive so I can save up tons of time custom engineering one up myself.

This time, I wanted to add an information icon which will pop up a tooltip over a mouse hovering. <a href="https://popper.js.org/">Poppers.js</a> and <a href="https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/">Tippy.js</a> appears to be really famous projects to choose from. They have an amaizng introduction page and the overall programs are really easy to apply. Plus, they are actively maintained thus I expect least bugs and issues.

Development nowadays is all about not to reinventing the wheels. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/awesome-tooltip-library/ </em><hr/></center>
