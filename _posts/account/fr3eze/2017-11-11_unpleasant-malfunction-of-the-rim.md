It's been our routine to play at this court once in a week right after work. We were the first batch of users at the court completion day which was three years ago, everything else is fine but the rims are aging badly. It would bounce up and stuck at the up right position. 

We were mid way in a game and have to end the game after trying hard to fix the rim but to no avail. A batch of teens is working on it after us.

这篮球场在公司附近建成以来已经快三年，我们也是第一批用户。如今每个星期工作后必定来打一晚上。球场一切都还好，只是篮筐的状态每况愈下。一次激烈的弹动就会让它卡在上方的尴尬位置。

这不得不让我们终止进行到一半的球赛，尝试解救无果后就放弃了。后来来了一班充满热情的小伙子也努力的在尝试，加油！
