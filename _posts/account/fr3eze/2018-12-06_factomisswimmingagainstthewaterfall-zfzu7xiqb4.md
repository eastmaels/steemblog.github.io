Take a look at the recent 1-month graph of Factom, what can you observe? Yes, it is complete the upside down version of the whole crypto market or any random crypto!

A couple of random coins could disobey the overall market trend either up or down. But I rarely seen something <em>rebellious</em> like this, Factom has been rocketing despite its peers were swimming in a straight down waterfall.

Searched through the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/factom/">Factom Subreddit</a>, I don't find any significant news that is sufficient to explain this weird bull behaviour and the only interesting thing I could find is the GIF below that pretty much sums up what Factom is all about recently.

Trading market is never a reasonable place, especially the crazyass crypto. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/factom-is-swimming-against-the-waterfall/ </em><hr/></center>
