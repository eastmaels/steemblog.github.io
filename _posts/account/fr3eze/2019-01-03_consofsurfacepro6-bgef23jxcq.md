This is could generally apply to the other model of Surface Pro since the series has been using the same design and most of the complaints are related to the design and hardware.

<ul>
<li>The famous fabric type cover is very comfortable and great for the stylish hipster look, but too bad it is made of fabric. <strong>It gets dirty easily when the usual metal material laptop base</strong>. I find myself starting to wipe clean the public tables every time before putting my Surface on it. The fear of contaminating the crispy clean type cover was growing to the extent that I feel like <strong>I’m serving the device more than it is serving me</strong>. And this is totally against my principle.</p></li>
<li><p>While it has a generally good mouse pad, <strong>the clicking is rather not comfortable</strong>. The clicking is tough and requires more force to press down to register a click. The clicking sound is <strong>loud</strong> as well.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Thunderbolt 3 port</strong>. I’ve no idea what the Surface Pro team was thinking that they decided to exclude this industry standard in the year 2019. It was such a deal breaker for me and I wouldn’t buy it if weren’t for the huge discount on Black Friday sales. Wake up, Microsoft.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Due to the lacking of TB3 ports, Microsoft has to make their independent charger brick. Although it is much smaller and portable than the traditional 1KG charger, user still has to bring the whole charger since the <strong>the charging cable is unique and undetachable from the charger brick</strong>.</li>
</ul>

One last complaint and this is more a personal thing, I intended to use the Surface Pro as a laptop mainly, which wasted the “table” side of this 2-in-1 tablet device and I think is another form of wasted resource as well.

Overall, Surface Pro is still a solid device and a leader in 2-in-1 tablet. Make sure you will make full use of both the laptop and tablet side of this machine and I think that would be a great investment to make for anyone.
