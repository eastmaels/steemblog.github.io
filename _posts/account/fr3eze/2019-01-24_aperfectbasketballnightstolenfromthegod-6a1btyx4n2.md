Despite the damaged but still playable rims, the basketball court looks fantastic especially under the morning bright sun. Such an inviting-to-play scene when I passed by it on the way to the office. We are going to have a great ball night tonight, I thought.

530pm, the sky went dark all of a sudden and 5 minutes before that the evening sun was still roasting the world. Typical Singapore weather, unpredictable as usual. It started drizzling, and fortunately, it was just a short and weak drizzling.

We were still able to carry on the basketball night perfectly, it was like a perfect night was stolen from the god of weather, nothing feels better this way. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/a-perfect-basketball-night-stolen-from-the-god/ </em><hr/></center>
