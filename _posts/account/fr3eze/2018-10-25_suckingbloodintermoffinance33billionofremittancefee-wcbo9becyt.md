Someone tweeted about some crypto shilling:

<blockquote>
  The World Bank estimates that 7.57% of each remittance transaction goes toward transfer fees. This means that the fee levied on remittance going to the developing world will likely amount to <strong>more than $33 billion in 2017.</strong>

</blockquote>

To have a more vivid idea of how much does $33B worth in term of crypto:

<ul>
<li>Total marketcap for crypto is $209B now and the all-time-high was about $800B. $33B is close to 15% of all the crypto combined.</li>
<li>It is 60% more than what Ethereum worth($21B)</li>
<li>It is 83% more than what Ripple worth($18B)</li>
<li>It is <strong>164 times bigger than what Steem worth($200M)</strong></li>
</ul>

The fee alone could make 164 more project that worth the same as Steem while the project like those could largely aim to eliminate the traditional bank fee. Mind-blowing.

These blood-sucking fee are mainly the feeder to bank and banker and somehow I can relate their dislike towards the crypto. Whales already are sending multimillion worth of coins globally with a few cents of fee, if not free at all. Stop whining on your red crypto investment portfolio and think about that for a second.

Blockchain is ground-breaking, and I'm certain banks are on the ground.<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/sucking-blood-in-term-of-finance-33-billion-of-remittance-fee/</em><hr/></center>
