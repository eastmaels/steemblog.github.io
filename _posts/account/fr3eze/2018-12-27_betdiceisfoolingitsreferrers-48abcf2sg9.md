Betdice players might want to take note of this.

The game is reducing the referral bonus to its referrers by bringing changes to the revamped site. Previously, all you need is to provide a referral link like <a href="https://betdice.one/?ref=gamblingdivs">https://betdice.one/?ref=gamblingdivs</a> and anyone who play the dice game on that URL will get earn the user <code>gamblingdivs</code> some referral bonus. And that link used to redirect the browser right to the dice game page, it is a different flow now.

<center>The referral link will now lead to a brand new <em>landing page</em> instead of the dice game itself. User proceeds to click on the obvious Dice tab for a gaming session.</center>

<center>User was redirected to the actual game page and you can notice that the URL has been converted to <code>https://betdice.one/dice</code> <em>unknowingly</em></center>

In other words, you could just introduce someone new to the game via referral link and hopefully earn some bonus by bringing Betdice a new stream of profit. Betdice kindly accepted your kindness and gave you zero cent out of the new profit.

This is not cool at all, Betdice. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/betdice-is-fooling-its-referrers/ </em><hr/></center>
