As a resident in Singapore and crypto enthusiast, sometimes I'm glad to have a nice fiat-to-crypto exchange like <a href="https://accounts.liquid.com/sign-up?affiliate=4o4a1Wgk33226">Liquid</a>. Previously known as the Quoinex and now rebranded to Liquid, the Japanese exchange platform is providing a consistent high-quality work to all the users.

<h2>Wide range of fiat/crypto pair</h2>

The home currency SGD is paired with famous coins like Bitcoin(of course), ETH, NEO, Dash, to minor coins like RKT, UBTC, and QASH. I'd normally go with the ETH and BCH for the high volume, low transaction fee and fast speed.

Overall the volume in the exchange is awesome so there is no worry for a big unpractical spread in the trading book.

<h2>Zero trading fee for all crypto/fiat pairs!</h2>

This is the single most amazing point that attracts me the most while I was an active trader back then. Could not find another exchange that is on par with Liquid while waiving off the trading fee. Although it is limited to crypto/fiat pair only, this is awesome enough for me as I now mainly use the platform as entry and exit point for some real cash.

I'm a simple man, I see feeless system I cheer for it!

<h2>Security is a dual-edge sword</h2>

Purely judging from the user perspective, Liquid might be the most secured exchange I've been using due to its tedious deposit and withdrawal process which is possibly still handled by human. I observed this as my requests only processed in the working day but not the weekend. Maybe the platform chose this approach to enhance the security but undeniably it is not as competitive with automated exchanged like Binance.

Nonetheless, <strong>Liquid still easily the best exchange for crypto/fiat pair trading if you resides in SG or Japan</strong>.
