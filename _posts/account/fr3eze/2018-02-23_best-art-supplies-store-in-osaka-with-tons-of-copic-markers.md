Japan is very well known for its art culture with tons of anime and manga. While my girlfriend is ready to sweep the cosmetic shops really bad, I was hoping to visit some art supplies store to enrich my art creating supplies. 

With some Googling, I found a truly awesome art store in Osaka, the **U-ARTS**.

<center><sub>Storefront of U-ARTS. Nothing fancy but looks very practical for what I need a art store to look like.</sub></center>

<center><sub> On the first floor you can find all kind of art materials and tools. This is a section of pencils and charcoals, but not limited to what has shown in the picture. </sub></center>

<center><sub>Finally, this is what I was searching for in the store. Copic markers! They are slightly more expensive than what I've seen in the other small art store though. However, the store carries the whole color scheme of Copic. To make things more awesome, they even have the refillable ink for all 300+ of Copic markers!</sub></center>

<center><sub>Oil, acrylics, watercolors, you name it, they have it. Including all kind of  'accessories' like gesso and primer, and a lot more other stuff that I do not know what they are used for.</sub></center>

<center><sub>The second floor is all about fundamental to splash the creativity upon. Papers, primed canvas, and you can some art mounting or framing service here as well.</sub></center>

### Summary

The only drawback of U-ARTS is their pricing which is slightly more expensive than others. For someone who stays longer in Japan, try to opt for Amazon Japan for similar products for a lower price.

However, their strength is the easily the completeness and wide variety of product lines that available in one-stop. You will be able to try out all the markers, pencils and tools on the racks. One huge bonus for the travelers, their products are all **tax-free**! Nice point to have to offset the above-average pricing.

So if you are in Osaka and eager to find some art supplies, you can't miss U-ARTS!

**U-ARTS** 是我在大阪难得逛到的美术用品店。缺点是价格比同行稍微贵点，但它的强大优势绝对可以弥补这个缺点。~~虽然还是有点肉疼。~~这间店的规模虽然不会太大，但是所装备的货物绝对齐全，从铅笔油彩马克笔，到手工模型道具，一应俱全。最重要的是还有我最爱的 Copic 马克笔！还要是全套颜色一各都不缺。当然我还没到全部买下的程度，那可是需要近 1700 新币的代价！

对旅游者而言这里还有个很大的好处，就是他们提供免税服务，这样本来高昂的价格带来的伤害就可以减轻些啦。

要是你在大阪又想找些艺术用品，必不可以错过这里。
