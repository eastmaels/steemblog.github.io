This is probably the top efficiency I've seen in a long time by STINC to deliver their <em>promise</em>. They <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@steemitblog/testing-ads-on-steemit-com">mentioned</a> that the idea of advertisement placement on the Steemit fronted could be tested in order to seek for a new source of income <strong>two days ago</strong>, and it was implemented today if not earlier. That's another level of efficiency if you compared to the development of SMT which was supposed to be delivered last year.

At least the good thing here is, <strong>I know that STINC is still functioning.</strong>

Thanks to the handy uBlock Origin ad blocking tool on most of my main browsers like Chrome and Firefox, I did not realize the advertisement implementation on Steemit just yet. I have to move to the naked Edge to make see how the ad looks like, this is probably the first and only time that <strong>I actively looking for an advertisement.</strong>

The advertisement placement is very minimal, I can only see one or two in the Hot or Trending page. Of course, this could be adjusted all the time, but so far they are not disturbing the reading experience on the platform. Steemit might want to make the advertisement more 'blend-in' with same photo size, heading and description as the other listing of the posts.

Let's hope this is the change for good. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/advertisement-on-steemit-is-real/ </em><hr/></center>
