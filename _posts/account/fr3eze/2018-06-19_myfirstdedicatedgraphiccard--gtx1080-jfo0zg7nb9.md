<p>My desktop rig is finally comes to its perfection after acquiring the final puzzle piece, the GPU -- <strong>EVGA GTX 1080 Superclocked.</strong></p>

<p>The rig was build one year ago aim to be a powerful performance work and play station for productive and entertainment purpose. Due to the spiked demand for GPU fpr mining, the price was jacked up so high that a value-based consumer like myself could not afford to accept. </p>

<p>Although the mining frenzy is much chilled than before and the price of GPU seems to drop back to normal level. It is still not really a good timing to get one considering the GTX 10 Series is almost a 2-year old product. I bought it for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Despite for the productive/gaming usage, I could use it to mine some new coins during idle time which the timing could be crucial. The earlier you start mining the mlre coins you can get for those new POW coins with ultra low difficulty.</li>

<li>I have growing needs for a powerful GPU.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is some of the unboxing process for my new and expensive toy:</p>

<p><center>The cards qas book via Amazon Prime Now in SG. This is my first order and they really able to ship within 2 hours and this alone would outperform all the competitors here in SG as they normally take days to deliver. The price was <strong>755 SGD</strong> which is much lower than current market price.</center></p>

<p><center>Wow, finally get to hold my own dedicated GPU after all these year as a PC lover. It was unrealistic and unaffordable for me for a long while til this moment.</center></p>

<p><center>I was expecting a very bulky packahing but it seems like the manufacturers has slimed down a lot on the packing while not sacrificing the protection quality. This simple plastic case is sufficient in handling mild violent situation.</center></p>

<p><center>A handsome and solid card. This is a GTX 1080 chip with two open structure fans and ball bearing which is an important mechanism in ensuring a long life operation. The mechanical design looks so sexy with all the detail parts.</center></p>

<p><center>The view of backplate. Not every GPU comes with one but the EVGA 1080 SC is here with a sexy one. The cold and solid feeling of the aluminum backplate feel liks almost a guarantee of great cooling ability to me.</center></p>

<p><center>Plug it in on the motherboard, the design blend in quite well with my low profile and non-flashy rig. No RGB and fancy lighting, just consistent extra juice from this lovely eanormous card whihc took up 2 PCIE slot and 12-pin power connector.</center></p>

<hr />

<p>Absolutely feeling lovey knowing I have a rig able to handle whatever whatever task I throw at it. Video editing, mining, gaming, and more to explore! What do you think about this GPU?</p>

<p>忍了一年，终于在上个礼拜忍不住出手买了独立显卡，也就是 <strong>EVGA GTX 1080 Superclocked</strong>。会在这个实在不算好的时机入手，除了对显卡的需求越来越高，另一个原因就是可以在空闲时候挖一挖矿。所挖的矿都是最新的币，所以越早挖成本越低，以后爆发的话收益越高。还有另外一个原因就是日益稳定的价格，这张卡花了 755 新币，比市场价低廉很多了。</p>

<p>作为电脑爱好者二十多年，这次终于第一次拥有了自己的独立显卡，还要是顶端的 GTX 10 系列，实在是有点激动不已。以后什么吃鸡挖矿剪辑4K视频，统统放马过来！</p>
