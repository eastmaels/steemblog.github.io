Hate to say this but Reddit has become part of my *Googling* experience that if I wanted to ask for genuine opinion and solution which is not originated from some paid article, I look it up in Reddit. They just have the most diversified topics and tremendous user base for a content site, I truly hope Steem could catch up to that.

I have passed the age that looking for cracked or pirated version of everything. I learn to respect intellectual property after being a sort of a *content creator* myself on Steem. Not funny if I found out someone has put my content into commercial use without permission. 

More importantly, the idea of endangering my PC in the exchange of saving some bucks is simply silly. We practically running our own bank for an investment in cryptocurrency. You don't hire a scammer to work in your bank because you can pay minimal to zero wages to them.

# Piracy is sometimes inevitable

I started all these because I have had enough of using the subpar Gimp that I want the more user-friendly Photoshop. I have no idea what is the exact official price but it should be around $700. I mean PS is definitely the industry standard but paying a whooping $700 for hobby usage? I'm not that crazy.

I lookup the [/r/Piracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/) for some workaround and found out the excellent [tool page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/tools). Basically, the idea is to download PS software from official Adobe cloud as trial edition, then patch the authentic-checking program using one of the tools. What a best way to acquire cleanest possible version of PS.

## This is just for educational purpose

This post is not encouraging you to start to be a pirate. If you are living off graphic design jobs but cannot afford to pay the hefty charge yet. The best way is to pirate it first, earn some money by doing jobs, and buy the official software when you can afford it. This is how piracy can do the users a big favor. 

Supporting the authentic product can only benefit everyone in the long run. Developers get paid for continuously improving the product and users will be integrated seamlessly into the ecosystem with full support and possess less risk of piracy.

今日有点受够了作为 PS 的最佳替代者 Gimp 的种种不方便之处，想入手正版 PS 却又远远不值得，毕竟只是爱好用途。这时候盗版就派上用场了，长话短说，去万能的 Reddit 看看就能发现最佳的盗版方法，点[我](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/)。

简单来说就是从官方管道下载正版的 PS 试用版，然后用小软件破解检查版权的程序。这是最好最干净的方法了，因为下载别人破解好的软件你永远不会知道里面还加上了什么别的东东。

长远而言，要是你想靠着 PS 吃艺术创作这行饭，还是乖乖出钱投资正版软件吧。如果现在买不起，最好的方法就是先用破解版工作，等负担得起了再买，很多人都是这么做，这也是正确使用破解软件的最佳姿势。除了尊重版权作者，更重要的是正版软件更让人省心不少。
