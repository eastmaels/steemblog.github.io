The fun thing about crypto is, especially for those who claim themselves as a Holder(like myself), no matter how firm and tough they think will hodl and buy low in the big bearish market, the market will keep challenging them with new downturns.

Steem for the first has been crashed lower than my initial entry point which was around $0.9 ~ $1.0 one year ago. I thought I will never see the same price again when we were on our way to the moon last Dec. But yeah, I guess crashing 90% of the holdings one of the paths that everyone must go through. Regretted not so sell some to keep the profit while everything is raging, regretted throwing BTC for some random shitcoin ICO.

<h2>But Steem is an exception</h2>

I still have no idea why this awesome project doesn't get much traction at the price while it's community and activity on the chain would probably be greater than all the higher ranks coins combined.

It came out as a social media platform but has transformed into something which is bigger than that. You can do tons of things without blogging and posting comments at all and experience the advantages of the tech.

Feeless, 3s transaction, and the freaking part are, the community is developing new Dapps on the network like they are working for the Steemit.inc but they are not. Some are doing it for personal profit, some are purely for the welfare of the ecosystem. This speciality alone is making Steem so much more superior to many other competitors and it is one of the biggest reasons I still have much faith in it.

Is the ultra-bearish market change how you view the Steem?

加密货币真的是个很有趣的东西，当你自称 Hodler 无论如何不会放手时，就会不断地用新低来挑战你的底线。就譬如我们亲爱的 Steem，已经突破了我一年前进场时的 $0.9，往着零的方向义无反顾地掉落。但是，尽管充满了各种高位不知知进退放手获利的遗憾，和胡乱投资不知所云的 ICO 的后悔，Steem 依然是我最钟爱的最有信心的货币之一，尽管在如此低迷的市场。各种优势就不必再赘述了，无手续费，3秒出块，更绝的是还有一大块自觉热心的社区不断地为平台创造工具和应用，为公为私都有，简直是目不暇给，这也是其他同类项目所比不上的。

如此低迷的熊市有没有颠覆你当初对 Steem 的看法呢？
