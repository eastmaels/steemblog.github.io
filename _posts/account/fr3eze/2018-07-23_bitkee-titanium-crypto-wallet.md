## Hunter's comment
Paper wallet is great for keeping all the hungry evil hackers from your precious cryptocurrency recovery seeds. But Bitkee is *paper-wallet with steroids* because it:

- **does not afraid of extreme heat (up to 1650Â°C)**
- **does not vanish in the corrosive acid**
- **does not rust or stain easily**

Although the customization page only allows coins listed above, I guess you can just submit any seeds for them to engrave on the Bitkee. There are 3 types of wallet to choose from, the calssic card type, the keychain and even the dogtag!

What? So your all your coins will be stolen if the Bitkee guys go evil? You need to learn more about [BIP38](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0038.mediawiki) where the private keys is protected by your customized passphrase. Make sure you make a [strong password](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Storing_bitcoins#Password_Strength) so the bruteforce attack is practically impossible!
