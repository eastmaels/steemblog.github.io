It's been a while since the last time I took a look at the Cindicator Bot which will provide an AI-processed indicator of the crypto market. Despite I rarely trading crypto these days, the other main reason is that the Bot rarely provided positive strong indicator usually.

Last night before I decided to spend my last hour of the day playing GTA5, Cindicator Bot notified a great indicator for a famous coin, the <strong>Basic Attention Token(BAT)</strong> as follows:

It suggested a quick 11% gain from the price 0.00004629 BTC to 0.00005161 BTC within 10 days. Just, as usual, I take the fun experimenting over such a positive indicator with little money(just a few hundred bucks). Bought in at a little higher entry point(0.0000480-ish) as I did not get notified instantly.

<h2>Did not hit the target yet but we are close</h2>

Here is how the BAT do over almost 24 hours since my bought in time. All day high at 0.0000506 BTC and dipped a little bit to 0.00005011 BTC at the time of this writing. Nice and quick 5%+ profit within a day but our target is not hit yet although it was pretty quick. I've already set a sell order at 0.000052 BTC the moment I bought the BAT and I'm not going to change that.

Keep it going BAT, you can do better!

## <center>UPDATE: BAT went on a rally the very next day, yay! Check it out [here](https://steemit.com/bat/@fr3eze/bigrallydayforbatwhiletheothersaresinking-brzr2hh0hb) </center>
