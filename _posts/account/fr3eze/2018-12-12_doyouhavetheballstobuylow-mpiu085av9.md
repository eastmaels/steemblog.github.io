I tried to recall how my mind was acting back in the days that any shitcoins were surging in 2017. The confidence level was so high that if I ever come to the "buy low sell high" trading statement I would ask myself that "what if my favourite crypto falls to all-time low?", the answer would be 10/10 "definitely buy more!* every time.

And the market started to test my mental in 2018, when Bitcoin was down to 10k USD, like everyone else I thought this was a great chance and I <em>dollar averaged</em> some. The price keeps falling instead of going to the top 20k USD level, I kept buying except with a decreasing fund. Obviously, it reflects the decline of my confidence level with the bear market movement.

We are here a few months later, and crypto is getting nearer to the dirt every day. I haven't spent a dime in crypto buying for this whole period. Had some tight financial situation in real life being the top reason and like everyone else again, I was hoping the price to be lower.

Here is a dose for those were in the same place as me but would like to pick up the strong faith again and <strong>buy low</strong>:
