Being a complete newbie designer very soon I was ran into the famous browser incompatibility issue. There are so many different vendors of browser and each of them read the CSS differently.

<pre><code>  -webkit-transition: background-color 200ms ease, font-size 200ms ease;
  -o-transition: background-color 200ms ease, font-size 200ms ease;
  transition: background-color 200ms ease, font-size 200ms ease;
//these 3 line are reffering the same effect
</code></pre>

<a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</a> is a saviour to this issue. I wasn't using any CSS preprocesor in the project yet like LESS and SCSS, they might help to resolve this issue beforehand. If you were using plain CSS file like me and asking for least trouble of browser compatibility issue, this <a href="https://autoprefixer.github.io/">handy tool</a> based on autoprefix will helps a lot. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/autoprefix-tries-to-make-your-website-looks-the-same-across-different-browsers/ </em><hr/></center>
