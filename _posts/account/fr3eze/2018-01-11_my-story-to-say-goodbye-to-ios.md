Starting from the Symbian OS from Nokia phone, the first smartphone was the LG Nexus 4. I had a really hard time choosing which Android phone I should go and my Android fanboy friend said that I should really give Nexus series phone a try. Running stock Android like how the should be running without bloatware, ultra smooth, incomparably lightweight. I said why not and that's how I first got my pure Android experience with the Nexus 4. 

Why didn't consider the Apple? Simple because my student pocket was too shallow for a luxury item like that. This applies to why I use Windows all my life without ever considering the Mac. 

Until I'm capable of having wider choices, always wanted to try the famous iOS product I got myself the iPad and iPhone. Top-notch build quality, stable and smooth UI experience, I was once feeling a sense of privilege everytime I use them. Until some problems clashed with my freedom-based mindset:

### File sharing with others is a nightmare.

No Bluetooth to non-iOS devices and iTunes is such mess that I suspect it was created just to anti-human. Simple task like sharing a photo with my Android peer the best way is to use third party solution like email or cloud-based service like Dropbox. When I connect the device to the Windows PC via iTunes wanted to backup or retrieve something, I scratched my head throughout the whole process every time. And every other time I attempt something with the iTunes, I will have to start like I was a total beginner as those steps are way too complicated to understand.

I understand Apple wants to force the fan to build Apple ecosystem in their environment. I guess having a full set of iCloud, iPhone, iPad, MacBook could make one's life really easy. But too bad I'm not a believer in such fanboy fantasy. 

File sharing is just a big pain in the arse for iOS.

### Rigid and inflexible system flow.

How to activate color invert in iOS and Android? In iOS, ` Settings > General > Accessibility>Invert Colors` 4 steps. While in Android, pull down the toggle panel from the top bar and press invert color, 2 steps. Or you can even set a shortcut on the homescreen where you can press right away. 

Maybe you say iOS can do the same using the pull-from-bottom control panel, but that feature is not available until Apple decided to offer it. At least those four steps are what I have to do when I want to have a nice night-reading time inside my bed. Oh yeah, the *Night mode* isn't available back then as well.

I wished so bad I can customise and tweak those little things to make my life better that I jailbroken both the iPad and iPhone. Only to find out it doesn't grant more freedom than the unrooted Android.

The last straw was when I found out the same music file in an App is not available in the other player App. That I have to download an identical song in every music playing App on my iPhone. I've decided this is not my thing and I've had enough. Live my life happily after going back to the open arms of Android and I never look back.

That's my firm belief that one should not reject a food without ever trying it. The only thing iPhone impressed me the most was the physical build quality. Stock Android running on an iPhone body could be the best phone in the world. 

Next, I shall talk more about Android.

简要：

穷苦的从前让我只能选择使用安卓，后来稍微有能力买得起苹果了就果断入手 iPhone 和 iPad 来拉高格调。果然如传说中的一般高上大，一流的硬件设计和过硬的 iOS 系统都让我每一次使用的时候心里的虚荣感不住骚动，知道麻木之后问题开始浮现：

### 文件分享简直是噩梦

遇到最笨的设计就是同一首歌曲居然只能在一款播放器里找得到，别的播放器听的话只能再次下载另一份一模一样的歌曲。那还得了？蓝牙分享只认自己人，还有人类的天敌 -- iTunes，这款软件根本就是设计出来让人得忧郁症的。每次一次使用即使是为了重复之前做过的动作，都会让人有种从来没用过的新手感觉。用的当儿真的想叫开发员出来，让拳头们好好的和他们交流交流。

### 死板的系统流程设计

*反转颜色*这个效果在 iOS 要四个步骤才可以完成，而在安卓只需要两个步骤，甚至可以在主页面设一个快捷键来一键开启功能。结果每天晚上在被窝里就是为了降低光线刺激好好上个网都要不厌其烦的重复繁琐的步骤。别小看那区区四步，对懒人来说那可是很痛苦的。后来为了得到我想要的自由就把设备们都越狱了，却发现得到的自由度还不如还没有 root 的安卓系统。

我主张没吃过的的食物就没资格去说不好吃。这次的经历让我笃定的回到了安卓的怀抱，从此过着幸福快乐的日子。下次再说说安卓吧！
