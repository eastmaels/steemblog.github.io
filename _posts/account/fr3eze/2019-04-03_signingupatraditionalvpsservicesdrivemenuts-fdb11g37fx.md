They said you have to get out of the things that you are so used to, to realise you were already living in the privilege. I've been a long time user of @privex (my first VPS) and thinking of trying something new by other brands. Not that Privex is not competitive but I just want to know and experience more about the VPS industry. Reading through some reviews to find out people usually recommending Hetzner Cloud, Linode, and Vultr. Out of my expectation, the signing up process gave me tons of shit.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud">Hetzner Cloud</a> offer an unbeatable price and hosted in Germany, requires me to upload my passport for verification. Too sick of KYC requirement like this.</p></li>
<li><p>Vultr while being my first choice due to their rather modern web UI and great reviews, just would not let my credit card pass and give no reasons for me to 'troubleshoot'.</p></li>
<li><p>Linode VPS was my last attempt and giving me least shit. Application is still undergoing verification, at least they didn't block me out of no obvious reasons. Hopefully this one get through soon.

</ul>

<p>The whole process made me missing everything when I was signing up with Privex. Damn. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/signing-up-a-traditional-vps-services-drive-me-nuts/ </em><hr/></center>
