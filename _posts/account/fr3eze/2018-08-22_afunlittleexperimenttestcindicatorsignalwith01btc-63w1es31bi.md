I've been a Cindicator's Beginner plan user for quite a long time, traded a few times according to the prediction it processed and the result is not disappointing. And then I lost interest in trading after a short while mainly due to the fact that I cannot make it consistently profitable(Yeah I'm a honest guy).

With a strong signal received few days ago, I was inspired that why not spare some fun and buy according to the prediction signal to test the accuracy in a  real way. The condition for the experiment are as follows:

<ul>
<li>Test against only with <strong>bullish indicator.</strong></li>
<li>The indicator <strong>must exceeds 80%</strong> which interpret a very high probability event.</li>
</ul>

<h2>First experiment = SUB/BTC trade above 0.0000209 BTC (+11%) in a week</h2>

<h3>The Indicator</h3>

<center>Substratum is a interesting project and I do not own any of it now. Would be great chance to test this signal.</center>

<h3>The mini fund</h3>

<center>I will spare <strong>0.1 BTC</strong>(I'm a Bitcoin plankton) to kick start for the experiment and use whatever total amount after gaining/losing in each experiment in future tests.</center>

<h3>The buying</h3>

<center>Bought the SUB at 0.00001908 which is already a little bit higher than the starting point(0.00001882) in the indicator. The buying is done after 1 day of indicator which is not a ideal situation and I shall try to act as soon as possible whenever I see a new eligible indicator. <strong>Bought 5227 SUB at the price 0.00001908 SUB/BTC</strong>.

<h3>The selling</h3>

Immediately after the buying I set up a sell order which a selling price a little bit higher than the price stated in the indicator as well just to cope with my delay in timing. <strong>Selling 5227 SUB at the price 0.00002105 SUB/BTC</strong>.

Let's see if I'm gonna score the 10% gain before 30th Aug!

用 0.1 BTC 来作为 Cindicator 市场预测的试金石。这次的信号是在八月三十号之前，0.00001882 SUB/BTC 有高达 86% 会达到 0.0000209 SUB/BTC。我进行操作的时候已经迟了一天所以在买卖上的价格也做了些调整，但应该不影响操作结果。究竟是否能如愿得到 10% 的获利呢？让我们拭目以待吧。
