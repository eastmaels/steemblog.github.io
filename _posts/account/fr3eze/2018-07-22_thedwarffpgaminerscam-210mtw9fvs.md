I've been paying close attention to the development of FPGA mining lately and the best source of such information of course still have to count on the old-school Bitcointalk forum.

Found a hot thread under the Altcoin mining subforum with the title <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3628532.0">Dwarf FPGA – the anti-ASIC</a>. In the first postthe author claimed that all the 5000 units of Dwarf FPGA miner is all out of pre-order, at the price of 300 Euro. Hmm, that is a total of 1.5 million Euro.

I wasn't sure if all the pre-order folks has paid the amount upfront but I hope they did not. Because the author/company just disappeared after the failing to meet the delivery promise on time. It turned out everything is a scam whereby no one has an idea who is really behind the whole thing. Someone must lost money as I saw some lawsuit comments flying here and there in the thread.

But what those scam victims is going to tell their lawyer, that they just handed over the cold real cash to someone anonymous and behind a Junior rank of forum account? Those FPGA miner are selling for least 3k thousands from legit miner makers, 300 Euro for one already sounds too damn good for a deal and I would call that a free lunch.

However, there's no free lunch in this world.

FPGA 挖矿再圈中越来越火红，但是由于制作的技术要求很高，需求和提供量远远失衡，造成了很多诈骗的发生。就在古老的 Bitcointalk 里的这个<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3628532.0">帖子</a>，可以看到一个完全匿名的新手用户如何通过兜售廉价的挖矿机而获利，总额应该有一百五十万欧元。实在是骗得不少。要知道这类矿机的价格可是在数千美金以上，骗子说他那款只卖 300 欧元就是为了让<em>人人有矿挖</em>，还那么多人上钩，实在是有点可笑。
