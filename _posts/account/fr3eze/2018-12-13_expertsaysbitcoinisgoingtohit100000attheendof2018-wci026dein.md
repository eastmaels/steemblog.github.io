This picture pretty much sums up what the famous pro-Bitcoin investors have to say about the price prediction at the end of 2018, which is now. The least daring prediction was $20,000 by Pantera Capital and that looks like a moon to us from the <em>dirt</em> viewpoint currently. If we were to achieve half other <em>carefully calculated</em> prediction even it was <em>just</em> for $20k price level, we could halve the world suicide rate. How ridiculous.

Are these famous people stupid and they are too bored to make some bold statement and risk their reputation? Maybe not. Likely they have their own skin in the game while making bullish promises like that will keep the BTC price well supported so they can keep selling off their holdings, or they were really speaking out from the strong faith? There are countless average investors making bullish prediction in the same tone while market starts to correct.

<strong>And we know how the thing is going now.</strong>

Established bullish investors might be embarrassed by their predictions now and average bullish joes like us are likely trying to forget all the stupid decision we have made in the bear market, probably wishing for a time machine to that they can go back in time and draw a clear line with the stupid Bitcoin.

Suddenly everyone is saying getting rid of Bitcoin is a wiser choice. Just like how everyone was hailing for it last year.

<strong>Act along or against the *mainstream* opinion?</strong> Your bet.
