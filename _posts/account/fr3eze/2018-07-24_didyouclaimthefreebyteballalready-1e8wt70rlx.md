<h2>Finall the Byteball referral hijacking was fixed</h2>

Glad to see the announcement <a href="https://steemit.com/byteball/@punqtured/referral-links-are-king">"Referral links are king!"</a>. It simply means a few things:

<ul>
<li>The referral link is the only parameter to define who is the referral for a new sign-up and attestation.</li>
<li><strong>No need to send Bytes for attestion anymore.</strong> So those hunters can stop pathetically spamming with their addresses hoping to earn 0.0006GB(worth $0.08)</li>
<li>No more bots sending fund around just to steal the rewards from others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The craziest airdrop I ever seen</h2>

There was around 3,000 Steem attestor when the Byteball network was downd not long after the launch of airdrop 2 weeks ago. Guess what is the number now?

I was shocked for such a spectacular growth rate. Steemians definitely were one of the most money-minded groups, and I'm proud of being one of them, LOL. The reasons for the frenzy are obvious though: Real and instant money for 5 min job, generous referral reward, and the very supportive crypto crowd(which is us).

<h2>So how to sign up?</h2>

Thanks for the new update, no fees is required for attestation anymore.

<ul>
<li>Download a Byteball wallet(referral link): https://steem-byteball.org/#RRY2EIQ72SZRYTXLYOXM6CVZ2W7WZJ4T</li>
<li>Perform attestation via Steem Attestation Bot withint the wallet:</li>
</ul>
