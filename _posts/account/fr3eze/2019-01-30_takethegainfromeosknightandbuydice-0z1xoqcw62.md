Right before I was <a href="https://steemit.com/crypto/@fr3eze/quiteosknightafter5months-upsu7khq6w">officially quitting the EOSKnight</a>, I invested the EOS that earned by selling material into the DICE token in BetDice, which gave me a <a href="https://steemit.com/betdice/@fr3eze/ilost50eosinbetdicebutendedupwith170eosintheaccount-qxetm9ynz4">nice return</a> in the days that I starting to bet in EOS dice game.

What I did just keep buying the DICE tokens and stake it up for the bonus distribution for any incoming bets. As you can see in the graph, DICE/EOS has been declining for the whole of January and I kept buying in without any doubt. After that wasn't a big sum of fund(around 70 EOS) and I already made my capital back in the EOSKnight as well as in the dice game. I could totally suck it up in case everything goes down to zero.

By the way, the DICE price went up 20% today and it was nice given that I just bought in some before the price spike. I'm not too excited about it though since this market is usually more volatile than the overall crypto market. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/take-the-gain-from-eosknight-and-buy-dice/ </em><hr/></center>
