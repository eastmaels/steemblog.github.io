The coming <a href="https://steemit.com/steemfest/@roelandp/save-the-date-steemfest-bangkok-thailand-6-7-8-9-10-november-2019-let-s-go">Steemfest4</a> has been announced and finally this time it will be hosted somewhere very nearby my living place, Thailand!

I always wanted to attend the previous Steemfest when during my first and second year here on Steem, but the expensive air ticket has been a really effective reason(or excuse) not to make it happen. It seems like this won';t be the case anymore this time. Ironically, while I still care about Steem very much and in fact I've never been so deep into Steem since I'm taking a big part in @epicdice, my enthusiasm for Steemfest is somehow diluted, strangely. However, since the air ticket cost is much more friendly, at least I will put myself in a neutral position now before making a decision.

At last, check this <a href="https://epicdice.io/?ref=fr3eze">epic game</a>(referral link) out and be the cool kid in town! <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/steemfest4-in-asia-at-last-go-or-not/ </em><hr/></center>
