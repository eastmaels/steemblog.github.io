<h2>Byteball network is up. Long way to go before running out of Airdrop reward pool.</h2>

Byteball network is finally up and normal again, I've just sent all the pending requests for the free Byteball in the last post: https://steemit.com/steempress/@vornix/bestcryptostorycontestwithatotal6sbdprize-a1wwiauon6
The network works smoothly as before and I did not encounter much issues now and I expect the same for the Steem Attestation Bot. If the bot is still stuck, leave your input there and give it some time, it shall return to you soon.

People are worried that the designated reward pool for this Airdrop will run dry soon but you can chill now. Yesterday the Byteball guy @punqtured just announced that there is <strong>326,989 GByte</strong> left to be claimed from all the Steemians.

That means $43,803,446 worth of Gbytes are still waiting to be distributed. <code>43,803,446/160=273771</code>, assuming all the unclaimed Steemians are all over 70 Reputation, <strong>it will take 27377 of them to fully deplete the Airdrop.</strong> So don't you worry. Take your time and perhaps give a little pump to your rep before attesting to the airdrop.

<h2>What is the reward?</h2>

The best thing this attestation is not depending on the SP at all but Reputation. Which means everyone including minnows will have fairer chance to claim reward as follow:

> Steem reputation above 30: you get a $10 reward
Steem reputation above 40: you get a $20 reward
Steem reputation above 50: you get a $40 reward
Steem reputation above 60: you get a $80 reward
Steem reputation above 70: you get a $160 reward

<h2>My free Bytes is strictly for NEW users only</h2>

I will continue to send free Byteball for the Steem Attestation as long as the users are proven to be <strong>truly new</strong>. With that said, I will check for the following:

<ul>
<li>The Byteball address provided should not have any balance.</li>
<li>User should not request Byteball from other Steemians before my send.</li>
</ul>

Violating any condition above I will take you as not a new Byteball user anymore, hence no fund from me to you. Also, this is to prevent Byteball-hunting as well.

<h2>How to get free Byteball?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Download a Byteball wallet(referral link): https://steem-byteball.org/#RRY2EIQ72SZRYTXLYOXM6CVZ2W7WZJ4T</li>
<li>Put your Byteball wallet address in the comment below</li>
<li>Receive 0.0006 GByte from me</li>
<li>Perform attestation via Steem Attestation Bot withint the wallet: https://steemit.com/steemit/@punqtured/official-byteball-airdrop-to-steemians</li>
<li>Done. Enjoy the free Byteball from airdrops!</li>
</ul>
