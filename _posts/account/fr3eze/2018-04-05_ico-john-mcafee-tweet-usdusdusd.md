It turns out [John McAfee is now charging $105,000 per tweet for promoting crypto projects](https://cointelegraph.com/news/john-mcafee-charges-105000-per-tweet-for-promoting-cryptocurrency-projects) after realizing his tweet could actually make a huge impact on any mentioned projects. 

Once McAfee tweeter was working like the Midas touch that whatever project promoted by him would gain a 100% gain over a short period. People even start making bots to track his tweet and automatically buy the tokens hoping the catch the *McAfee effect*. 

## How tweets are created
> ###### We turn down over 90% of all companies wanting to buy our services. The reason is that only products and services that Mr.McAfee truly believes in will be promoted. These are products or services that Mr.McAfee has personally purchased or used and is pleased enough with to engage in promotions, or ICOs whose white paper describes a vision in line with Mr.McAfee’s vision and the company producing it has passed our thorough audit. 
> ###### -- [McAfee Crypto Team](https://mcafeecryptoteam.com/effect.html)

Yeah, it means that project owners cannot secure a partnership with Mr.Midas Touch just because they can afford the 100k fee. Their projects have to be to genuinely valuable or at least believed by McAfee himself, which makes the tweet promotion sounds like a real solid recommendation.

## To follow McAfee tweet's promotion or not?

For short-term traders, maybe. This is just another pump-and-dump game where speed is the key. The early you get to react to the tweet and buy in before price being pumped, the higher the chance you are going to make money from it.

However for long term investor, this might not be the good idea. 

Although the McAfee team claims that they only promote projects that have a genuine value and turns down most of the offer they received, nobody can verify that claim but the team itself. Trusting a paid endorsement for an investment is like trusting the bank account will be the best place to store our money.

**DYOR(Do Your Own Research)** is the most important key here. Only putting the hard earn money on things that you know and comfortable to hold it through up and down over the period.

It is Okay to be notified by McAfee tweet about the optimism of a certain project. Be sure to read the whitepaper, join the community discussion, or even view the codes on Github, before pulling the trigger. Always do your due diligence.

John McAfee 这位高调异常的老头从防毒软件巨头成功的转型成加密货币专家。前一阵子他在 Tweeter 所推荐的货币项目无不在短时间内爆升，真的有点石成金之效。他也顺理成章的推出了 Tweeter 推荐服务，任何货币想要得到他的推荐，没问题，一个 Tweet 收费美一百千。实在全身都是生意头脑。

那应该跟随点金大师的推荐吗？

短线的话不妨玩一玩，但这就变成另一种 Pump and Dump 游戏，消息灵通的手快的就能赶在价格拉升之前入手，速度是关键。

但是长期投资来说就不一样了，对我来说相信一个付费广告而注入资金，无异于相信银行很我说储蓄户口就是金钱最佳的归宿。

**DYOR(Do Your Own Research)**是所有币圈投资者最该执行的原则。尽管点金大师的团队声明服务尽管收费，但他们只会推荐有前景和价值的项目，90% 的服务买家都会被拒绝。除了他们自己没人能证实这点。所以该做的功课还是要做的，当然钱太多就另当别论了。
