EOS gambling game was one of the hottest application on the network. Dapp like DEOS games, Betdice, EOS Poker, EOSBet, FarmEOS to the latest EOSJack, gambling application dominates the ranking under <a href="https://dappradar.com/eos-dapps?sortBy=volumeLastDay&amp;order=desc">DappRadar</a>

I spent some hours and EOS on some of those mentioned games and the conclusion is: <strong>EOS is probably the best cryptocurrency for decentralised gambling activity</strong>.

<ul>
<li>It is ultra fast, close to instant transaction speed makes the betting buttery smooth. Base on my experience, each bet just averagely needs only 1-2 seconds to be completed. That's insanely quick.</li>
<li>Just like Steem, EOS is running the freemium blockchain idea that all the <strong>trasacntion are feeless</strong>. This is another huge bonus point for a rapid-firing app like dice game.</li>
<li>EOS was the <em>most hyped</em> crypto compared to its peer thanks to the huge sum of money it collected over the 1-year long ICO.</li>
<li>The smart contract feature on EOS allows a truly transparent and fairer gambling experience than the traditional casino.</li>
</ul>

Personally, I have not yet experienced any huge and successful crypto use case in real life but I guess gambling could be the first one on my list. I also gained some huge advantage unknowingly over the period betting on the Betdice platform which I should share in the next post. Stay tuned. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/eos-best-use-case-gambling/ </em><hr/></center>
