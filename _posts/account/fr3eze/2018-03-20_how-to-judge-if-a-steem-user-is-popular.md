We are constantly judging each other in our life, aware of it or not. In the world of Steem, what is the first thing you look at when you visit someone's account? His reputation will tell us is he reputable, the SP in the wallet tell us is he a whale or minnow, the follower number will tell us if this guy is popular. 

Wait, can we really judge popularity merely by the number of followers? Take a look at these popular accounts and think twice: @byresteem, @hotlist, and @hottopic just to name a few. 

### Followers?
Do the 10k followers matter if 99.9% of them are dead account? You can too achieve this amazing army of fans by using a bot to follow 1000 plankton users every day and anyhow a few of them will follow you back. When you feel like accumulating enough of 'fan base', use a script to unfollow them all at once.

You must be so famous for having 23716 followers while just follow 15 people, aren't you?

### Post payout?
If you have 70 SBD, buying votes at 10 SBD each for consecutive 7 days post will average at least $20 payout per post. And that 70 SBD can loop almost forever. If you have 700 SBD to spare, we are talking about $200 average payout.

You are so well-known amongst the whales by making this kind of money!

### Amount of comment?
If only you take comments like "Great post my friend!" "Please vote me." "I like it. Please write more." into account, then yes.

### Votes of post?
You can get 1000 votes all you want but if they are all from plankton users with least or zero SP, our payout can be as good as $0.1. However there is another way to get huge votes through vote-selling platform like [Smartsteem](https://smartsteem.com?r=fr3eze), but vote-buying isn't the prove for a superstar.

### Reputation?
Again, the bigger votes you get the more you got promoted in the Rep. And there are bunches of vote-selling bots.

## So now you know how to promote post at the best value way

如何判断一个用户是否“火爆/有名/受欢迎”？每当在 Steem 遇到陌生人，你会在他们的户口上首先注意什么来判断此人的影响力？

关注群众？有 10,000 个浮游生物关注，还多数已经是离世多时的，有个X用。
帖子收入？准备$70，通过买赞每篇平均收入可达$20，无限循环哦。
留言数量？如果把灌水的 spam 留言都算留言，那好吧。
点赞总数？通过 [Smartsteem](https://smartsteem.com?r=fr3eze) 这样的平台要多少赞都可以。
户口名声？同理，买赞即可提供即战力，立马提高名声哦。

不懂你有没收到过来自@byresteem @hotlist @hottopic 的亲切问候，反正花 2 SBD 可以让帖子曝光在 22,000 的用户面前，这钱怎么算都值得花对吧！
