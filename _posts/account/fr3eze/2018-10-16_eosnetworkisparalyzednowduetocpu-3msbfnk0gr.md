As a new addict of the EOS betting games recently, EOS has become my second most participated network second to Steem. And the funny thing is after the controversial troublesome HF20 that Steem had gone through not long ago, EOS network is undergoing the same situation now.

<h2>Low-staked EOS user not able to do any transaction at all.</h2>

The <strong>CPU</strong> in EOS is kind of the same concept with the RC system in Steem as both are designed to minimize the abuse of transaction spamming. The more coins you staked for an account the more CPU/RC the account is capable of performing a transaction in the network.

<h2>Current CPU has gone to crazy high level</h2>

For example, my alternate account with 20 EOS staked for the CPU and at the level of 80% availability, <strong>was drained after one bet in the <a href="https://betdice.one/?ref=gamblingdivs">Betdice</a> game</strong>. That is almost 16 EOS worth of CPU for a single transaction. To bet 100 times continuously in a dice game, <strong>one needs 1600 EOS staked in the CPU.</strong>

Same as the trouble Steem's RC system brings to the users, only whales with tons of staked EOS could still enjoy the privilege of utilizing the network without limitation.

Some said it was due to some Block Producers is not performing well. If this is true, EOS is far more fragile than I expected as a few entities are sufficed to paralyze the <strong>biggest decentralized network</strong> this easy.

Come on, pull yourself together soon EOS!<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/eos-network-is-paralyzed-now-due-to-cpu/</em><hr/></center>
