I've heard much mysterious myth about how a mechanical keyboard can take your typing experience to another level. However, despite being a computer lover myself, I've spent most of my computing life on laptop thus found no need for another dedicated keyboard. Until lately I decided to upgrade from laptop to desktop PC.

I've spent plenty of time on researching every single piece of the rig component. Keyboard has been one of the most time-consuming part I've spent on. Following are the main factors to be considered when you are going for your first mechanical keyboard.

----------

### Keyboard size and layout
First, you have to decide which keyboard size and layout (from top to bottom in the picture):


- Full-layout/100% (with numpad and arrow/navigation keys)
- Tenkeyless/87% (no numpad, but with arrow/navigation keys)
- Compact/60% (no numpad or arrow/navigation keys)

Besides this three forms, there are some other form factors like **90%, 75%, 70%, or even 40%** (refer to picture below) which I personally think is pretty ridiculous. These are mainly meant for the niche market.

May be you can recall how often you will need to use the numpad, function key row, or navigation keys. For a gamer, the numpad is not important. For data entry job, one cannot live without the function key row and navigation keys. Depends on what you intent to do with the keyboard, a suitable size can not only save you some space on the desk but increase the aesthetic of your desktop.

### Mechanical switches

The next decision is which type of mechanical switch for the keyboard. Switches represent the soul for a mechanical keyboard and that spells the biggest difference from membrane keyboard. Under every key there is an individual switch responsible for single letter input, they often provide tactile feedback and audible "click-clack" sound during typing. 

#### Main characteristics of switches:

- **Tactile/Linear:** Tactile switches provide additional tactile feedback as the key actuates, imagine there is a bump in the middle of the switch when pressing down. Linear switches have a simpler operation, they moving up and down without additional tactile feedback.
- **Clicky/Non-clicky:** Clicky switches add a louder "click" sound along with the tactile bump allowing a more noticeable feedback.
- **Actuation force:** Heavier switches require more actuation force to bottom out a key which makes the switches feel stiffer.


If you hadn't owned any mechanical keyboard before, I'd suggest you to spend more time finding the best switch type that suits you the most. [Test switcher](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.2ed6e7976QeueS&id=43222870431&_u=q21m3vh01e2d) is the best thing that will let you get a feel for what each switch type feels like and how they sound. Also, they are not expensive.

Amongst variety brands on the market, Cherry MX switch is the most popular option in most places. We are not going to discuss rare switches like Topre, Gateron, ALPS, or any other switches as they are less common. 

#### Cherry MX Mechanical Key Switch comparison:

- **Cherry MX Blue:** Tactile and clicky. Loudest sound and distinct tactility provide most outstanding mechanical keyboard experience. Good for typing but caution to be used in shared working spaces.
- **Cherry MX Brown:** Tactile and non-clicky. Lighter version of Blue switch without the audible click. Good for the beginner.
- **Cherry MX Black:** Linear with high actuation force. Good for gaming with stronger typing force.

- **Cherry MX Red:** Linear with low actuation force. Good for gaming and typing while allowing rapid keystrokes.
