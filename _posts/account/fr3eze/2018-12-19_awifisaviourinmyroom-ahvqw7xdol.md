Finally received the saviour of my room's WiFi today from the Taobao double 11 festivals. Yes, it took a whole damn month for sea shipping all the way from China to Singapore. I almost forgot I did purchase this batch of items.

In my rented room, there is only one WiFi router for in the living room and I have no idea why the telco provided stock router sucks so much. It is just a thin wooden door between my room and the living room and we only get 50% of the WiFi's signal and speed. I did install a powerline adapter to serve a local LAN cable straight to my PC but all the other mobile devices are suffering big time from the weak WiFi.

So I decided to get a new router, and direct the local LAN cable from powerline adapter to it and cast WiFi while supporting the PC LAN connection at the same time.

This is the speedtest result using native WiFi provided by the router in the living room. I did several tests and this is the one with the highest speed.

And this is coming from the new router WiFI speedtest and I even took the lowest speed to show here. No description is needed anymore.

I'm glad that this workaround works and it never felt so good all my devices are feeling more alive now. WiFi is LIFE! <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/a-wifi-saviour-in-my-room/ </em><hr/></center>
