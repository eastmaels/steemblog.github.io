This is a site with a collection of incoming tokens Airdrop events:

https://www.eosdrops.io/

If you are not holding EOS for short-term, **it is strongly encouraged that to hold them at private wallet** to take advantage of the airdrop events. You will never know what those tokens will worth in the future so why not grab some when they are literally giving it for free?

However, in order to be eligible for the airdrop the ETH address that holds EOS tokens must be first registered with EOS network. Refer to post below if you are not sure you have done so already:

To verify if EOS keypair is valid:

Holding EOS in exchange is the better idea for greater convenience but I personally feel much better to hold coins in my own pocket. Furthermore, this is not even some rocket-science to do as guidances are everywhere online. Following both guides above and you are certainly good to go, your EOS is going to nowhere other than the moon(hopefully).

这个[网站](https://www.eosdrops.io/)可以一目了然的看到所有即将对 EOS 持有者空降糖果的项目，目前看来起码有六个。所以要不是短线投资的话，**最好就是把 EOS 放入自己的 ETH 地址.** 要知道交易所是不会把糖果派回给你的。

要注意的是所有 ETH 钱包要向 EOS注册过才会得到领糖果资格。以下两篇文章或许帮助得了你。
