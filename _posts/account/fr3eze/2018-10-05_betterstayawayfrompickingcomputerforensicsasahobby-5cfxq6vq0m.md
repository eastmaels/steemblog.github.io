As a computer security novice, I had so many myths about the Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator. Though the motive of attending this course is not purely improving my ability, the course name itself is attracting enough for any computer lovers.

Here are some facts that I learnt through the courses:

## Computer forensics is difficult, sometimes boring.

Because there is so any rules and regulation to comply with. Anything an investigator do must follow strictly with all the procedures and policies so that the finding result could be claimed valid in the court.

Opposing to the blackhat hacking which is ultra fun because there is no rules at all. The downside is only that always comes with legal responsibility.

## Computers forensics is not amateur friendly

A capable forensic investigator must have a very comprehensive set of toolkit in term of software and hardware in order to deal with all kind of computer assets.

Looking at the overwhelming variation of computer hardware alone, preparing cables ans connectors for harddisk storage would cost a fortune. For example of forensic software, Encase is the gold standard that would cost 20k USD for a single license.

## Computer forensics is all about teamwork

I really doubt if there is anyone who can handle every aspect of digital forensic at professional level. One must possess deep knowledge of computer science before capable of digging the ultra volatile digital evidence.

From OS and database, to mobile and malware forensic, each of them could simply form a independent discipline in forenaic field. Especially the malware would require investigator to have great fundamental of programming of multiple languages.
