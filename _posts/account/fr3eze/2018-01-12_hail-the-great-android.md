After my expression why Apple products is not my cup of tea, let's talk more about my favorite OS, the almighty Android.

Million thanks to the friend that introduced me my first pure Android device, the Nexus 4. Guess that was part of the reason I'm so into open-source idea in everything.

## Ultimate customization

![dd](https://static.pexels.com/photos/177707/pexels-photo-177707.jpeg)

It's cool for the manufacturer to guess my preference and design the system for me. Really convenient and thoughtful way to delivering a product. But they can't always be right in everything. That's why the room of customization is so important here. You are welcome to offer your best designed system to me and it would be great if I can tweak it a little more the way I like. In Android, you own your phone almost 100% top to bottom. 

Change that battery icon, show internet speed at top bar, decide multiple gesture effect on the screen, customize every single buttons on the phone and a lot more. Genuinely adapting a phone to the master himself. 

What? Who got the time to waste on stuffs like that? Well, iPhone design for people who don't value customization that much. In fact, swapping a wallpaper is considered a customization too.

## Lots of community support.

Amazing power of community project can already been witnessed from various aspects. For example,  innovative ideas could be realised through crowdfund ing platform like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, open-source project repositry site Github has been the best birth bed for cool freewares.

Android being one of the largest open-source projects and having probably the most active community, it is capable of generating countless ideas on the improvement and new features for for this mobile operating system.

The ability of gathering community intellegence and effort also bring much edgy functions like the split screen and off screen gesture to real application while no other OS capable of doing so.

Huge community= Rapid development, more support, great ideas, best execution.

至今仍然很感谢带我进入安卓世界的那位朋友，让我也发现原来自己是那么深爱具有开源特性的项目。继上次讨论过为什么不喜欢苹果的专制化之后，来吹一波安卓的伟大吧！

## 客制化就是唯一核心

大量的客制化选项是安卓最大的特色之一，从改变电池显示图形到每个物理按钮的实际作用，几乎没有一样东西是不能根据个人喜好而改变的。

当然这不是说用安卓就一定要费尽心思去改制一切，原生出产的设置也可以是很棒的，完全不用改变一草一木也可很好的使用。**只是在绝佳的原厂设置之下，再容许用户加上个人调整，最适合自己的绝佳手机不就诞生了吗？**

## 强大的社区

任何开源项目背后都有社区团队在支撑，而安卓身为可能是全球最受欢迎最多人参与的开源项目之一，所产生的力量更是不容小觑的。

安卓通过把集思广益最大化的效应实现了一个又一个站在业界前端技术，从早期的黑屏手势功能到后期的同屏双视窗，具有开创性的点子更是不断的被同行们所借鉴。

强大的社区意味着更高频率的开发，更多技术支持，更完善的执行能力。

当然还有很多场外因素巩固我对安卓的支持，比如众多的竞争产生出来的亲民价格。愿这么棒的操作系统继续蓬勃发展下去！
