I've got a friend who is really *religious* to an MLM(Multi level Marketing) company. He just finished a 22 months Work-and-Travel plan from Australia back to Malaysia. He has been working on the same MLM scheme for 10 plus years after high school graduation. Our peers always have a hard time understanding how he could still be that enthusiastic about his MLM career, despite achieving nothing prominent at all.

So he wrote a long message(essay) and Whatsapp to each of our friends explaining his enthusiasm and maybe hoping to attract us to join his MLM dream. I've summarized a couple of important points our of this long-ass post for you:

## 1.
> I'm going through something that you never experienced before, the passive income. Credit to my company, based on the past contribution they are sending me my monthly payout of RM600($170) for last 22 months when I wasn't working for them at all.

First of all, I'm experiencing some of the best passive income in the world now where [I'm making a $400 passive income out of $2300 investment](/steem/@fr3eze/i-m-making-a-usd400-passive-income-out-of-usd2300-investment). That was an one-time effort and I do not need to approach all the friends and strangers to hard sell the products from MLM company. I break no sweat and I burn no network, as you might aware, people are not very fond of MLM scheme.

## 2.
> If I'm working for the other companies, I would be long delisted from their employee list for being away for straight 22 months. But this company is awesome! They not only keeping their promise but pay me accordingly with justice!

Oh, if investing in Steem considering working for this blockchain, I would still be in the game 1000 year after I'm long dead. No one is kicking me out, no one can decide whether I'm still useful for the *company*. No matter how innovative an MLM company is, they are still centralized. And no matter how stable and trust-worthy the company is, there is still a possibility that you are kicked from the game by a mere sudden decision by a management member. Think this way, how secure can a company be if a country could go bankrupt?

This is a direct comparison between decentralization and centralization application. I tried to explain what risk he is taking but to no avail. He could not even grab the idea of centralization. Of course I might be in the bigger risk considering Steem is just another social experiment in the sea of blockchain project, but at least I acknowledged that risk.

There will be no consensus between us while we trying to convince each other with a completely different opinion. Coincidentally, I wrote a post on this exact topic one month ago, [Steem is better than MLM](/@fr3eze/steem-is-better-than-mlm). Shared it with him after the discussion, let's hope he will enjoy the read.

我有个对传销系统很狂热的友人，最近刚从澳洲 22 个月的*旅游工作计划*回来大马。面对我们这班朋友长久以来的困惑和不理解，他特意写了一大篇信息（作文）来解释为何他对他的传销公司如此有信心，重点摘要如下：

## 1.
>我所经历你未遇见的*不在职收入*，在我离开大马完全无法工作的的 22 个月里，XX 公司坚守承诺的基于我以往的业绩，提供给我每月马币600令吉的收入。

不好意思，我已经遇见了*不在职收入*，而且要比你的好上很多。上一篇[《I'm making a $400 passive income out of $2300 investment》](/steem/@fr3eze/i-m-making-a-usd400-passive-income-out-of-usd2300-investment)就足以说明一切。

## 2.
>要是在别的传统公司，不工作 22 个月我早就除名了。XX公司却不一样，依然定时给予我所应得的分红，XX公司值得信赖！

这就更好笑了，你所谓的信赖完全建立在中心化的组织手中。不管目前如何稳定，总归有被开除的可能性。这样想吧，当一个国家都可以破产时，何况区区一个公司？Steem 这类的区块链项目就不同了，即使在我死后的一千年后我依然还在此局中。除了我自己，没人能决定我的去留。单是这点就高下立判。

凑巧的是，一个月前我正好就此话题写了一篇[《比传销更好》](/@fr3eze/steem-is-better-than-mlm)，立马分享给了我这朋友，希望他好好消化，同时不要拉黑我。
