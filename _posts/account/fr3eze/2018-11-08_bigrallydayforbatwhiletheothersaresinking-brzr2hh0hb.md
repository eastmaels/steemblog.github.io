Not long after the <a href="https://steemit.com/cindicator/@fr3eze/quick5profitwithcindicatorbutthesellorderwasnotclosedyet-z6k2sgjk7u">first post</a>, BAT finally spiked over the target price this afternoon and it even stayed high at 0.00005527 BTC at the time of this writing.

<strong>Impressive over 10%+ gain within such a short amount of time.</strong> Made a total profit of about 0.00475272 BTC(30 USD). Not a fat profit but I'm happy enough.

The BAT must have up to something but I was just too lazy to check it out as I know the Cindicator would normally identify some market events that are potentially profitable thus make a prediction questions on it.

Take a look at the CMC screenshot today, BAT was the only one with <strong>big green</strong> while praised by its red-coloured peers. Wonderful view for a BAT speculator like me at this moment!

<h2>Previous experiment with Cindicator tips was a success took</h2>

I recalled that I made an experiment 3 months ago with the <strong>SUB</strong> coin and totally forgot about it. I will take this opportunity to provide the very belated update now. Take a look at the original post if you are curious:

<strong>It was a success too</strong>, fortunately.

In short, I successfully gain 11% as SUB/BTC did trade above 0.0000209 BTC within the predicted time frame, following the Cindicator tips, of course.

<h2>This is not a promotion.</h2>

To be honest, I'm not trusting whatever Cindicator was feeding me 100% but I guess it would be fun to share how I trade accordingly with an insignificant capital. Undoubtedly, the joy would be doubled if all the indicators were accurate which is, fortunately, the case now.

Let's see what the next interesting indicator I would receive!

Cindicator 又建功啦。这次算是第二次了吧，起初的计划就是<a href="https://steemit.com/cindicator/@fr3eze/afunlittleexperimenttestcindicatorsignalwith01btc-63w1es31bi">用 0.1 BTC 来试一试 Cindicator 给的交易信号有多准</a>。 很幸运的，目前都还没有失手（虽然仅有两次）。简而言之，这次就是在<strong>两天内实现了 BAT 会涨 10% 的预言</strong>。虽然只赚了不痛不痒的 30 刀，也聊胜于无吧！<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/big-rally-day-for-bat-while-the-others-are-sinking/</em><hr/></center>
