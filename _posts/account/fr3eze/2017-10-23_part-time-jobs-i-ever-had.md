When I was a kid my family wasn’t doing well financially, so I develop the habit of working part-time at a young age. I used to proudly regard myself as the king of o part-time when KT comes to working experience discussion.

1. The first job when I was 12 years old was at the **biscuit factory**. We don’t know much about child labor back then.
2. I have a really busy 'career' during high school time. The next job is **car washing** service which was located in the downstairs of my old house. They had a really good business, especially during the public holiday.
3. **Selling school shoe** at a supermarket. Typical white canvas shoe which is the standard shoe for the students in Malaysia.
4. Served as a banquet **waiter** at a 5 start hotel, the Equatorial. Those who can afford to have a ball here aren't the normal boring civilians, I had a good time working there.
5. Worked for my uncle at his **furniture factory**. My uncle is close with my family hence we were treated like his own kid, fetching us back and forth from work and provided meals for us during break time.
6. After high school graduation, did the salesperson role for Ogawa **massage chair**. The products were too expensive and I don't acquired good selling technique hence those 2 months weren't much enjoyable.
7. **Selling fruits** at the night market for 2 weeks. I and my friend were so embarrassed to be recognized by the friends because we will be working in the market nearby our neighborhood.
8. Working at the **construction site** was the most physically taxing job I ever had. This only lasted for one day and I remember I slept like a baby that night at 8 pm right after the hard day.
9. The most interesting job was working as a **croupier** at the Casino. I was mainly conducting the Roulette table game which was much hard than conducting the poker games. The odds were complicated and we have to do the mental calculation, no calculator was allowed. Croupier has a nice pay too. I should write more about this next time.
10. Selling handphones, promoting Jacuzzis, food and beverage sampling at the malls and so on. 

Some of my peers not even worked for a part-time before they get their real job after the college. Maybe they don't have to, maybe they were too lazy for that. Working for part-time job as a teenager student wasn't an easy path but I kind of miss those days when I look back though.

从小家境不好，自小就有兼职打工的习惯。尤其是为期数个礼拜连续假期，许多孩子都去寻找乐子的时候，我和几个志同道合的小玩伴都会提前就准备寻找工作。想起那段日子，其实也不以为苦。在那个物资贫乏的年代，也还不流行什么兴趣班之类的，要是不出外打工还真的不知道日子要如何度过。何况打工赚钱，开学后也可以有闲钱花，何乐而不为。

记得学生时期也颇以兼职经验丰富而自豪，常向友人吹嘘自己是兼职皇帝。大学毕业后才正式有了第一份工作，摆脱了兼职皇帝的身份。现在来数数兼职过的工作有哪些。

1. 小学毕业就找了第一份兼职，当年应该是十二岁吧，还是个非法童工，当初人们对童工的概念没那么重。那是一份在**饼干工厂**的差事。还记得那里的卫生条件非常不堪，以至以后都对那类型的饼干抱有点阴影。这份工作维持两三个月，然后就升上中学了。忘了当初的工资是一天马币12元还是20元，总之就是非常狗血，但当初可是开心得很了。

2. 中学初期，在自家楼下的**洗车厂**做兼职，断断续续做了有一两年吧。从洗车洒水到抹干上油样样都做，纯粹是体力活。每年的农历新年前夕是全年的高峰期，一天从早上九点到下午六点可以洗上整百俩的车，洗完了就回去冲个凉吃团圆饭去了。当时还和小伙伴们分析老板赚了多少钱，感觉这生意真有赚头。

3. 中学时期十六岁左右，在超市卖过两个月的**小白鞋**，也就是俗称的校鞋。这间公司帮我开设了政府的公积金户口，所以我比同龄人更早就拥有公积金，当时提起还是挺得意的。

4. 中学高中时期和哥们在一间五星酒店Equatorial做**酒席侍者**。一个小时马币四块钱吧，周末高点。这份工作也断断续续做了好几年。由于来到这类型酒店举办酒宴的人都有一点来路，这中间也挺多趣事发生的。试过最忙的时候，就是凌晨六时开工，晚上十二时收工，真正的是不见天日。

5. 同时期也在伯伯的**家私工厂**打过工。工厂主要承包学校类的工程，即是各种木制的学生书桌，时而也有高官达贵的定制式家私。由于是老板是亲近的自家伯父，上下班都是由他载送，晚午餐也是伯母自煮的。现在他们年老力衰，也还没退休。所以有时候我暑假回去碰到他们出货的日子也会去帮帮忙。

6. 中学毕业后，卖过两个月的Ogawa**按摩椅**。第一次做销售类的，因为主要都是主打价值马币八千的按摩椅，所以真的很不好卖，那两个月我只零零碎碎卖了一些周边，让我对销售失去了信心，觉得自己没有这方面的天赋。

7. 上大学前，在夜市摆档口**卖水果**，也是粗重的工作，体力差一点可做不来。当时因为会去家里附近的夜市开档，还怕给熟人认出而难为情。做了两个礼拜撑不住了。在水果厂见识过如山的各类水果，还处理过很多腐烂的木瓜蜜瓜，那浓郁的味道导致后期对这些水果有些阴影。

8. 在工地做**建筑工**是我试过最粗重的活，好像做了一天就倒下了。当初身材瘦小，抱着做这种体力活可以锻炼身体又可以赚钱的心态，跟着堂哥去工地报到了。用水桶杠调好了的水泥，用人手制作的山寨梯子爬上天花板拉电线，徒手用铁锤凿子在墙上打出电路开关的位置。记得当晚回到家八九点就睡着了，还睡得很香。

9. 大学时期，在赌场做了两三年的**荷官**。这是迄今为止最有趣的工作了。我的主要游戏是负责轮盘，轮盘比起其他扑克类的游戏难度高很多。赔率更复杂而且全靠心算，还有在轮盘里打珠子也需要纯熟的手活。报酬而言也是所有兼职里最好的。可惜到后来我就被赌场拉入黑名单了。下次应该好好分享关于做荷官的趣事。

10. 还有各种卖手机，卖按摩浴缸，试吃部门等等。越说越多了，有机会下次再选些有趣的来说吧。

    从小到现在已经做过十几份不同类型的兼职，有些朋友则到出社会之前一份兼职都没做过。他们自有优越的家庭背景，或是自身也不想那么劳累。起码对我而言，这些经历是宝贵和值得回味的。
