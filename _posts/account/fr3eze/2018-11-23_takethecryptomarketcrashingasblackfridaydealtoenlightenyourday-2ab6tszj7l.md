Happy Black afriday shopping! While you busy checking out the carts of favourtite items. Don't forget the whole crypto market is starting the grand sale too.

That flash crash of crypto few days ago were surely saddening to most of us. But if could sounds reasonable and even acceptable if we try to link it with the yearly Black Friday sale which is mainly affecting the tech products. Most of the digital coins are following the <em>7 days Amazon Black Friday Sale</em>.

The whole market is now with at least 20% off and Steem was even achieving an amazing 50% discount deal! Of course this would largely depends on one's confidence on crypto after all the dramas.

I'm surely to pick up some after my trip from Macau if the price level still maintains.

Take a look of the top 5 coins sale as well if they have a higher priority in your list.
