I've been in a huge web designing mood lately trying to figure out a way to draft the very first web page, while trying to take the shortcut by not touching the code at all. I know I have to deal with some code at some point of time but that let's keep that minimal and at least after a prototype was done.

<strong>Webflow</strong> appears to the <a href="https://steemit.com/computer/@fr3eze/webflowthebestdrag-and-dropwebsitebuildertool-6zd4ubjb5b">perfect tool for this purpose</a>. It offers the best drag-and-drop tool and aims to help web designers get the job done in a much faster pace, provided one has already grasp all the knowledge of using the <em>Designer</em> tool.

I was trying to avoid picking up the HTML &amp; CSS &amp; JS for the sake of speedy development but I still gotta pick up the skills to use another tool. <strong>Skipping one learning curve, another one is waiting ahead.</strong> Funny huh.

Nonetheless, I believe this is the right path to take if all I want is <strong>speed</strong>. And the more I dive into the Webflow, the more I'm impressed how organised and well-structured this product is. For a total new user like me, their <a href="https://university.webflow.com/">Webflow University</a> offers a very rich tutorial content both in text and video format.
