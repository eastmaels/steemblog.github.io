Encountered an interesting question on a forum: *Can a loser break the bottleneck in life by 'all in' cryptocurrency?*

I would not consider myself a loser, but I'm cool if someone regard me as the average or ordinary guy that normally fill up 90% of the street. 

As an avearge guy, I have a dream of becoming financially success too. Without any solid idea of how should I achieve that, for the first time I see the light of hope in cryptocurrency.

## I gradually ALL IN the crypto

But not really the same *all in* philosophy as people might assumed.

Starting from the first day study about Bitcoin and blockchain and much other altcoins, my confidence and interest level grows everyday. There was a sense telling me that this is likely the future, grab it now or grab it later with higher price.

I slowly invested most of my investable money into crypto. Moving other investment asset to crypto. Selling away my index fund stock for the Bitcoin. Invest in ICO using ETH occasionally.

Crypto is now a huge part of my investment portfolio. I know the risk is getting higher with a more centralized profile. But this is the risk that I'm willing to take, and I can only sustain this kind of risk with one condition:

## Never invest in something I do not know

At least finish the whitepaper and take part in active community like Reddit for a particular project is crucial to keep one informed on the latest development or news.

Always invest for long term instead of speculating for short term trading. The time is more well spent on studying projects rather than on frequent buy and sell.

After all, you want to make your 'all in' decision as comfortable as possible to stay with. So stop selling the house away for crypto investment.

On the other hand, money is not the only way to *all in* crypto...

前一阵子在币问遇到个很有趣的问题：
*币圈目前这个阶段，屌丝 All in 有机会翻身吗？*

我也是屌丝，我也是 All in。但是方法可能跟你理解的有点不同。

我尽可能把不会影响生活的钱，全部投进我觉得有前途的项目中。而不是单一项目，而且只投入我有做过功课并且理解的项目，而不是盲投。

随着我对区块链和各个项目的了解加深，加密货币已经成了我投资账面上最大的一块了。当然这么做的风险也会随之提高，所以基层的知识很信仰会让长期的持有更容易坚持。

最后，而花钱还不是 All in 币圈的唯一门道…
