One of the online ethic is to serve the seed back when you have completed the torrent downloading, especially after having a good time with it. I got the old movie Good Will Hunting by a fairly quality torrent where the download was done within minutes. Great movie as I expected, superb video/audio quality and very nice embed caption. I'm not a human not seeding it back to the community.

They often say you should give back to the society when you have achieved enough. Well, at current stage I believe society give me more than what I can give it back. But at least I seed more back after I've leeched the torrent. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/seed-the-torrent-after-leeching/ </em><hr/></center>
