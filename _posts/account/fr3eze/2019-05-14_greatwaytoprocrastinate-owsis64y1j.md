One of the most effective procrastination tasks is to <em>choose wallpaper</em>. I personally do not surfing cool photo site like <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a> without setting a countdown timer. Tons of great photo from a bunch of awesome photographers which anyone can use, for free.

Apply this technique in the middle of a busy schedule, it works wonders and you would be amazed how fast time can actually pass, at the time totally delaying the important task that matters! <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/great-way-to-procrastinate/ </em><hr/></center>
