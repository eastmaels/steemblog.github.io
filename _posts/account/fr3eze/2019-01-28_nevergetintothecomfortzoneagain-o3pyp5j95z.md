Now I regretted not to always keeping myself up in my industry as a system administrator. Found out a large part of the demanding skills are not available on the current working place, or I just those was not as crucial to pick up. I was always trying to keep myself out of the comfort zone and I think that's everyone biggest enemy in every aspect. Ironically, it seems like I'm <em>in the zone</em> now.

Nothing is too late to be fixed. At least I know what is the more marketable skillsets and I can always pick up from here. At the same time, I get myself a couple of sysadmin books that I wish I read at the beginning of my career. It is always good to see how the true experts and gurus get their jobs done.

Heard good things about these books and I'm reading the first one:
- The Practice of System and Network Administration
- UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook
- Essential-System-Administration

Head over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis">Library Genesis</a> if you are just want to have some test reading sample, but always remember to support the author by purchasing the book in store if you think they worth it. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/never-get-into-the-comfort-zone-again/ </em><hr/></center>
