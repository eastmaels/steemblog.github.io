Get my first domain registered for the first time. I'm a not really familiar with the practice of the web industry but it seems rather <em>rather traditional</em> in front of blockchain. The ICANN makes it a requirement for all the registration must comply with real personal or company identification which is very much against my personal preference. One can of course providing fake information but that would be placing the ownership of that domain at stake. The centralization of ICANN in the web industry is just dominating and the only way I can think of, is to utilise the decentralization power by blockchain. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/we-need-anonymity-on-domain-registration/ </em><hr/></center>
