## Steemit as miniature of the Internet

Everyone know how big the internet porn is. But you might not have a clear mind [how big it actually is](http://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/how-much-internet-porn-9784557).

![porn-infographic](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2c/92/2b/2c922b6d038147a72f235e6db474759d--mind-blowing-facts-world-news-headlines.jpg) 

By all these studies we can tell pornography is so linked to human nature. That's the result of freedom provided by Internet. Wipe out the whole internet search history of mankind and start everything over again, one hour later you will find the same amount of traffic to the porn sites. As much as Steemit granted so much freedom to the user that no other social medias can even come close, **same thing is likely to take place here**.

*These are the trending  top payout topics. God know will someday tags like '#NSFW' '#porn' '#sexy' be at their pinnacle?*

## Will this kill Steemit?

Well, I would keep a wait-and-see attitude how thing is going to play out. 
Steemit grants us the ability to "Say No to Internet Censorship". That's why we love it. People up-voting quality works, flagging the contrast. And flagging is the only way to censor a content by reducing its visibility in the platform, but the content isn't going anywhere. I'd say this is the right how things should be "censored" by users instead of centralized authorities. 

Finally, as Steemit is still in the infant stage considering how much we expecting it to be the next Reddit killer, I shouldn't be over-worried by now. By the time I should, this is gonna be a happy trouble.
