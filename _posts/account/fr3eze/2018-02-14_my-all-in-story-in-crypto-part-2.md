Continue from the part 1 story : [My ALL IN story in crypto(part1)](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@fr3eze/my-all-in-story-in-crypto-part-1)

Besides of *all in* cryptocurrency financially, I devote my time and effort into this space as much as possible as well. One can simply *all in* to any market by just investing money, and that's easy to do. The hardest part is invest the time and seek information on build faith and knowledge about them.

## Involve in the projects, not trading the coins.

There are several crypto-related activities already become part of my routine:

- Keep posting on Steem. Trying out new application like @zappl or @dmania. Socialize with others. If someone tell me that I would blog a several hundreds of word daily, I would call them crazy. And now this is exactly what I'm doing everyday with much joy.

- Making forecast in Cindicator. Being a frequent visitor to Coinmarketcap.com and reader to crypto-news site like Coindesk.com, I can't help but addictively following development of the crypto space. Good that I could express my prediction using Cindicator while stand a chance to win some prizes.

- Answering question in Bitask.com. This is a Quara-like Q&A site for the Chinese community. Bitask is specifically designed for crypto-related discussion only, I could express my thoughts and opinions on the topic I'm interested. Good answers or questions could be rewarded with YOYOW coin.

## Never stop studying

Other than the above-mentioned, I also read books and watch videos about crypto, for example, Mr Andreas @aanton is always my best source of knowledge and I encourage everyone to learn his insightful thoughts.

All these helped me to build a solid understanding in blockchain fundamental. Therefore, I found it easy to stay calm no matter in bull or bear market. At the same time, I was enabled to differentiate real blockchain or bullsh*t projectss while seeking for new opportunities.

This is how I *all in* to cryptocurrency.

[上文](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@fr3eze/my-all-in-story-in-crypto-part-1)提到金钱不是唯一 All in 加密货币的方法。除了早期频繁的交易货币，我从不懈怠的投入时间精力在学习新信息上。

有些事情已经成了生活的一部分。比如每日在 Steem 坚持发文，和别人互动交流；在币问回答我有兴趣的问题赚取Yoyow；利用我对市场的研究心得在 Cindicator 进行预测。

学习和投资货币是相辅相成的，在这过程中我一直都很享受，还有点不能自拔了。

我想这样的 All in 方式最是正确不过吧！
