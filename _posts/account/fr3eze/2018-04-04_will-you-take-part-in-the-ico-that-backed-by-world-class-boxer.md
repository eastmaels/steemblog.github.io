What can you directly link to when someone mentions the name of Floyd Mayweather? Boxing. He is one of the most legendary boxers with the undefeated record and made a shit ton of money. If he comes and offering me a boxing class or give me one or two tips on boxing, it would be more than welcome.

However, if he texts me and said "Look dude, I think I found a golden goose in ICO/IPO/stocks. Let's making money together!" Will I listen to him? A big no-brainer NO of course. Why would I take a financial advice from a professional boxer in the first place? 

The ICO fraud happened because Floyd influences did take effect that the ICO he backed did very well in collecting fund, but unfortunately some of the ICO ran away with investors money. Who are those investors? Floyd's fans are definitely part of the victims. Is Floyd lost his money as well? Nobody can make sure whether he did invest in the ICO that he backed, but I'm sure his pockets are full of cash for the 'advertisement' service.

I'm sorry for the victims but people really need to learn a lesson the hard way. **You become a fan of a boxer by admiring his performance on the stage, not because he is wise at making financial investment.** Let alone the dangerous crypto space. People need to get their logic right.
