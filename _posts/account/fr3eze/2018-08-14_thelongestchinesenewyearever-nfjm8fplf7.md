The crypto started the year 2018 with a crisp dipping from its all time high total marketcap from 800 billion. The FUB starts to spread around the investors and suddenly a bunch of experienced guys jumped out everywhere to claim such dipping was due to the <em>Chinese New Year</em> effect. The Chinese were cashing out crypto to buy stuff for the CNY celebration. I certainly laughed hard ovet that statement and took that as a complete joke. But soon I realised it seems like more than just a joke.

Hmmm, it definitely looks convincing except I did not cashing out my coins for the CNY as a Chinese myself. Anyway, I was hoping they will end the celebration soon and get the hot money back in the crypto market.

Looking at the ever down trending chart, I guess the CNY is still going on. Gong Xi Fa Cai!

年初，去到最高点的货币市场开始出现下滑的迹象。当这个情况越演越烈时，有一帮<em>经验丰富</em>货币投资家出来安抚人心，说这是每年年头都会出现的下滑现象。主要原因是<strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/7r2pw7/seems_to_be_a_yearly_dip_around_chinese_new_year/">中国人都把钱从市场提出来买年货庆祝农历新年</a></strong>了。听起来好像很有道理，看一看今天的价格表，应该是春节还没完吧！
