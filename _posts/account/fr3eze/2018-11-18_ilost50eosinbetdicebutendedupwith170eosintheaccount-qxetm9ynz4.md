<h2>Is the economy-sharing casino model the next big thing in gambling games?</h2>

I was <em>enthusiastically devoted</em> to the EOC dice betting game after the first try in BetDice. Despite the first few wins, I'm not going to lie that I have lost all the gains on top of the capitals eventually, just like the 1000 stories the other gamblers would have told you how they ended up sleeping under the bridge. Except, I'm still able to keep my cosy bed after the loss.

I then found out the DICE tokens that I accumulated during the gaming time now worth something!

<h2>Actually, it worths way more than my past gain and lost capital combined!</h2>

Here is how the DICE tokens work:
- The smart contract in BetDice gives you 12 DICE tokens for every 1 EOS being bet. 
- Staking up DICE token granted the ability to share the payout pool every hour.

Bam! You have a steady stream of passive income now.</sub></center>

Pretty impressive and brilliant business model I would say. Considering the how generous the banker to set up a payout pool from their pocket, Betdice actually did gain more than losing by encouraging users to keep betting.

<code>Bet more to get more DICE -&gt; Stake more DICE to gain more passive payout -&gt;</code>. According to Newton's Law stated that

<blockquote>
  Banker always win.

</blockquote>

Gamblers are pouring the EOS to Betdice non-stop in the hope of getting more DICE and winning the actual bets, of course.

<h2>I was getting 90k DICE.</h2>

Looking at the <a href="https://betdice.one/exchange">native exchange system</a>, 1 DICE is now worth 0.0019 EOS. <code>90,000*0.0019=171</code>. Dang, my loss was way under 50 EOS and those token that I gained along the process which I thought was shitty now worth way more than everything I had bet with the game? Fantastic!

Hoping for a better price now to sell them all away!</sub></center>

In no way, I'm encouraging gambling but if you want to have a little fun, feel free to use my referral link to try it out:

<strong>Pro tips</strong>: Only login amount of EOS that you are willing to lose and <strong>stake the remaining EOS up</strong> before betting. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/i-lost-50-eos-in-betdice-but-ended-up-with-170-eos-in-the-account/ </em><hr/></center>
