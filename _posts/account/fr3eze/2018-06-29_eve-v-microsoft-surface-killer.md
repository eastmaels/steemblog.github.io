Ever want to get 2-in-1 laptop like the Microsoft Surface Pro which is the king in this field, but scared off by the steep price? Don't need be anymore. 

**Eve V** is the first crowd-developed computer. Every details was discussed and voted in the eve community before the official manufacturer actually forge it out to the market. This way, all the details gets the best practicality and value because **this product was build literally from the perspective of end-users**.

To make Eve V the true Surface killer, they both have the exact same look, only Eve V come with way more features!

## More features for less price, for real!

I will briefly list out all the extra juices you will get on Eve V while having all the advantages as Surface does:

- Comes with a detachable Bluetooth keyboard with RGB lighting which can be used as cover as well. (Surface doesn't come with one, and the keyboard is just a normal wired one.)
- Comes with a stylus called V Pen, for free! (Again, you have to buy it for Surface.)
- Larger battery, thanks to the community members who finally make laptop makers understand that we all prefer a stronger battery life than an unnoticeable slimmer body build.
- Stealthy look without a large ugly logo on the body. 
- Fingerprint sensor for logging in and it is as quick as modern phone's, this sounds like a dream to me!
- A lot more I/O ports, 2x Full-size USB 3.0 Gen 1, 1x USB 3.0 Gen 1 USB-C, and even a **1x Thunderbolt 3 USB-C**, what??

The list goes on, I can't list them all. Check it out on the [fancy website](https://eve-tech.com/pages/eve-v)!

After everything, comparing the Microsoft Surface Pro 2017 with Eve V with same spec, it is $3,326 vs $1599:
