Recently I bumped into the *free coin* space where you can get all kinds of new coins from fresh projects. I even [wrote a post to promote some of them](https://busy.org/@fr3eze/here-is-the-list-of-projects-running-airdrop-register-while-stock-last). All the airdrop coins that I've been referring requires zero investment and are pretty straight-forward. 

There are tons and tons of new ICO coming up and use airdropping as the marketing strategy. So it is almost impossible to track all of them down wishing to participate into all airdrops. I just taking part in some of them just for the fun and you can never know what would happen to these coins in the future.

## These crazy wave of airdrops reminds me something

As I mentioned in the previous post, almost all of the new projects that running airdrops are base on Ethereum. That being said, Ether(ETH) is already in huge demand as all the ERC20 tokens will need it to process transactions. To make this observation further base on the fact that ICO will only grow more in 2018, **decentralized platform projects will grow along definitely**.

## Impossibility to predict which ICO will have the final success

While you will use all kind of benchmark like team background, execution ability or technologies to judge the possibility of which new projects will stand out eventually, it is not hard to admit that we still can't be sure of what things will become in the future. 

## However, platforms that support the sea of ICO certainly have a brighter future. 

Coins like **Ethereum, NEO,  Cardano, EOS** and the similar will always be the hotbed of ICO at least for 2018. As the infrastructure getting more mature it is almost irresistible not to use the ready-made service to issue new coins and crowdfunding for new projects. By doing so the new coin can directly share the existing crowd of a particular decentralized platform while do not have to worry about technical troubles of the blockchain, they will have more time to deal with other issues.

Overall, hosting new coin on decentralized platform is a win-win situation for both sides as it creates a virtuous cycle.

最近铺天盖地的 ICO 着实令人吃惊，看来 2018 会是各种新 ICO 的爆发年。这也是我从最近各式各样的货币空投活动所发现的趋势，还有一个更重要的的走势就是，现在绝大多数的 ICO 都是建立在 ETH 平台上，所以 ETH 地址是参与空投活动的必备条件之一。

这也提醒了我，既然 ICO 几乎确定了是会继续红火下去的事实，那么为何不投资在好像 ETH 般提供孵化新货币的去中心化温床呢？类似的项目还有熟悉的 EOS，Cardano，NEO，等等。

在如海潮般的 ICO 里要挑出最后的赢家难度很可能真的象大海捞针一般，对我来说，投资在新项目们的孵化中心会是更明智的选择。

上图是我昨日在新加坡的室内云雾森林所拍摄，墙上的艺术形态像极了某加密货币的图标，你猜得出来吗？
