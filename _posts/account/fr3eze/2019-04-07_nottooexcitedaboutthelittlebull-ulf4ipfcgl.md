Not sure is it the Steemit layout or SteemPlus plugin added this little <em>Coin Marketplace</em> on the home page. Reminds me that the recent market has bulled a little and we all are glad that happen so "soon". Personally I'm not too excited about it, I'm glad that my current holdings became a little more worthy that dirt. Maybe I would be cheered more if I bought the low in significant amount when I could.

But I didn't. Not because I lost trust in the crypto market (opposite, I know it will come back anyhow), but I had a financial hard time this period. Else I would really load my ass up in the low tide.

Let's see if the market would holds up for long. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/not-too-excited-about-the-little-bull/ </em><hr/></center>
