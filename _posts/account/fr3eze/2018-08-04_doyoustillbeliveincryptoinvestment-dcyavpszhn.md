<h2>Learned about the crypto the weird way</h2>

I'm a late adopter of crypto started back in the middle of last year when Bitcoin starts to get viral to all the non-crypto-geek circle. Not to say I get to know Bitxoin due to a traditional, shaddy pyramid scheme based money game, which brought me some hard times but I'm still grateful as it linked to me the most famous digital currency.

<h2>Been to the ATH</h2>

In 2017, that was some sweet old days seeing everything you've put in going only in on direction, up up and up! That moment you feel like making money was never so easy. After the all-time-high 800 billion dollar crypto marketcap, it starts to collapse amd dip. And still struggling today around 250B total marketcap.

<h2>From sensitive to numb.</h2>

I did not realise any paper profit(then) nor lost(now) into fiat as I planned to be a strong Holder in the first place. I still remember the day I worry about every single negative news about crypto and and smile upon good news even for the slightest one. Trading coins in and out was part of my daily activity, I knew almost all the recent price movement of famous coins. Hoping the almighty crypto would bring me out of the boring rat race of working life.

But here I am, still working the same 9-5 job and continueing the rat racing.

Crypto news bring much less impact now to my feels and I no longer trading actively. I stopped react to those news in a big way as I used to. <strong>The only thing remains the same is my confidence in the blockchain technology.</strong>

You asking for prove? Maybe because I'm still alive in Steem?<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/do-you-still-belive-in-crypto-investment/</em><hr/></center>
