I'm glad this contest has finally comes to an end and our dear Steem won the first place <a href="http://contest.gonetcoins.com/">2 days ago</a>. Basically, this is exactly the game Steem should not lose as the competitors were not as  community-based as Steem was designed for.

We had the innate advantages over the over coins like Verge, Pac, INS and so on. Yet embarassingly, by hook or by crook they did a great job putting up a huge contest for us who claimed to have 50k active daily users.

Well, it seems like probably we don't even have 5k real human users to struggle so hard for the first place. This is in fact a good information for all of us to clear that illusion like  <em>Steem is the most active and participated crypto network ever</em> or things like that.

Let's see the free listing on Netcoins would bring in some actual users from the market as expected or not. Keep on Steeming!<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/we-won-the-contest-of-spamming/</em><hr/></center>
