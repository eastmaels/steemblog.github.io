Won this figure from a Arcade center in Japan. It was a figure capturing machine that you can try to catch the figure using a claw, each attempt cost 100 Yen.

I'm a big fan of Dragonball and got lucky to caught this within 5 attempts. It would costs around 2000 Yen for a figure like this.

The figure is created with amazing details that I wonder it was hand crafted or mass production by machine. All the body posture and face expression is perfectly mimics the Goku in comics. Amazing job.
