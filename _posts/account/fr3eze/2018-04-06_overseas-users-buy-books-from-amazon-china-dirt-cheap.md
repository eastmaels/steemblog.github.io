Preparing for a long journey on the bus tomorrow, I think that filling up my Kindle with new books would be a great idea. Being a big fan of Mr Louis Cha Leung-yung and read his books for endless time, this would be a good chance to buy the newly revised edition of **The Deer and the Cauldron**(鹿鼎记）. 

Amazon China is always the best place for buying chinese kindle books but sadly they have a limitation that only people in China could make a purchase. The good news is, it seems like Amazon China do not implement the limitation very strictly that oversea chinese readers can still buy books from the service. 

This detailed guide will show you exactly how to do it: https://kindlemalaysia.com/buy-chinese-ebooks-amazoncn-outside-china/

I purchased whole 5 volumes of the book for just RMB 80 which could easily be 3x on the other online bookstore. What a steal!

明天的漫漫巴士长途行程在即，消耗时光而言有什么能比得上好书呢？所以我决定了入手新修版的神作《鹿鼎记》。中国亚马逊可是全球最大的中文书库，拥有 Kindle 的我怎么能够错过。通过[这篇攻略](https://kindlemalaysia.com/amazon-china/)解决了海外购书问题，最后成功以￥80入手了全五册的《鹿鼎记》，要知道在外头可能花上三倍的价格都未必买到，这里还多了亚马逊+Kindle 的无缝连接体验，实在是超值！
