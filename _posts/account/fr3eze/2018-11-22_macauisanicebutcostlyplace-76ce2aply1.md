I'm gonna spend a few days of vacation with my family in Macau. A place that I love so much about the food and atmosphere since my first visit 2 years ago. I was on a business trip back then and that's the very reason made me ignore the high living expenses here since everything could be reimbursed from the company.

Now we are spending all on our own just to realise that the food here was still nice as usual but <strong>freaking expensive</strong>. The price is even higher than HK and SG. But it's alright. We will get used to it the next day.

Can't wait to explore the city where I was spending 3 week living in it, now coming back as a full-time traveller!

It would be hard to keep up with my daily posting routine here but at least I'm gonna share some photos for the next few days. Good opportunity also to keep me away from the red sea of crypto market for a while, you know it very well. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/macau-is-a-nice-but-costly-place/ </em><hr/></center>
