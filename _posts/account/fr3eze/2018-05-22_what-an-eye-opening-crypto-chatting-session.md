This is a recap for a small Steem meetup back in last Sunday. I'm honoured to be invited to the lunch by @jrvacation. It was a rainy afternoon, the restaurant wasn't crowded, the food was great, and the people are nice. I had a great time.

Maybe one of the biggest surprises to me is having to meet up a real crypto guy and a very reputable figure in the Steem space himself, @knozaki2015.

## Impressive crypto knowledge and experience

Coming from the place where crypto or blockchain is still very much regarded as a tool of ponzi schemes, I always feel like a lone ranger after discovering how big the blockchain tech can be for this planet. Most of the guys I've talked to are not convinced even just to open an account in Steemit with zero cost and minor effort at all.

I think Mr Knozaki was my first one to exchanged so much coin names in real life conversation with. The only difference is, I was just heard of those coins because they made it to the top 100 in Coinmarketcap, but he discovered it all when they were under the radar.

## Something you ignored today might be the next big thing tomorrow.

There are unlimited supply of Bitcoin success stories since the boom of BTC last year, reading them will always lead me to the envious thinking like "If only I could buy that $4 BTC back in the old days...". I think people used to think their younger self was more ignorant and often duller compared to the wiser position they are at today, such concept would be more obvious when recalling something you've done wrong or big opportunities that you've missed in the past. 

Well, I was a mindless boy wasting my time at the University time back in 2010 and I was dirt poor there is nothing I can do if I found out Bitcoin that time. Yeah, maybe I can tell that to myself to make the *regret of missing out* lighter. 

I would say that I'm a lot wiser these recent years, and I missed the Steem in 2016, too.

The moral of the story here is, **the opportunities are always there for us all**. Looking back to the recent *get-rich-quick* history events, the Internet era like Apple and Google when they were just penny stocks, cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum when they cost less than a pack of cigarette, I must not forget to mention how dirt-cheap was Steem. I missed them all. I really have to start to believe there are always some next BTC-like possibilities lurking around.

Keep the eyes open, and always stay informed will be the best guideline ahead I guess.

## It takes more than just luck to succeed in crypto

Thanks to the man Knozaki showed us how amazing the crypto world, he got our jaws dropped though he was sharing like it was nothing. He was so humble to give all credit to the luck for his success in crypto but Nah, I know it takes way more than pure luck to get to that position.

They said get yourself a mentor no matter what field you're developing in, and Knozaki is simply the perfect guy in crypto. Such a shame we didn't have enough time to have a deeper conversation. Well, who said we can't have more meet-ups in the future right(hopefully haha)?

Lastly, glad to know also the lovely @yoshiko from the Japanese community. Impressive translator machine you have got there and I hope you enjoy the days in SG!
