It seems like foldable phone is the next big thing in the mobile technology. I can image how hard for such tech to be finally realised in real life, and all the phone vendors starts to treat it as a must have feature for next generation of phone. The reaction of crowd was motivating for this cutting-edge of phone as well.

But I just can't get it. Foldable phone is impressive visually and that's for sure, however I fail to see how innovative it is in term of functionality. It might change the user experience with ordinary phones, perhaps improve the visual experience slightly. But that is not going to justify the crazyass price tags those vendors put on those phones.

I mean, when the fingerprint sensor was first introduced in mobile phone. It might not received a fanatic response but it was truly innovative to improve the user interaction with their phone. No more password typing and screen sliding during unlocking session. The satisfaction is day and night.

But the ability to halve/double the screen size? Not really.

折叠手机似乎是手机界的最新潮流。根据目前所收到的热烈回响，无可避免的未来好几代手机都会在<em>折叠能力</em>上大做文章。我最这个现象就非常的费解，折叠屏幕的技术实现是很了不起，难度也可想而知。但是它带来的实际用户体验，真的有如它们的价格涨幅之大？

当初指纹解锁在手机上出现的时候似乎没有如今这般的热烈反应，对我而言往回头看，那才是真正划时代的体验升级。从按密码和在屏幕上滑动，到轻轻一按就立马解锁，简直不要太爽。 <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/foldable-phones-i-dont-get-the-point/ </em><hr/></center>
