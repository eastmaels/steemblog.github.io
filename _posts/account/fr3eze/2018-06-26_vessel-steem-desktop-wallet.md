I can't believe no one was hunting this awesome product yet on the very Steem blockchain!
**Vessel** is a desktop wallet for Steem developed by the witness @jesta. This wallet aims to deal with all the Steem fund management. Whatever the active key supports to do, Vessel can do it.

- Very friendly GUI and running smoothly without issue. Clean and simplistic interface and with helpful information everywhere.
- You can add more than one account into the same wallet and manage them all at once.
- **Overview** page shows all the information about STEEM, SBD, SP, and Vests.
- **Vesting** feature allows one to power down and redirect the amount to another target account, with the option to auto power up the target account upon fund arrival.
- **Create account** immediately with the help of some Steem and SP. I would say this is one of the killer features to allow instant Steem account creation.
- View who is you delegate to, and add/remove them with ease.
- Control the witness voting in a few clicks. 
- Broadcast a Custom JSON operation to the Steem blockchain(advanced operations).

Not to mention basic operation like claiming reward, sending fund, encrypt memo and etc. <center>**Vessel is the only tool you needed when it comes to fund management.**</center>
