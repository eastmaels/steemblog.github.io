Macauzs weather has been kind to us so far and I'm definitely grateful. The biggest enemy is the potential rainy day due to the season and we as the tropical folks never been so hoping for a bright sun now.

Temperature was constantly at 21℃ which is optimal for human comfortability level. This is also one of the biggest reason we chose to visit the city of gambling at Nov.

Crypto market is down as usual, I gotta make sure to pray hard for it on every Chinese temples that we are going to visit from now on as there are just plenty here.

This is one of the oldest and most famous Naza(哪咤)Temple that amazed me today for ita authenticity and the feel of age. Love it.
