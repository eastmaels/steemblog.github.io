Iâ€™m a big fan of using the right tool for the right stuff, in the digitalised age with Internet, it is never been so easy to get opinions on what is the best tool for a certain task. Unfortunately, that can be the deepest trap of time to even get the task started.

A few months ago I decided to pick up some Python skills and one of the very first things is not getting to the documentation, but to choose the <em>best code editor for Python</em> or <em>best Python IDE</em>. Soon I learnt that an organised tutorial or bootcamp could be a great help, hence the next research in the topic of <em>best way to learn Python</em>, <em>best Python bootcamp</em>, <em>Python book recommendation</em>.

Days, if not weeks, gone into the tool researching instead of getting into the real deal and picking up the codings. It turns out, the variation of tools available out there for a reason, they are unique in some of the way and the only way to test if they suit your need is to download and start using it.

<em>Keep the researching short and get to the real shit straight.</em> You are going to learn more in the process even starting off by not using the <em>best tool</em>. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/what-is-your-biggest-cause-to-procrastinate/ </em><hr/></center>
