Build my current PC rig more than half a year ago which was a huge upgrade from my precious performance laptop. Sold that laptop away for not using its portability at all as I almost never bring it around, the biggest reason is that gaming laptop is just too heavy and bulky for a comfortable travel. The laptop plus charger could add up to 6kg if I'm not wrong.

Here I present the new awesome PC that serves me damn well for half of the year. Although I convert the 6kg laptop combination to this desktop rig which could be as heavy as 25ky combining all the peripherals including the 12kg speaker, I never look back for a moment.

- **Monitor:** Dell UltraSharp 27 QHD Monitor U2717D `[SGD 739]`
- **Speaker:** HiVi M200MKIII 2.0 Hi-Fi speakers `[RMB 1199/SGD 270]`
- **Keyboard:** DREVO Excalibur Tenkeyless 84Key Full Metal Mechanical  Keyboard `[USD 65.99/SGD 87]`
- **Mouse:** Razer Deathadder Chroma 2016

Except for the mouse, the rest were all newly bought for this rig. Had no complaint about every one of them. The QHD monitor just makes multitasking feel like a breeze, plenty of screen real estates to work with and not to mention the brilliant color presentation by Dell IPS panel. Highly recommended.

- **Case:** Fractal Design Define Mini C with Window MicroATX Mid Tower Case
- **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 1600 3.2GHz 6-Core Processor
- **Motherboard:** ASRock AB350M Pro4 Micro ATX AM4 Motherboard
- **Secondary Storage:** Seagate - Barracuda 2TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive
- **Power Supply:** EVGA SuperNOVA G3 650W 80+ Gold Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply
Total `[SGD 840]`

- **Memory:** Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-3200 Memory `[USD 134.99/SGD 178]`
- **First Storage:** Samsung 960 EVO 250GB M.2-2280 Solid State Drive `[USD 127.99/SGD 169]`

The CPU alone totally cost `SGD 1187`which is 187 more than my original budget of SGD 1000. If you are geek enough you might already the rig is missing a very important component. Yes, the true essence of a performance rig, the Graphic card! At the time of building this rig, GPU is too overpriced for the exploding crypto mining demand. And that overpricing trend continues till today, that's why my PC is still running on a low-end GPU just for the sake of providing video output.

Total cost of CPU + peripheral equals to `SGD 2283` as of now without GPU. Which could become a rig worth of SGD 3000 in the final form. Never expected I would build a 3k rig nor I could expect to have such privilege to own a desktop PC this expensive.

This is a note for my first rig building conclusion.
