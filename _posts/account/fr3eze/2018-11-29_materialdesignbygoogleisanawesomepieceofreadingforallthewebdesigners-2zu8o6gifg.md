For the recent months, I've been deeply interested in the web design aspect since the first touch with <a href="https://webflow.com/">Webflow</a>. Now I know how @roundbeargames feels for his dedication 3D game making and dive deep in the development without looking back. Because I feel the same towards web designing now. Passion delivers the same feeling I guess.

As a computer science graduate, the only relation with the design was my hobby to draw something on the paper/iPad. Never took a relevant artistic course or class before. Had no clue about the colour thesis or any fundamental design concept. Feeling this could be the next thing I should work on. The first thing comes to my mind is the book. Those books full of design concepts written by gurus should be my targets.

Well, I found a great free resource in the process of finding book recommendation. The <a href="https://material.io">material.io</a> by the great Google.

<blockquote>
  Make beautiful products, faster. Material is a design system – backed by open-source code – that helps teams build digital experiences.

</blockquote>

If you are a fan of modern design, material design should sounds familiar. Meterial.io aims to educate every designer what material design is all about, in a material design style. The very site itself is a textbook design model for inspiration already. Every section and page within the domain are so well coordinated that makes the reading process enjoyable and addictive.

I have not yet finished consuming the whole site but this is definitely what I'm going to do in the next few days. You should pay a visit too even for the sake of little web designing sense development.
