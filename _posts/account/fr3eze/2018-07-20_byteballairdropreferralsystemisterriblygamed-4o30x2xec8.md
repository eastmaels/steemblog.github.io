<h2>Byteball airdrop to Steem frenzy</h2>

It is the craziest airdrop event I have ever witnessed on Steem in my 2 years time, simply due to the lucrative airdrop amount and referal reward. Byteball has established theri brand for a while in the crypto space and the coins can easily be cashed out, that is why it was so hot after the announcement. But I would like to talk more about the most lucrative reward for this event, the referal system!

<h2>How lucrative is it?</h2>

The referral gets <strong>exactly the same reward as the new user*'s reward</strong>. A new 70 rep Steemian gets $160 and so do you if they happend to be under your reference.

While is sounds like a totally great idea for promote Byteball as hars as possible, there is some tricks to game the referral system and exploit the reward.

<h2>First, you need to know how the system define the referrer.</h2>

<blockquote>
  <strong>Difficult questions</strong>
  <em>Question: What if a user clicked a referral link and paid with funds sent to him from another attested user?</em>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> The user providing the funds will be the referrer, not the one from the link.

<em>Question: What if there were multiple inputs from several attested users being used to pay for an attestation?</em>
<strong>Answer:</strong> The input that is closest but not less than the output required will be the referrer.

<em>Question: What if the user didn’t spend my funds, but instead signed a message?</em>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Then nobody will be the referrer of that attestation.
</blockquote>

You should read it if you have more intesrest on what was the network issue lately and more information about the airdrop.

<h2>Highly exploitable referral game</h2>

Ultimately, the referral link is practically useless. The decisive factor is <strong>whose fund the new user used for the Steem attestation</strong>.

That's why having the new users commenting their wallet address in the public area is a good way to lose the referral reward for post owner. Because all the reward hunters would just send the minimum fund(about $0.08) to new addresses.

Someone is even creating some bots tapping on Steem API to track Byteball wallet address over all the network and send funds. I heard people are making a few thousands dollar just over a few days. Crazy world.

<strong>TLDR:</strong> Byteball airdrop referral system is highly exploitable.

<strong>太长没读：</strong> Byteball 空降最让人垂涎的就是推荐系统。推荐者可以得到同样比例的奖励，但是缺点就是太容易被摆弄，有很多方式可以把原属于作者的奖励偷去了。<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/byteball-airdrop-referral-system-is-terribly-gamed/</em><hr/></center>
