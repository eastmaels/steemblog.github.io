I always wanted to subscribe to one reliable VPN service as the awareness of digital privacy rising every day, especially joining the crypto space for over a year. <strong>Walking on the Internet unprotected is like walking on the street naked</strong>. I've travel naked online long enough, although VPN alone will not cover my anonymity much at least I will be somewhat protected.

Last Black Friday Sales which was 2 months ago, there were some really nice deals I've heard about for VPN subscription. I was too busy to look at those deals at that moment, NordVPN was one one of the better deals back and I heard good things about that brand in the Reddit community. So I proceeded to find out what is the current offer compared to the last BF sales price, this way I can tell how <em>sincere</em> was the BF deal from this brand as well.

<strong>However, there is no difference.</strong>

<h3>NordVPN</h3>

<h5>What was the Black Friday sales price?</h5>

<blockquote>
  At just <strong>$2.99 per month</strong>, this Black Friday special has you walking away with three years of top-notch internet security for a measly $107.55 total. Talk about an absolute steal. <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/black-friday-2018-nord-vpn-deal/#VCdGBpelnsq6">Source</a>

</blockquote>

<h5>What is the current price?</h5>

<a href="https://nordvpn.com/">Official site</a>

$2.99 per month and $107.55 total for a 3-year deal. Absolutely the same.

<h3>ExpressVPN</h3>

<h5>What was the Black Friday sales price?</h5>

<strong>$6.67/Mo</strong>

<h5>What is the current price?</h5>

<a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/order">Official site</a>

Exactly the same, shame.

<h3>Verdict</h3>

This <a href="https://vpnblackfriday.com/">vpnblackfriday</a> listed all the VPN Black Friday sales and you can simply check out the present price of each brand the chances are <strong>the prices will still be the same.</strong>

In other words, if you wondering what is the best time to hunt for a great deal for your first or next VPN services. The best time is now, <strong>because there are no sales for VPN package even the Black Friday sales was just a gimmick.</strong> <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/vpn-sale-deals-are-fake/ </em><hr/></center>
