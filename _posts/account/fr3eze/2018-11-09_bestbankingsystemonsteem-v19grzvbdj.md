Since the day I invested in some SP 2 years ago when I first join Steem, I've been constantly looking for an investment tool that is going to repay my hard-earned SP in a various way.

There are plenty of ways to fully utilize the one's SP including:

<ul>
<li>Self-voting 10 times a day.</li>
<li>Delegate all the SP to voting bot like @smartsteem.</li>
<li>Selling votes to voting bot</li>
</ul>

I definitely not interested in the first one. Yet I don't like the idea of giving away all my stake to a bot just for the sake of income. Maybe I will do that the day when I decided not to stay active here.

<h2>@justyy's YY Bank system turns out to be the best I've ever tried.</h2>

I started out my Steem journey in the CN community and @justyy was the big shot in the circle. He started the <strong>YY Bank</strong> initially for the sake of CN community as we were quite small compared to the others. I first joined with a delegation of 100 SP as the project aims to support my fellow friends in the same circle.

It works like some sort of voting bots while <strong>giving out daily interest</strong> even investors stay inactive on the platform, just like what a bank does. Read more about it <a href="https://github.com/DoctorLai/steemit-wechat-group">here</a>.

I've been trying out a several <em>investment tools</em> like the above-mentioned voting bots, @xiguang, @steem-ua, just to name a few.

I'm not going to do the math here as I did not bother to do a detailed experiment or comparison but <strong>YY Bank just clearly won in the battle</strong> in term of investment return.

<h2>Collecting my delegation back and put it all to the YY Bank</h2>

I still want to hold most of my SP and I usually delegated out 20% of my power which is at the acceptable level.

I guess the YY Bank is not limited to the CN community anymore but you can always check with the bank owner @justyy or check out his post footer in every post for more detail. Give him the same amount of delegation that you gave to your favourite investment tool and compare the result.

You will be surprised.<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/best-banking-system-on-steem/</em><hr/></center>
