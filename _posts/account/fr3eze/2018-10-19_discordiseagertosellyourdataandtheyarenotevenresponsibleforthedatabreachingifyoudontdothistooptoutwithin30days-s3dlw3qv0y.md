Discord have their Terms of Service changed to revoke the user's right to sue them for selling customer's data. Without the ability to gather for a class action lawsuit, <strong>if</strong> Discord decided to leak your data to any third parties for whatever purpose. Your stance in seeking justice for such wrong-doing is weak if not almost impossible as an average user.

<h2>But you have 30 days to opt-out from the disgusting arbitration clause</h2>

Read the great post with detail inside on this post:

https://gist.github.com/0x263b/54a37d0f0ba1d65dd59b9a4dfee9ff31#gistcomment-2735914

Basically, you just need to send an email to <code>arbitration-opt-out@discord.com</code> with sufficient identity information in order to make a clear opt-out from <em>silently agreeing to sell own data away</em>. The email template suggesting in the post should be perfect for this case:


`To whom it may concern,`

`Please be advised that I do not consent to the Arbitration Section of the updated Discord Terms of Service, and I also do not waive my right to resolve disputes on behalf of, or as part of, a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. I recognize that Discord will not be bound by the provisions of the Arbitration Section. My username is username, and the email address associated with my account is email@address.com. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.`

`Sincerely,`

`Your IRL Name`
`Your Username (with #)`
`Your Discord ID`
`Email Associated With Account`
`(Optional) Phone Number Associated With Account`

<h2>Think twice if you are about to share sensitive data in Discord</h2>

Apparently, Discord is one of the brightest stars in crypto space and it seems like every project must have a Discord channel else to <strong>follow the industry standard</strong>. While it is not designed for privacy chatting purpose, such an obvious intention to sell user's data away raises a big red flag to continue to rely most of my average communication on the channels.

Sent the opt-out email, grab some popcorn, and keeping an eye on how long does it take for the public to find out Discord's major data breach in the short future.
