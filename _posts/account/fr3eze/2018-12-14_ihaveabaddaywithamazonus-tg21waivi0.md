This is a sad day to find out my first and only Amazon account has been closed down due to some silly reasons.

Occasionally, I did some purchase in Amazon US and ship them over to Singapore. I hooked some really good deals as the same items would cost a lot more on the local market and with the top-notch customer support, I always regard the Amazon one of the must-know hacks for online shoppers. Owning a Kindle a few years ago just made me sticks more to the Amazon ecosystem because it is so comfortable operating within the system.

<h2>My sweet journey with Amazon has ended due to a silly transaction</h2>

So back to a few months back Amazon decided to support the SG market and make the Amazon E-commerce site available here although with a way smaller inventory. I found a great deal on GPU that I couldn't find it cheaper elsewhere. Proceeded to make the payment after checkout. It was successful, expect the transaction bounced after half an hour. Tried a few more time, no luck.

To make thing worse, Amazon system suspended my account as it suspected some hackers were trying something funny. While it was actually me myself dealing with the stupid system with my own account.

<h2>The account remained suspended for a few months</h2>

I have had enough as I getting active with my Kindle again and would like to buy more books. Contacted the customer support a few times which requires a logged in status to start with, while my issue was exactly with the login(stupid design, again). By all means, I had to use a secondary account to initiate the chat and contact.

Anyway, the best answer Amazon could give me was to shut down the account and ask me to create another one if I would like to shop again.

So I have to use a new email address to sign up a new account(stupid, again!), my transaction history is gone, and most importantly, my Kindle book collection gone as well. Fortunately, I did not have much invested in the books.

This is exactly the downside of a centralised service. Bad day. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/i-have-a-bad-day-with-amazon-us/ </em><hr/></center>
