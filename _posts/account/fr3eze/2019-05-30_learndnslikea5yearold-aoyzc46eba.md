It turns out the new job requires deep understanding on how the DNS works. I have a barely shallow idea on it and trying so hard in finding useful resource online to top up some practical knowledge. The first one is really a great example of showcase how to "Explain like I'm 5"(ELI5) on any subject, even a very technical one like DNS. <a href="https://howdns.works/ep1/">How DNS Works</a> illustrates possibly the full process of DNS lookup via a series of lightly animated comic. Super interesting! And if you need more depth in that topic, <a href="http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/">DNS for Rocket Scientists</a> is another great resource to consume. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/learn-dns-like-a-5-year-old/ </em><hr/></center>
