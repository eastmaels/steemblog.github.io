Steemit has become my most visited sites, getting rid of Facebook is easy for me as I already regard that was the most time-wasting stuff of my life. But I still regularly visit YouTube for there are still some interesting channels that I cannot live without. For example the NBA and Vox channel. These are the big brands and won't be easy to land their foot in a new place like Steemit. However, I also subscribed an interesting yet educational personal channel, namely [Marcello Barenghi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcBnT6LsxANZjUWqpjR8Jpw). 

**Marcello Barenghi** is an Italian artist who also known as "the best artist in the world" by most of his fans. By using tools like airbrush, acrylics, pencil, markers and much more, he can recreate a hyper-realistic art on a paper or canvas. Let's enjoy some of his masterpieces.

<center>All images and video are taken from the artist personal site: http://www.marcellobarenghi.com/, feel free to pay him a visit.</center>

I thought that would be a great idea to introduce Steemit to Mr. Marcello Barenghi. If he ever agrees to give it a try, there are a couple of advantages for us all:

- I can enjoy his art creating process right here on Steemit.
- I can pay my respect by upvoting so that he can earn real money while the YouTube's like gives him nothing at all.
- He can broaden his fan base here 
- He can earn direct reward without advertisement and commissions.
- No extra work for him as he already shares the same things anyway on the other social sites.

All I did was just sending him an email with the content below. I briefly explain how Steemit can benefit his artist career at the same time use my artwork's reward for example.

I will start approaching my favorite channels or blog authors using personal contact like this. Though this is way less efficient than what @jerrybanfield does in advertising Steemit in large scale as his witness service, I find a way to add value to this amazing society too. Hope I can score one success or two by doing so, it is going to be a win-win.

Steemit 已经成了我花时间最多的网站之一，抛弃脸书对我来说还是轻而易举的，因为很早之前就发觉这类社交软件最是浪费时间而不带来任何好处。但很多时候还是会上别的网站来关注有趣的信息，因为在 Steemit 里找不到。其中之一就是 YouTube 里大名鼎鼎的 [Marcello Barenghi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcBnT6LsxANZjUWqpjR8Jpw). 

**Marcello Barenghi** 是位意大利籍艺术家，粉丝们都称他为*世上最好的画家*。在 YouTube 上有过百万的订阅量。他主要的作品风格是高度写实主义，画出来的物件都是活灵活现，仿佛是立体的一般。上面可以看到他的舒张作品，有兴趣的话可以到他的官网朝圣：<http://www.marcellobarenghi.com/>

如果能够把如此的超巨画家带来 Steemit，好处有：

- 我可以在这里就观赏到他的大作，不用分心上 YouTube。
- 我可以直接用投票带给他实际的金钱收益。YouTube 上的赞可没什么用。
- 他可以扩展自己的粉丝群。
- 他可以有额外的直接金钱收入，没有中介没有抽成。
- 他几乎不需要做多余的功夫，因为只需把分享在其他网站上的功夫在这里再做一次就好。

我寄了一封电子邮件到他的个人信箱，内容请看上面的英文版本。我简单的介绍了加入 Steemit 会给他带来的好处，同时也用我的绘画帖来作为例子，把赤裸裸的收入摆在他眼前，完全贯彻 Money Talks 的理念。希望可以吸引到他吧。

今天开始我会陆续对我关注的内容作家安利 Steemit 这个平台。当然相对 @jerrybanfield 的 Steemit 广告服务而言我这个是小巫见大巫的。怎样都好，我总是为平台贡献一份棉力了。
