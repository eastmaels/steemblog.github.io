There is a superstitious belief among the Chinese that one shall not praises for the good as the good might be ended very soon afterwards. Made a post about the god-blessed nice weather in Macau last night and it turns out we have a rainy day the whole next day. It rains the fuxking WHOLE day.

Our plan and schedule was all screwed up as all the attraction places were mostly outdoors. No choice but we have to spend our day in the Casino marathon around famous casinos like Venetian, Parisian and the Studio City.

Oh ya, the raining day here sounds like the best theme for our dear crypto market today. All-time-low for the whole market cap in 2018 sitting at 120B and we are probably looking at our Steem wallet worth the least we've ever seen too.

Attached a mini Eiffel tower from the Parision Macau, the saddening rainy day, as an ending.
