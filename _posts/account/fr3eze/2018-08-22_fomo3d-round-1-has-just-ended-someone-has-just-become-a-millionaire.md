Here is the withdrawal transaction of the 10k ETH winner:

https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe08a519c03cb0aed0e04b33104112d65fa1d3a48cd3aeab65f047b2abce9d508

Not sure how he did it but he is the final winner of the very infamous FOMO games that had been running for multiple weeks. Congratulation to that lucky bastard with that 2 million dollar worth of jackpot!

As for P3D holder, there is no obvious spike in the dividend yet not sure if it is due to system lagging or the Bear team just won the FOMO3D jackpot. It's likely to be the latter case I believe. At the point of writing this article,  the FOMO Round 2 is still at the 1 hour grace period before starting. In other words, all the key are valued at the same price(@ 0.00007500 ETH) no matter how many one is buying. I bought a little to try how the FOMO Long is working but it seems like the [website](https://exitscam.me/play) is not responsive enough to reflect the true information. 

At the same time, it could be another good opportunities to get some [P3D](https://powh.io/?masternode=0x6e02e12a3458c82d5ae51d1492e8bca14e1532a7) now because all the key buying from FOMO would pay P3D holders in term of dividend. As I can see, the [FDMO3D address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa62142888aba8370742be823c1782d17a0389da1) already accumulated about 11k ETH in the grace period. 

Damn, men are greedy!

为期数个星期的 FOMO3D 终于在今天毫无预警的完结了，幸运儿赢得了 10,000 的 ETH，在[这里](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe08a519c03cb0aed0e04b33104112d65fa1d3a48cd3aeab65f047b2abce9d508) 是他提款的 Hash，一夜暴富啊！可惜的是似乎赢家选的是熊队，所以母币 P3D 持有者并没有得到最终奖金的分红。没关系不是还有 Round 2 吗？

话说，现在可是入手 [P3D](https://powh.io/?masternode=0x6e02e12a3458c82d5ae51d1492e8bca14e1532a7) 的好时机啊。看看 [FDMO3D 的地址](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa62142888aba8370742be823c1782d17a0389da1) 在目前已经有 11 千 ETH 为下一轮进行注资，对 P3D 玩家来说可是不少的红利啊！
