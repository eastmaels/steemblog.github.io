Recently, I was in a raging mode clearing up my inbox that full with unread emails which are likely to be remained unread for the rest of my time. Unsubscribing all the promotional or news related emails or pull them into the spam filter if I have to do it for the second time on the same sender. Even nutritious reading feed like Medium and Quora was one of the victims in my clearing list. Too less time while too many to read.

Spotify sent me an email and I naturally open it and start looking for the *Unsubscribe* button at the bottom, except the striking heading got my attention: [Your 2018 in music: find out how you listened](https://spotifywrapped.com/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=wrapped&utm_campaign=2018q4_markets_single_cproductmarketing_holiday). Awesome presentation although some of the stats are not as accurate.

<center>So [如烟](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd9YGu3FWgc) by Mayday was the first song I played this year huh? Cool.</center>

<center>This stat surprise me very much, maybe I keep exploring some random background music for study/working/sleeping occasionally.</center>

<center>Alright, I love Eason. Could not help but keep looping his songs and keep digging down his past works for more. Definitely the next singer who I'm going to attend his concert. Hopefully, we can do it in his own country, HK.</center>

<center>I spent this much minutes in Spotify? 234326 minutes = 3905.43 hours = 162.73 days. I was listening to music for about half the year? I called this an awesome investment in Spotify premium subscription.</center>
