Days ago my desktop used a very saddening way to welcome me home from work, by showing me the PCIE network card has been dead all of a sudden. Due to the network card was my sole input of the network connection, I was immediately doomed to a very emotional state while realizing I'm going spend a night with the PC without internet connection(I'm a huge internet addict, but who aren't?)

Got me a spare wifi dongle the very next day hence the <a href="https://steemit.com/network/@fr3eze/awifisaviourinmyroom-ahvqw7xdol">speedtest post</a> the other day with the new router and WiFi.

But nothing beats a PCIE network card with LAN connection on a desktop PC. My <strong>TP-LINK Gigabit PCI Express Network Adapter TG-3468</strong> has finally arrived 5 days after putting the order in Lazada(Shipping speed in SG sucks big time).

The single LAN port is all I wanted and needed. This piece of card also comes with 3 years of local warranty so I probably don't have to suffer from the heart attack of a card sudden death again.

This is a random speedtest right after the installation of the card. It was previously at 30 Mbps with WiFi connection. I can die peacefully now.
