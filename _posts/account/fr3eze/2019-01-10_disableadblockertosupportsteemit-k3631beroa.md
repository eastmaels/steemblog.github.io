Since Steemit puts up advertisement on the trending and hot page, I figured this could be a great and straightforward way to support the company by disabling the ad-blockers in my browser. By viewing and clicking the advertisement this could bring another handsome of income stream to STINC if most of the Steemian do the same.

<h2>But is it worth it?</h2>

One must acknowledge the fact that <strong>STINC doesn't equal to STEEM</strong>. It is just a Dapp on top of STEEM. Out of the outrages love to the Steem blockchain, one might supports whatever decision has been made by the largest stake holder of the space but that's not how a decentralised community works. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/disable-ad-blocker-to-support-steemit/ </em><hr/></center>
