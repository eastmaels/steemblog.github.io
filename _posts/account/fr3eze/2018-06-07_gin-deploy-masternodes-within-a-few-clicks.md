## Hunter's comment
Running a masternode is not only help to secure the network but it is also a cool way of investment. However, setting one up could be a real pain without deep technical knowledge in Linux or wallet management. **GIN** aims to provide the turnkey solution for investors to set up their masternodes without technical abilities.

The normal manual way of starting a masternode is usually as follows: Rent a VPS server, download a wallet, purchase the particular project's coin, build and install masternode programs on the server. Not to mention the miscellaneous works like troubleshooting server's network issue, maintenance job like make sure disk space is always sufficient. Even a seasoned technical investor will be annoyed as all the setup methods could be different for various projects.

GIN is a game changer in this field as it provides a [platform](https://p.gincoin.io/) to **deploy the supported masternodes within a few clicks.**

This is the part of the supported coins which users can deploy their new node via simple and beautiful user interface instead of the scary command lines, more blockchain projects are continuously added. Check out the [supported list](https://p.gincoin.io/) to see if your favourite projects are listed there.

Another advantage is GIN provide a comprehensive **Masternode setup & administration UI** which users can control everything in a one-stop station. Who are running multiple masternodes at the same time manually knows the pain when it comes to administration work.
