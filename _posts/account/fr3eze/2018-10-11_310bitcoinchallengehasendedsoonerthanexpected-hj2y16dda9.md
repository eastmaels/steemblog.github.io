Not long after I wrote about the interesting <a href="https://steemit.com/computer/@fr3eze/collaborativeonasinglemaphasneverbeeneasierwithgooglemaps-s8rqkt6set">310 Bitcoinchallenge</a> which I expected to be solved not within a short time frame as a total cryptography novice, the fund was drained around this morning. <strong>Someone cracked the puzzle and became an overnight millionaire!</strong>

The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9kq7it/introducing_the_310_btc_bitcoin_challenge/?utm_source=reddit-android">original Reddit thread</a> had the owner and some interested folks discussed about it. It appears to be out of the owner expectation that the biggest pot would be cracked in such a quick manner.

<h2>Don't be dissapointed</h2>

If you just feel like missing something important in your life to work on, this puzzle owner said that **he was amazed by the community effort shown in this experiment and would likely to come out with another puzzle with improved complexity!

In fact, if you are new to such puzzle solving game, this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nUAhlC_n21ZLZcRAHpLw9G--gpk4NUVIJqVp9F68qp4/edit">link</a> would be a great source to start with. It consist of some solutions for other minors puzzles which is included in the same picture.

Take a good read of it and try to grep as much logic as possible out of the owner's logic, who knows you could be the next puzzle solver and win millions away!<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/310-bitcoin-challenge-has-ended-sooner-than-expected/</em><hr/></center>
