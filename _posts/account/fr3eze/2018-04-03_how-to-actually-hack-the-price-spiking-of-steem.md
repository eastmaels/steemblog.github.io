The only great news to all the people on Steem today is that sudden surge of Steem for 50%, spiking from $1.5 all the way to $2.2. The reason was unknown as no one could ever link correctly the price trend to any crypto events. Some said it was due to the [awesome update of Hivemind](/steem/@steemitblog/update-communities-hivemind), some said this is a usual bounce after such a hard crash. None of it matters in fact, the question we all should care about is,

## How can we benefit from this price spiking?

Yes we can, and it could be as much as the increment of Steem price we see today.

To understand how this trick works we first have to understand how is Steem blockchain calculating the actual feed price. It is not based on the current market price but **using the average price of last 3.5 days.**

You can simply calculate the `feed_price` by `Steem Power/Estimated Account Value`, or make use of the [SteemTools](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@justyy/steemtools-update-adding-account-witness-data-option-to-save-key-and-bug-fixes) developed by @justyy.

As of now, the feed price is $1.5, let's say Steem will maintain at $2 for the next 3.5 days. This feed price will slowly increase to $2 after one week. 

## So what does this mean?

Our post payout solely depends on the `feed_price` as well. Still couldn't get it? 

**Gather all the votes you can from vote-selling site like [SmartSteem](https://smartsteem.com?r=fr3eze) on your recent post.** Sit back and chill while watching the value of the post growing.

You can buy votes from other [bots](https://steembottracker.com/) but make sure to choose those with positive ROI. 

For example, if you are able to get $10 of votes today while the `feed_price` is $1.5. **After half a week your post will be valued 33% more at $13.33** as `feed_price` catch up to $2.

## Of course everything comes with risks

Here are the few assumptions that must happen for this trick to work:

- Steem market price has to be maintained at least higher than $1.5 level.
- Vote buying ROI cannot be negative or else it would eat up the profit.

This trick works best if you already have Steem and SBD on hand to spend. Even if you decided to buy some hot Steem for the post-pumping, it doesn't hurt much as a true Steem believer for this trick to fail because you just adding more power to the investing position!

今天的 Steem 狂飙车想必大家已经知晓，确实的原因也没人能说得上来。但没关系，毕竟上来就已经是好事。真正应该问的问题是，我们能从这一波猛涨里额外获益吗？

### 可以的！

前提是你要知道 Steem 体系如何计算 `feed_price`, 那就是使用最近 3.5 天的平均价。而我们的帖子收入也是根据这个喂价上下波动，目前尽管市价已经升到 $2，但是均价还是在 $1.5 左右。

### 什么？还是 get 不到？

**你要做的就是极尽所能的集合所有的赞，比如从 [SmartSteem](https://smartsteem.com?r=fr3eze) 那里买赞给自己最新的帖子。然后就坐等看着帖子收益慢慢上升吧。** 以今天的均价买赞，要是 3.5 天以后市价都可以维持在 $2 ，帖子收益就会上升 33%！今天价值 $10 的帖子半个星期后会变成 $13.33 哦！

### 当然没有什么事稳赚不赔的

这个旁门左道要生效的话有两大前提：Steem 市价在未来 3.5 天起码要高于 $1.5, 和你获得赞的回报率不可为负数。

当然这旁门左道就算失败了，对真正在 Steem 有信仰的人来说也没什么，就当作是一次低价买入咯！
