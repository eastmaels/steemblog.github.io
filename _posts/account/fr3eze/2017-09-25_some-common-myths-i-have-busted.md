纵观身边的任何事物，发现一些有趣的现象。那就是人往往对某件事有些不正确的理解，而形成种种不切实际的期望。

### 抱着赚钱的心态去赌场赌钱

首先，赌场是一个商业的存在。各种你能玩上的游戏都是经过了各种专家无数精算推敲出来的成品。短时间内的确是可能赢钱的。但要是时间拉长了，局数累积的够了，游戏规则所赋予庄家的绝对优势将慢慢显现。这并非迷信，而是绝对的科学。大多数有十年以上‘资历’的赌徒的收益都是负数的。认清这点你就不会再有“干翻赌场”的幼稚想法了。

我觉得正确的做法是抱着娱乐的心情去赌，要有胜负心但别当赢钱是必须的。譬如21点，解读庄家牌数，分析敌我优劣势，从而加注弃注，这种种过程都是刺激而有趣的.毕竟赌场是标榜“娱乐机构”的一种，而不是金融投资。抱着轻松的态度，赢钱固然皆大欢喜，输了也是预料之中。岂不好？

### 看鬼戏不想被吓

“我不付钱来吓自己。” 相信大家身边都有一些不看鬼片的朋友，这句话是我从他们身上听到重复最多的。作为惊悚类的鬼片的目的是什么？就是吓观众。你看喜剧片，就是期望可以被逗笑，开开心心。看悬疑片，就是期望随着剧情的发展，可以和主角一起当侦探，揭开种种谜团。看动作片，希望可以看到拳拳到肉刺激非常的打斗，让人肾上激素爆发的那种爽快。看鬼片你不想被吓到，难道希望像看笑片般整场下来笑个不停？

我爱看鬼片。我买票进场能被一些好的桥段吓到脸青青，是这套惊悚片做到了惊悚，对我来说这就是好戏，值回票价！

### Steemit会让我发达

很明显的看到那些大鲸鱼每篇帖子都有上百元的收入的确是让刚加入的我羡慕不已，再对比自己苦心创造数个小时却只收获寥寥无几的回应，实在是让人心寒。也曾一度让我失去动力。原来自己加入Steemit的目标除了赚钱还是赚钱，这不是个正确的期望。

到后来调整心态，[发现这里带来的价值远远不止于赚钱](https://steemit.com/steemit/@fr3eze/steemit-give-me-a-reason-to-write-every-day)，还有锻炼创意的思维，作为生活笔记，养成固定写作的好习惯，提升写作技巧等等。心态平衡了，也更有动力继续写下去了。

**认清一切事情的本质能让人拥有正确的期望，从而减少不必要的失望或观念。**

I've noticed some interesting phenomena around me that is the unmatched of expectation and reality can lead to many incorrect values and disappointment.

### Expect to win from a casino

First of all, the casino is a big business. All the games you can find inside were the result of actuarial science by a bunch of mathematicians. Given sufficient amount of rounds, most players are going to join the losing site thanks to the statistic which granted advantages to the home. You can win in short term but not long term. Acknowledge this fact and you will stop to fantasize bringing out piles of cash from a casino.  

The right way to enjoy in a casino is equipping the "have fun" mindset. You can long to win but don't take winning as granted. There are a lot of fun in the process too. Take the Blackjack as an example, we can have fun by analyzing the edge of each hand, apply different strategies to maximize our advantage or to fold or split the cards. After all, the casino is a business of entertainment, of course winning is good but losing is expected as well.

### Do not want to be frightened by a Horror movie

"I don't pay to scare myself, bro." We all have such friends who don't enjoy the horror movie and that is the sentence I heard the most from them. What is the ultimate goal of a horror movie? To frighten the audience. We expect the laughter when we watch the comedy. Expect to go into the detective mode and reasoning with the characters in the mystery film. For the action movie, we love the adrenaline rush by the fierce fighting. And what do you expect watching the horror film if not to get frightened? Laughing the whole 2 hours just like you were watching the comedy? 

I love horror films. I enjoy to be frightened by a well-planned plot and that is how I decide if the ticket is worthwhile.

### Steemit is going to make me rich

I believe this the biggest myth in Steemit yet many will fall for it, I wasn't an exception. It was really bitterly disappointing to see the others earn hundreds easily every post while your 4-hour-worth of the article just sink to the bottom of the sea. And soon I realized my motivation was all about money, which is not appropriate at all. 

There are bunches of advantages we can develop using a platform like Steemit. [Training the idea muscle](https://steemit.com/steemit/@fr3eze/steemit-give-me-a-reason-to-write-every-day), improving writing skills, keeping a personal journal, and so on. When I found the balance between expectation and rewards, the motivation becomes natural again.
