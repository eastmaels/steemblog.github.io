I've been playing EOSKnight for months and while it sound like a lot, the actual time spending on the game was decreasing readily as I stopped upgrading the equipment for the knights(the only way to go to higher floor for better loots). The <em>gaming</em> part in a day was just about log in the every 3 or 4 hours and tap the Rebirth button for the knights to auto-fight til their death.

The leftmost Ancient class material <strong>Golden Bloodium</strong> is by far the most valuable item I've ever looted which was successfully sold for <strong>7 EOS</strong>. The economy of trading market is falling fast, the same class of items is not worth that much anymore. Judging from the market trending, I guess there are 2 lessons I've learnt if the purpose of gaming is to profit:

<ul>
<li><strong>Top your knight as soon as the game starts</strong> so you get higher chance to get better loot than others, which means you can sell the items/materials for higher price.</li>
<li><strong>Sell items/materials as soon as possible</strong> instead of saving them up and speculate for future higher price.</li>
