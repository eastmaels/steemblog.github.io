Saw this interesting picture from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ahubtj/bitcoin_yearly_lows_interesting/">Reddit</a>. It definitely has more the shilling sense in the than to bash it. Looking at the ATH is depressing because we are going on the downhill, but ATL(all-time-low) might give you another perspective on how crypto is performing over the course.

One of the obvious messages that this picture is that <strong>Bitcoin is getting a stronger base every year</strong>. And more importantly, it hints the readers that <strong>the only direction Bitcoin heading is only UP</strong>. Well, sometimes it is amazing to find out how the crypto community can figure their way out to make thing looks optimistic no matter how bad the market is.

I'm not a Bitcoin maximalist, but I can interpret this graph looks exactly the same as Bitcoin price in the same period of time, and we all know what happened after the ATH. Will this picture hold true for in the coming years or the downturn just ahead of us? <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/a-slight-dose-of-bitcoin-shilling/ </em><hr/></center>
