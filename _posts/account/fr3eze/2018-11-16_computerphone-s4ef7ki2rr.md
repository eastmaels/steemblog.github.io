I didn't spend a lot of time to find out that I'm a deep computer-guy. Without being said that I'm a computer scientist at all, I'm just value the PC/computer/desktop more than all the fancy portable mobile devices like tablets and phones.

I remember back then when my brother and I was sharing a rented room in Singapore, we often spending out night leisure time on electronic devices. Me on the performance laptop which I just bought not long ago with the credit-card-based loan, my brother was happily dealing with his iPad. And it is his only bigger device other than a smartphone. How can one survive a life without a fully functioning computer? This is the unanswered question till today.

<h2>Why I put computer above all the mobile devices?</h2>

All in all, the most obvious argument that mobile devices still not capable of doing what a proper desktop OS could do. For example:

<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile devices cannot torrenting/seeding</strong> which was a huge part of my online activity a few years back. Maybe some geeks might argue this point and I believe through some hard work it is still possible to torrent on a tablet/phone but that's just too much of a hassle.</li>
<li>Mobile devices smaller screen is <strong>making them not the best tool for long-hours work</strong>. I'm not a fan of switching different poses while typing a blog due to soreness.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop computer is the best productivity tool. Period.</strong> Bigger screen, tons of tools that specially designed to work better with desktop mode(like my recent favourite web application <a href="https://webflow.com/">Webflow</a>), tons of connectivity, tons of fun.</li>
</ul>

And the last point above could be the biggest reason why I rather spend my time and money on a fully capable machine than those fancy and expensive tablet/phone. Speaking of being frugal on phone investment, my current phone has been spending the longest time with me than any other pre-owned phone -- 2 years and still counting! I'm proud of myself, damn. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/computer-phone/ </em><hr/></center>
