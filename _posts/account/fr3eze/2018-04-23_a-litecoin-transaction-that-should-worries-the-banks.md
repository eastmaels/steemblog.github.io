Today the biggest fun news in crypto was about a [Litecoin transaction](https://amp.businessinsider.com/a-99-million-litecoin-trade-took-just-25-minutes-and-cost-040-2018-4?__twitter_impression=true). Long story short,  someone made a one-off 700,000 Litecoin ($99m USD) for a fee of 0.00284289 LTC (0.4 USD), within 3 minutes. [See](https://bitinfocharts.com/litecoin/address/LZYCpYnV8VE4X7TbH8jjuvYPMfAugGLNAs) for yourselves.

I can imagine how annoying and irritating this might sound to bankers. At the least 3% handling/admin/processing fee, this transaction alone will incur a fee of 30,000 USD. Bankers or money transfer service providers just lost the profit equivalent to a house down-payment. Even if they promise to offer a huge discount on the fee, how long will it need to be processed? More than 3 minutes if not for 3 days.

**I don't even feel like mentioning that Steem could do that amount of transaction for free within 3 seconds.**

I can't help but list the troubles one is going to face doing such a huge transaction with the banks.

- Some authorities will be triggered and you will have to prove the legitimacy of the money.
- You might be under government surveillance ever since.
- Tons of paperwork awaits you to complete for the processing.
- Transfering or receiving bank entities might go away or preventing you from accessing your money for whatsoever reason.
- Losing a brand new car by paying the ridiculous fee.
- Anxiety for a few days(if not weeks) while waiting for the transaction to complete.

Banksters should be seriously worried by this fun news.
