Serving my first proper resignation period from a professional job gives me a rather complicated feeling, mostly positive obviously. While not hating the job and the environment, I always had a dream not having to work or giving zero shits about executing orders from bosses. Although I'm not even close to that dream, quitting a job while already secured the next job gave me that kind of feeling I always wanted.

I'm still reporting to work every day, for handing over my stuff to the colleagues and get the remaining jobs done. Deep inside me, I've already given much less care about all this chore. I can slack all the way through the notice period but the professionalism in me just don't let me. Carrying out the duty knowing that I <em>have options</em> is probably one of the most wonderful feelings in the world. <strong>I'm my own boss now.</strong>

Well, I'm well aware of the strong sense of security comes 100% from the fact that I've landed on the next job. Soon the <em>honeymoon</em> will pass, and someone else will be my boss again. I will keep working on making my self the one true boss. So does everyone. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/working-like-a-boss-temporarily/ </em><hr/></center>
