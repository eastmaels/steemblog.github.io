>This series is to record my SmartNode journey. This is very much high risk experimental act and I'm prepared to lose all the fund invested. Do your own research as this is not a financial advice.

# Buy SMART

SMART is very thinly traded now with limited exchanges which can find in this [page](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/smartcash/#markets). HitBTC and CryptoBridge will be the main choices. The former is having higher trading volume overall so I registered a new account and bought the SMART there. 

One good thing about HitBTC is the user-friendliness that users do not need to do BS actions like KYC or taking a stupid photo. It is just plugs and plays.

As a SmartNode requires `10,000 SMART`, I bought 10,100 SMART with the extra 100 just in case it will be needed for any transaction fee.

The price was around `0.0000119 BTC` with a total cost of `0.1202 BTC` which is equivalent to `1,137.64 USD` as of now. Should be quite a good deal considering it has just dropped 12% today. This coin has been readily declining over a month, not sure what is actually happening behind the scene but I see no big deal-breaker bad news upon my research. 

Furthermore, it is truly a pleasure to buy something that you have a high hope on with cheaper price. So I have a better appetite to buy things in red, guess I'm slowing getting away from the FOMO guild, which is good!
