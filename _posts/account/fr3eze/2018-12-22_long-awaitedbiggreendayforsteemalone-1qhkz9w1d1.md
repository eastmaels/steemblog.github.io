Every time when I see any random coin outperform the overall market trend on a particular day, I used to check out their social media to find out what was the good news. Today our dear Steem had a big surge that was close to 20% and pulled the price back to a nice $0.33.

And I have no idea what was the exact reason what is the cause for this to happen despite Steem is my most participated crypto space. Anyone mind to share?

By the way,  the current market price $0.33 made the wronged internal feed price $0.39 as you can see in <a href="https://steemd.com/">steemd</a>, less wrong, I expected a quick drop to below $0.30 level in the short future though. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/long-awaited-big-green-day-for-steem-alone/ </em><hr/></center>
