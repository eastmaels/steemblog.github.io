The old chinese proverbs sums up pretty well to the latest SteemBet launching, "there is zero harm caused without the comparison". After a few days of counting down to <em>tease</em> the potential clients, the launch of the offcial dice site is rather dissapointing.

Bet takes abnormally long to be completed. No provably fair mechanism found in the website and users have no idea how the random dice number is generated. The worst part is, it utilizes the Keychain browser extension but did not implement the user verification at all upon login, in other words, one can log in as any username.

To maximize the ugliness of this design, SteemBet implemented a live chatting system. I was on the site for less than 1 hour and seeing various weird conversation going on like @ned is promising a 10m SP delegation to the project, @magicdice is announcing to shut down their own service to make place for SteemBet. OK, I have to confess that it was me.

There are worse conversation going on for next couple of hours before SteemBet decided to shut off the disastrous chat system, which should have be done in the beginning. In short, SteemBet is so half-baked especially compared to the rather professional MagicDice. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/a-rather-half-baked-dice-game-on-steem/ </em><hr/></center>
