### Warning: There is no turning back after using this product!

Ever watching the low FPS(frame-per-second) video clips or movie that the jitterness hurt your eyes so much? Ever wonder why the live sport game streaming can feel so smooth? **The answer is, the FPS matters!**

Most of the video footage out there including big title films are made in 20~30 FPS, 24 FPS is the famous setting. And **[60 FPS is the optimal frame rate for human eye](https://gizmodo.com/why-frame-rate-matters-1675153198)**.

**SmoothVideo Project(SVP) makes all the video to 60 FPS (or even higher)**. There is no better tool for movie lovers than the SVP:

- Video smoothening is performed in real-time. No pre-processing and waiting time.
- Runs in any OS: Windows, Linux, macOS.
- Runs in any major video players. I'm using PotPlayer and it works great!
- Supports any source like YouTube and Twitch(yet to test if Dlive/Dtube is supported)

To see is to believe, video says all the words! Remember to set the quality to `1090p60` before playing.

> "3D shows you a window into reality; the higher frame rate takes the glass out of the window" - James Cameron

Videos above are the result of being smoothen by SVP to 60fps. Real life movie or anime, all can be tune to the silky smooth 60 fps! You can try out the SVP free version before going to the full-featured SVP Pro for one-time $24.99. Tips: PotPlayer works well with the free plugin.
