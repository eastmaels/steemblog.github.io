For a long time I have not paid attention to the crypto market, it is great to be notified by some friends lately that the market has shown some bull signs. It was a famous saying that the January is a bad month for crypto as it would usually crash due to the Chinese New Year, and the market will get back on the up-going trend soon thereafter.

Well, we had the longest Chinese New Year starting from January 2018, this is just another myth busted.

Two days left for the CNY 2019 to end completely , I'm glad the market has show that very sign at this moment if we are still talking in the tone of that myth.
