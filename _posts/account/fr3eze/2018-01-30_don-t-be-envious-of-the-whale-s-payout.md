The easiest thing to do in order to quit doing something is simple, just compare your current return with those giants in the same field.

The first advice I gave to friends who are going to start their journey in Steem is to **ignore the money**. I know I used money as the main point to sell the idea of Steem to them, but they really have to ignore the return part in the beginning phase. I've been there. I know being a total plankton you will get way less payout than you expected no matter how much effort you've put in that article. And comparing the money to the whale's post could be the last straw to give up Steem forever.

## But are you even in the position to start the comparison?

We often envy of the tremendous wealth that people made with the early investment of Bitcoin. The fact is, they deserve the handsome return for every reason. They spent time to detect the presence of Bitcoin and put effort into studying it, while you were partying hard in the clubs. They dared to risk their capital to something that everyone sneered at, while you thought "*better play safe with the bank's fixed deposit*'. They have the determination to hold it through several crashes, while you were cheering that you didn't step into that *obvious trap*.

And they got the biggest smile at the end than most of us.

Same applies to the world of Steem. Stop staring at the whale's payout with the greened eye. If you have to, I would suggest that you spend some time to dig out their earliest posts, bet they did worse than what you've achieved now. Most of the *new generation* joined Steem in the flowering season, witnessed it raised from $1 to $6. But would you stay if the all-time-high price of $3.5 has dropped to just $0.15? Those whales did. They deserve every bit of their reward now.

## So stop comparing and start focus on our own instead.

Start putting the focus on something you can control rather than complaining other's payout. Believe me, you have more problems to deal with on this platform. Is your article typesetting good enough for a comfortable reading? Do you know how to set an attractive title? What is the most effective way to promote your posts? How can you do more to contribute to the community?

Envy will bring you nowhere but stuck on the same ground. When people were busy grumping at missing the **2009 Bitcoin lottery**, some wise people who keep their eyes opened found the **STEEM gem** in 2016.

Move on!
