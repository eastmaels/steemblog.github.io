Maybe Macboook Pro is, but definitely no the Air version. Going back hometown for a long Chinese New Year holiday, this new toy MacBook Air 13 2018 is the computer that I'm going to rely on for more than a week. Although I bought it for productivity works which it handles pretty well like coding and internet browsing, I still would like to check out how it performs on my daily casual game.

I've been on the <strong>Deadcells</strong> for last couple of months because of the quick playing style that I can have a quick run in the middle of work.

Installed Steam on the device, download the game, pop in batteries for the first time on the Xbox One controller, the gaming time on Macbook is ready.

<h2>The performance is disappointing</h2>

I thought pixelated game like Deadcells should not put too much stress on the rather light spec of this Macbook but I was wrong. The game constantly running at around 50 fps which feels super laggy and my personal minimum FPS is 60, lower than that, not playable.

This is also the first time I feel the severe heat and loud fan noise coming from this gentle device. I guess gaming is bad for the health of Macbook. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/macbook-isnt-made-for-gaming/ </em><hr/></center>
