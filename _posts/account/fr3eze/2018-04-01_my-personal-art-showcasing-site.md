Thanks Steem for making me pick up the once lost drawing hobby again. I've actively created around 20 pieces of art during my days on the platform. All of them were the entries for various art contests and I've blessed that most of them were the winners!

Though Steem blockchain is the best place to store the posts permanently, it doesn't offer a good way to keep my previous artworks in a 'album' way(Steem only store text permanently, you can still lose the photos).

## So I decided to set up a website

Mainly for hosting and showcasing purpose. Never setting up one before and too lazy to pick up the learning curve, I go with the easiest option -- [Wix](https://www.wix.com/). No need to get a domain, database and server and whatsoever. All the user need to do is register an account, pick a web styyle and start uploading content onto it. Wix basically got you covered in everything.

I wanted to keep everything simple and easy. Chose a theme that host all my works on the homepage with two columns and I find it looks really good since I have different size and ratio of entries. Scroll the way down to see all the photos.

I've put on some details on the `About` page just to explain my attitude about art a little. Included email, and Discord as the way of contacting me as well.

I understand that using one-stop website solution like Wix might not be the sustainable way if things are getting serious. For example, this free package comes with a very limited  bandwidth for traffic. And the feature are quite limited on customizing the site even with premium package. But I guess that will serve the my purpose for now. Here is the URL if you would like to pay a visit:

尽管 Steem 作为是很好的展示内容创作的平台，但是对于集中性的收集帖子方面，前端网站们做的不是很好，没有提供一个类似相簿的功能。我决定做个网站来专门收集和展示以往在这里所创作过的艺术作品。由于不想（懒惰）去学习新的知识技术，我走了最快的网站建立捷径，那就是 Wix！

网站设计的主题我追求的是简单明了。在主页上就能把我所有的作品通过拉下的操作一览无遗，在 About 页面还加了点关于我对艺术创作的态度和联络方式。

虽然省却了很多麻烦，但要是以后要认真把网站搞起来的话，Wix 不会是长久之计。目前作为单纯收集的用途还是可以应付得来的。网址是：

流量有限，请不要频繁浏览，哈哈哈。
