<strong>TLDR</strong>: Mining with idles CPU power of rented VPS which almost cover 50% of the VPS cost while running a masternode on it is the most pratical lifehack I've learnt recently. Do not waste the potential of any idling resources.

<strong>太长没读</strong>：把 VPS 上闲置的 CPU 算力投入到挖矿中竟然带来了意想不到的收益，加上运行超级节点的收益应该就胜过了 VPS 的月费，而我却花了一个月多才领悟到这个道理。任何闲置的资源都很可能是被遗忘的钞票机啊！

<h2>Making use of idle CPU power</h2>

I'm running a masternode of SmartCash project on a VPS from the <a href="https://www.privex.io/">Privex</a>. The Steem-accepting VPS has been awesome, 99% uptime and least hassle of setting up. But one day when I came across the CPU-mining concept, I realised this VPS could makes some profit using its idle CPU power.

I chose the Intense coin which is running a proof-of-work Cryptonight mining algorithm. Let's do the breakdown of how this mining works on the VPS:

<ul>
<li>Zero electricity fee as the VPS is already running for the masternode.</li>
<li>Could have makes some extra bucks to cover the server fee($8 per month).</li>
<li>Make full use of the idle hashing power.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proof of concept</h2>

Out of the <strong>Prived V1 plan</strong> with dual-core CPU, the Intense coin mining on the VPS has been running for a while and this is the hashing performance graph. Let's take 150 H/s as average hashrate for the next calculation.

Using this <a href="https://miningcalculator.net/intensecoin">calculator</a>, 150 hashrate with 0 power cost and 1% pool fees gets to mine coins equivalent to $0.14 a day, $0.93 a week and <strong>$4.34 a month</strong>.

Out of the monthly $8 cost for the VPS, making full use of its CPU hashing power would make more than half the money back already without taking the real SmartCash masternode profit into account. I was quite blown away the moment I found out the posibility to actually gain more real money out of the VPS investment.

<h2>Don't stop being creative with idle resources</h2>

The CPU power was left idling for quite a long while until I started to step into the amazing mining field. <strong>Any idle resources could be another wasted money printing machine</strong> but the catch is you should know how to capitalize the full use of it in the right way. In my VPS, running a masternode and mining via CPU hashing power is not yet the best to gain most value back from the cost. More masternodes could be simply implemented in the same VPS as they normally consume least CPU and network bandwidth.

Keep learning and experiment, the tech world is awesome!
