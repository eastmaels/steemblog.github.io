I was constantly looking for a secondary device to work with when I was on the road, away from my main productivity workstation at home. Wanting some that is nice-looking, minimal, running desktop OS, sufficient minimum spec, the <strong>Surface Pro</strong> series is always my favorite line but the hefty price has been the biggest obstacle.

Surprisingly, Microsoft announced the Black Friday deal on the SP with an irresistible offer. <strong>$799 Surface Pro bundled with Type Cover</strong> which is $300 off the retail price. That deal is so nice that I had to put it in my cart and check out within 2 days while I was on my family trip on Macau.

After 10 days of shipping all the way from US to SG, and paying up to <strong>S$1300</strong> in total(S$130 worth of insurance meh), this baby has finally arrived sound and safe.

Let's get the unboxing began.

Top notch build quality and amazing unboxing experience. I suppose this is my first major physical product from Microsoft and I'm not disappointed so far. To be honest, I would not have bought this if it weren't for the huge discount and my plan B to resell it locally in SG market since Microsoft SG official store is still selling SP5.

We will see this device is going to perform and for a couple of weeks before the next review write-up. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/unboxing-the-best-deal-i-got-from-black-friday-2018/ </em><hr/></center>
