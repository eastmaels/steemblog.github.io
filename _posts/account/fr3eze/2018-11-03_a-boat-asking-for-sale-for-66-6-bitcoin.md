A random guy are selling his second hand boat for 66.6 Bitcoin or seller could just offer him any best price. At current BTC price, this boat is with a price tag of **$415,146.**

Is this too much to ask for a boat that looks like heavily used? I'm not too sure about automobile stuff like that but I guess this would be a smart trade if it could be transacted under crypto because that would waved away some avoidable sale tax?

Anyway, such extraordinary asking post already gotten some attention from the Internet and also, make sure you ping the owner if interested. Check out the detailed and original post over Reddit:
