We have reached the final destination in China before the end of our trip, Wuhan.

This is the former residence of a famous Chinese female poet, Liqingzhao(died at 1155). After much wandering from places to places', she finally decided to settle down in this simple garden and spent the rest of her life here.

Costed RMB 20 per person to visit. Many tourist spots in China is running paid model by various third parties, and not all of them are worthwhile. This garden could be one of them IMO.

终于来到中国行的最后一站，武汉。

趁此机会去了趟李清照的故居。据闻这位才名远播的女词人在多年颠沛流离后终选在此处安居度过余生，故名此园*易安居*。

我发现中国有很多名胜都被各种第三方承包下来变成收费景点了。这个易安居的入场费为每人  20 人民币，价格相较园里的内容而言，我个人觉得是不大值得的。

地点：青州古城西门外洋溪湖畔
