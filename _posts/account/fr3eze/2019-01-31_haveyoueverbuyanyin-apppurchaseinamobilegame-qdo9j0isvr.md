Just quit a game not long ago thinking that I can now put the time into something productive, fell into another game. And worse, it seems to be more addictive hence consume more of the time than ever.

Tower of Saviour is the first ever mobile game that successfully lured me into buying those virtual in-app purchase. Did not spend too much on that but I think it well worth the investment since I had a crazy time with this game back to the University time with friends. I was once a firm believer that no one should fall for the in-app purchase of any game as that <em>makes no sense</em> at all.

Then I started to think from another perspective, gaming is all about entertainment. I'm all good to spend $10 for a cinema ticket, similar to the game in-app purchase, I get <em>nothing</em> back physically but I'm entertained well. So why not?
