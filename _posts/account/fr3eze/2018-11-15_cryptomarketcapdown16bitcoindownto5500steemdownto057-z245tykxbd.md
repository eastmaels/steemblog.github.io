After a sport and late supper session last night, my buddy and I talked about how crypto market was doing lately as he is trying to catch up a little with the <em>shady investment field</em> as he would assume. We both knew the bearish market(compared to 2017) was constant all these days it even appears to be <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-btc-is-now-less-volatile-than-amazon-netflix-and-nvidia-stocks-but-still-dwarfed-by-tilray/">less volatile that some of the most famous stocks</a>.

Base on my lower-than-novice level of pattern reading skills, I jokingly mentioned that soon or later the market will be making a breakthrough by either rocketing up or plummeting down, hopefully, it was the former case. I'm bored looking at Bitcoin hovering around 6000+ for weeks, some 7000+ish or 5000+ish figures will be enough of entertaining.

<h3>To our information this morning. It was the goddamn latter case.</h3>

Holding Steem as one of my biggest crypto investment, it is fun and thrilling at the same time watching a new <em>all-time-low</em> pricing every now and then given I $0.90 was my entry point 2 back at the time.

The trick to make this constant price dipping less bothering is that I'm going to expect it to go all the way down to $0.10 and still gonna hold it tight.

What would be the price for tomorrow?
