<h2>WordPress blogging gave me some new perspective</h2>

Running the Wordpress hosting service aka Vornix I got the chance to finally owning my own blog site. If you don't count the Steemit personal page as one.

Apart from all the backend stuff, the biggest difference between creating content on Steem and personal site is the target audience. On Steem we are basically talking to the 'Steemian' in mind while in personal site, the world wide web is the audience.

<h2>Steem content should mean for everyone on the Internet as well</h2>

As Steemit.com rise to the top 1000 in Alexa ranking, more and more content will be ended up in the list of search result from worldwide people.

Unless you are the Steem witness, or posting something very Steem-centric like development and community based event, you should <strong>always keep the writing style as opened as possible.</strong>

This can be applied to most of the general categories like photography, travel, food, life, education, and many more.

<h2>Write to the world</h2>

Write as in you are not only writing to the Steemians, but to the world wide audience as well.

Readers who have no idea what Steem is, will have no idea what you were trying to bring out in the content. They don't know what is the project names you were mentioning and what are those @xxx you kept tagging(these Steem mentions will appear as normal text in WordPress site).

Therefore, there will be no connection between the content and readers because the content is not <em>talking</em> to them.

<h2>Make the content more non-Steemian friendly</h2>

<ul>
<li>Try to share only the general topic post on the Wordpress site.</li>
<li>Reduce the usage of specific greeting like <strong>Hi Steemian!</strong></li>
<li>Aurthoring a post with the non-Steemian perspective in mind. Ask yourself, <em>will I understand what I'm saying without knowing Steem in the first place?</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

Even without running own personal blogging site, this should be a great idea by address the audience to the world wide and public one.

Facebook users don't call out the others as Facebookers, YouTube viseo makers are not addressing the audience as youtubers

After all we have the same dream of making this place as good as the above-mentioned one.
