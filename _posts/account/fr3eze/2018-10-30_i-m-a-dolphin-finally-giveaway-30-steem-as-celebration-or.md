"A dollar that is not working hard to generate another dollar is a bad dollar." Powered up 200 Steem that has been idling for quite some time in the account this morning and the sense hinted me that might mean something at my current SP level. My total vested vest just climbed over the golden line, 10 MVEST

 which is approximately 5k SP.

## Imma Dolphin now!

I guess this is my first time writing a post celebrating personal achievements in Steem, **because nothing else is worth celebrating here**.

*Shed a tear for gaining over 1000 followers?* You must be new here.
*Dance over the reputation 60?* Cycle 10 SBD through voting bots is another great alternative.
*Hitting 100 upvotes in a single post?* C'mon, [@smartsteem](https://steemit.com/@smartsteem) can get you 200 upvotes easily with minimum vote buying.

However, status upgrade from minnow to a dolphin is something else. That means I now have more SP and more influence in the voting, more power in the network after all. Either I earned those SP back via writing posts or buying with real cash, that's still a **solid achievement that actually impacts my status in the network.**

## Predict Steem price and win 30 STEEM!

This is probably my first and only celebration as I do not see the possibility of achieving the next Orca status(which requires 50k SP according to this [definition](https://www.steem.center/index.php?title=Dolphin)).
And since this is some celebrations on top of Steem, I think something more related to the very platform itself would be more suitable here.

First of all, there are 3 prizes:

- First place -  15 STEEM
- Second place - 10 STEEM
- Third place -  5 STEEM

The rule is simple, **predict the Close Price of Steem in term of USD on 4 Nov 2018(UTC time)**. Closest prediction wins the first prize, the second best prediction wins second prize and so on.

- The result would be based on [Coinmarketcap's historical data](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steem/historical-data/). ![chrome_2018-10-30_22-15-54.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmWpRc1nEYnQT2q9Z2BVFXCgMP9buMnUvnGr3XNnfpvCQv/chrome_2018-10-30_22-15-54.png)
- Game **expires at 2359, 2 Nov 2018(UTC time)**[Edited: shorten the game to 3 days long to improve fairness to early predictors.]
- One prediction per account.

## How to participate?

- **Vote on this post**. Resteem is not required but would be very much appreciated if you do.
- Leave a price prediction under the comment section below with **precision of 6 decimal digits**. For example, $0.812230  or $3.235543 (LOL).

I hope I have made things clear enough. As I don't usually get good user engagement in the post, I would still give away the prize even if there is only one participant with a ridiculous prediction like 99.123354

 as that would be the closest prediction.

Let's get the prediction game started shall we?

今天刚巧 power up 了 200 Steem，直觉告诉我有点东西起了变化，尤其是我现在这个敏感的 SP level。点开 Busy 一看，果然，

## 从小鱼升级成海豚啦

在这个 Follower, Reputation, Upvotes 数量可以被操纵的平台上，SP 的的实质变化是我发现唯一值得开心和庆祝的里程碑了。毕竟变成海豚，意味着更多一点的话语权，更多一点的影响力，更有力一点的点赞！这不是比那些突破 1000 追随者什么的有意义多了吗？

有鉴于这是我第一个也非常可能是最后一个在 Steem 上的个人里程碑庆祝活动（毕竟看不到变成杀人鲸的可能性，那要 50k SP 啊我的妈），就来一次**Steem 价格竞猜游戏**吧！

首先，奖品有三个分别如下：

- 第一名 - 15 STEEM
- 第二名 - 10 STEEM
- 第三名 - 5 STEEM

再来玩法很简单，那就是**预测 Steem 在 4 Nov 2018（UTC 时间）的收市价格（close price）。**

- 游戏结果将基于 [Coinmarketcap 的历史数据](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steem/historical-data/) 做出决定。
- 游戏截止时间为 **2359, 3 Nov 2018（UTC 时间）**
- 一个用户只可以参加一次。

## 如何参与？

- **点赞此贴**。不需要 Resteem 但如果你坚持，我只好说声感激万分咯！
- 在此贴下留言你的价格预测，**预测精度必须是小数点后六位数**。例子是，$0.812230  或是 $3.235543 （哈哈）.

目前就想到这么多，有什么遗漏的规则随后会再补上。希望把规则都解释清楚了，有什么不明白的还是可以留言发文的。尽管一直以来的帖子参与度都不会太高，要是这游戏只有一个人参加，答案还是离谱的$99.123124

， 首奖还是会如约送出的，谁叫那是最靠近的答案你说对吗？！

好了，话不多说，大家都来猜一猜吧！
