This is the last day of 2017 and I shall the great timing to conclude my overall personal achievement throughout the year.

Thanks for the nomination from @angelina6688 to take part in this meaningful event. Definitely a healthy habit to constantly look back at what we’ve achieved at a yearly basis.

### Finance

2017 has been an awesome year for me financially. Stepped into the world of cryptocurrency from June, I've tripled my net worth to SGD 70k thanks to the awesome performance of Bitcoin and altcoins.

I had a non-written goal starting this year which is to make extra SGD 20k excluding my salary. To be honest I had no clue how should I achieve this, but always keeping the money-minder focus, things seemed to worked out unexpectedly well.

### Work

My career life has been normal like past few years. In fact, as I devoted most of my free time in cryptocurrency, this had somehow drew my energy away from my work. At some point of time I even thought my current job was being redundant as I found that you can easily make more in the virtual world than what I could in this job.

After all, as an system administrator I finally figured that this can be the most suitable job to combine with my new passion in cryptocurrency. Love my job again.

### Fitness

Had a minor fracture on my left wrist pulled me back from my prime strength back in 2016. Took out the *muscle up* from regular exercise and stopped my workout for 3 months was such a pain.

Luckily I managed to resume my workout routine for last couple of months. Gaining back the lost strength definitely feels good.

After all, it has been a really fruitful year for me. Appreciate it 2017!

感谢可人的 @angelina6688 提名我参加由 @yellowbird 发起2017年度steemit中文区《我的2017》年终总结写作活动。回望一年中所有的得失，多么有意义的一件事！

### 钱财

2017 绝对是个人财富大爆发的一年。从年中开始加入币圈投资的开始到现在，个人净资产已经三级跳了。这是完全意想不到的。其实年头心里就有打算今年要赚个新币20k的小计划，但心里当时是完全没谱的，也不知道如何实现。

多亏一直抱着赚钱的心态，哪里有机会就往哪里跑的态度，一切居然水到渠成，还远超预期。这也是今年最令人振奋的成就！

### 工作

工作方面则一如既往的平平无奇。这中间还因为业余时间投入过多精力在加密货币上，导致在工作上也分散了注意力，还一度怀疑过这是否自己想要的工作等。到后来摆正了心态，也重新认识到系统管理员其实可以很好的和加密货币结合。也重拾了对工作的热情。

### 健康

年中由于意外不小心搞裂了手腕骨，虽然不是什么大伤，却也足以中止我风雨无阻的训练计划长达三个月。尽管现在已经恢复锻炼了数个月，力量也大不如前，以前轻松的*暴力上杠*也难再重现。

但好在手腕的疼痛不再，力量也随着锻炼逐渐上升，相信很快就可再登巅峰。

总的来说，2017是丰收的一年！感恩！

在此献上动图一张纪念那逝去的爆发力。
