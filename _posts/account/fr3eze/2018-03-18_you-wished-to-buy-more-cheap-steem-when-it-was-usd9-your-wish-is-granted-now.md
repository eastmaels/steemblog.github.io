Woohooo, seems like I'm heading back where I've started in Steem when it was just about $1. As high as the Steem price once spiked to $9, most of us uttered in a bitter tone either verbally or on the inside:*"I wish I bought more Steem back then!"* 

Well, the market hears you and presenting you the second chance to acquire more Steem.

## Isn't this like a dream come true?

Wishing to study more after you failed that subject, hoping you could go back to fix those mistakes so that girl can come back to your arms. But none of these really happens, time doesn't go back. However, those wishes about "I wish I could buy more" that you made when the crypto market hit its ATH at 800B market cap few months back, are about to come true with the current downtrend. Be it Bitcoin, Steem, or any other coins to your preference, they are at the lowest point these few months.

## You must be so excited for this extraordinary buying opportunities, don't you?

NOPE. You are not, most of us don't.

We are so well-programmed that we tend to be happy when our investment grow in value and despair when they decline. Even to a die-hard crypto believer like myself, although I knew this crash means everything about great opportunity to buy more, unconsciously deep in my mind I feel uneasy about the overall market situation.

Often I can't help but panic a little every time I see the market total cap falls to week-low or month-low value. I have to constantly remind myself why am I so heavily invested in the crypto space, all those value and future I foreseen with the power of blockchain could bring to us all in the near future.

## Now is the best time to test your faith

If you have sold away whatever crypto you had so much trust in it, I'm sorry to say that but you are not *suitable investor* in the cryptocurrencies. Please hold those money and invest them elsewhere, but chances are you still pour the fund back in here when crypto market start to revive. Which eventually will cause you to lose money as it will crash again at some point in the future, because you are going to panic sell again.

If you haven't sold, great, maybe you are too lazy to care about what is happening in the market, or maybe you are just proved to be a strong HODLer as you vowed to be. Or even better that you plan to buy more, great. You came to this decision because you did a thorough research at the fundamental instead of blindly chasing the price chart.

How do you do in this bear market?

Steem 终于快掉到解放前了，目前价格为惨烈的 $1.64 。曾几何时冲上最高的 $9 的时候，多少人在心里喃喃自语：“*早知道当初买多点 Steem 就好了。*” 别否认了，我知道你有，我也有。

那么根据现在的走势，不就快要**心愿成真**了吗？活到现在有多少“如果当初..."是没有办法实现的，如果当初多努力读多几本书这门科目就过关了，如果当初没有说过那句话我们还会是好朋友。可是这个世界没有如果，时间只会一直往前走。

但是现在，当初抄底的心愿快要达成了，Steem 都跌成狗了，是不是走势图越往下走，你就越兴奋呢？

不是，绝大多数人都不是。

人的大脑已经被很好的编辑成遇涨则欢，逢低则悲。就算区块链死忠粉如我，夜深人静时分看着满是红色的价格表，都不禁暗暗心惊。

无论如何，这是个最好测试你信仰的最好时机。那些你曾经承诺义无反顾 HODL 到底的项目，现在都卖完了吗？
