# Unleash the true monster within the little camera

Back-bone is company that **offers a modding solution to action cameras** and aims to unleash the true power of leading sport camera like GoPro.

By using the mod-kit with C-mount, every GoPro owner can now take full advantage of the top-notch specs and quality of the camera. 

- Fixing the viewing distortion problem with stock lens
- Add shooting feature that stock action camera cannot offer like the bokeh effect and zooming ability.
- Interchange any lens to suit the shooting requirement, from 360Â° fisheye lens, macro lens, to any of your favourite SLR lens.
- Night shot? No problem, you can now shoot Infra-Red, even NIR and NDVI.

# Second, but greater life for an old gadget

More importantly, Ribcage gives the option to **re-purpose the old action camera** that might be outdated over time. Instead of chasing the never-ending technology innovation of new action camera, why not modify the existing one with a cheaper price yet to enjoy the process of granting second life to the once-favourited gadget?

Other than GoPro, Ribcage also supports famous action cameras like Sony RX0, and YI 4k/4k+.
