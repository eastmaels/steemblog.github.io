We know [what not to look at when judging if someone on Steem is popular](https://steemit.com/steem/@fr3eze/how-to-judge-if-a-steem-user-is-popularhttps://steemit.com/steem/@fr3eze/how-to-judge-if-a-steem-user-is-popular). Reputation, post payouts, comment number and votes amount. Almost all of it can be controlled by bots, to be more precise, vote-selling bot. Not being disrespectful here but those elements are just not the things to look for in hunting a popular user.

## So what to look for instead?

In my opinion, it must be the underrated **View Count!** 

Steem is one of the pioneer projects to monetize content creation that everyone keeps their focus on how to game the system to maximize profit, that they ignoring the ultimate goal of creating content -- **to attract as much attention as possible.**

I understand there are several front-end like steemit.com, busy.org, and the language-specific site like cnsteem.com. Traffic to the same content would be diversified as each individual sites only can keep the view count locally. Nonetheless, it should not be the reason to overlook the importance of this parameter.

It is easy to hit $20 for the payout with help of voting bots while the total view count is just 9. I would rather my hard work could reach 100 pairs of eyes while scoring payout with only $2. 

**A great content creator could grab a bunch of readers, but those readers might not always holding high SP.** I must not be alone in such mindset.

## Steemit.com is the only site to keep track of view count

But all it does is just providing a number on each of the posts and that's it. There is no way in the author homepage or post list that you can have an overview of *average view* or *total page view* kind of things with ease.  Because it doesn't matter very much in the world of Steem remember? View count doesn't affect payout, powerful vote does. Guess this is why no one bothers to care about this parameter much rather than those gameable value.

## But view counting is nothing more than a child's play now 

It now works as "+1 per click on the link". With automated scripts or bots anyone could easily bump up the view count of course, but it won't be happening until view count actually becomes a thing of Steem. Til then, the site owner can easily define and limit the [invalid traffic](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/16737?hl=en).

## Look for the view count

So next time when you decided to check if someone is actually having a huge crowd of audience, open a few of his recent posts and check on the view count. It might not be telling the whole truth but at least it has a certain reference value.

Do not be surprised if some superstars with 10,000 followers averaging just about 3 view count per post.

May be @steemit or @busy.org should consider making view count as one of the significant parameters in one's profile.

我相信不是每个在这里创作的人都是收入至上的，当然收入可以很可观的话是最好，但我坚信**一篇好的创作要有最大的瀑光率才可发挥其最大价值**。而讽刺的是你的忠实读者们未必会是大鱼拥有大量 SP，可以通过大力点赞来变现你的内容。

所以收入低的文章，并不等于没有品质。

在[上一篇](/steem/@fr3eze/how-to-judge-if-a-steem-user-is-popular)我说过了关注者，点赞量，留言量等等是可以操控的指标。目前似乎唯有最不受关注的**阅读量**（View count）能有参考价值，但也并非绝对。

所以如何判断一个作者是否拥有足够人气？去他的主页，点开最近几篇文章查看阅读量吧，只在 steemit.com 有用哦。
