Today I took off the crafted equipment off all 3 of my knights and started selling them according to the market price. Started the game <a href="https://steemit.com/crypto/@fr3eze/myfirstgamingexperienceontheeosblockchian--eosknight-r9h3nmdyjc">last August</a>(did not expect it was that long, feels like yesterday!), I had a rather great journey on my first ever game on the blockchain.

The reasons for me to quit including:
- <strong>The economy of the marketplace is crashing</strong>, constantly. Material that can be sold 1 EOS can drops to 0.5 EOS in a matter of weeks.
- Maintaining profitability means I have to keep spending more EOS for stronger weapon and armour in order to hunt higher level materials. This vicious cycle is never-ending.
- The game design wasn't improved much since the beginning, ex. there is no notification when a pet has completed its exhibition for user to collect its loot.
- <strong>I grew bored.</strong>

In other words, if making money is your purpose of playing this game, go elsewhere.

All in all, this game have so much to improve on and I had a great time on it. All the best to the development team! <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/quit-eosknight-after-5-months/ </em><hr/></center>
