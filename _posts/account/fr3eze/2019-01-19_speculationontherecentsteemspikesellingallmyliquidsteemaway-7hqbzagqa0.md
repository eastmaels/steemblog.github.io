Steem has been on the rise against the whole market trend, and this is very rare given my 2 years watch over the Steem price which mostly following the Bitcoin correlation.

Whatever reason Steem decided to decouple from the market and headed to the moon, I don't think it will last, at least not for the short term. <strong>There is simply more reason for Steem price to fall than to rise at this moment.</strong>

Hence here are the two things I did. <strong>Sold my remaining 165 Steem</strong> in the wallet to BTC and <strong>powering down</strong> at the same time in the hope I can sell a fraction of my stake before the price <em>goes back to where it should be</em>.

We will see if such speculation is the right call or not, soon. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/speculation-on-the-recent-steem-spike-selling-all-my-liquid-steem-away/ </em><hr/></center>
