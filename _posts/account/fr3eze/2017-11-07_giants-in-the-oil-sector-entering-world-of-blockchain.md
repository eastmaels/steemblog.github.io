Numerous energy giant firms are partnering on the blockchain-based technology. 

Shell, BP, and Statoil backing this technology to enhance certain complicated processes, with a plan to be fully operational before 2019. Several members of the oil consortium carried out the first blockchain prototype test involving an oil cargo shipment containing African crude oil which was shipping to China. The experiment demonstrated that the efficiency of certain processes can be hugely improved with the aid of blockchain based platform.

This might not be the good news to the world of cryptocurrency but Bitcoin can be benefited in this case as it is still the main ticket to access most of the altcoins. As more giants from different fields start to realize the power of blockchain technology, this could create a huge demand for the relative talent in the market. As a result blockchain technology can gradually improve and evolve at faster pace undoubtedly.

Maybe soon we can see the existence *Blockchain Engineer* would be as normal as a Human Resource to any company?

能源界的好几个巨头正在磨拳擦脚，准备迎接区块链技术的到来。

Shell ， BP 和 Statoil 如今正在研究区块链技术的潜力一解决某些特定的复杂过程，计划赶在 2019 年之前推行。在这期间原油联盟里的数个成员已经展开了实验，包括把装有非洲原油的货船运往中国。实验结果显示在区块链的技术帮助下，某些过程的效率都大大提升了。

越来越多来自各界的商业巨头拥抱区块链技术对加密货币未必是件好事，但对比特币而言应该还是利好的，毕竟必须拥有比特币才能够接触到其余绝大多数的币种。如此这般也会让市场更加渴望区块链人才的出现来填补空缺，这项技术有望未来在短时间内突飞猛进。

或许有一天，*区块链工程师*在一间公司的普通程度会和*人力资源部 (HR)*一样？
