Finally I got to buy real food with my hard earned Steem in the awesome Big Hug Burger owning by @danielwong. The boss was kind enough to withdraw himself from his very busy schedule just to say hi to me as a host. Shame we can't have more time to chat with someone who actually made his business accepting Steem for real, but this is definitely not the last time I buy food from the store!

<center>Probably the only restaurant in Malaysia that accepts Steem/SBD.

Thanks the lovely couple for holding up the meetup for me @aaronleang and @joannewong, else I would ended up eating the burger lonely in the shop LOL. Nice meeting @zord189 and @littlenewthings as well for their insights in Steem especially in how to keep growing the Teammalaysia in an efficient way.

The energy from the community is simply amazing, they are just so engaged with the technology presented by Steem. I had a joyful afternoon surrounded by a gang of friends who share the same passion as I do.

The only thing went wrong that day was that I had a really late *brunch* that I'm so full to order another long-wanted giant size of Steem burger when we arrived at the restaurant. So here I present you the **Jumbo Cheesy Sausages that I got for 2 SBD**!

The reward from a social media that I deep dived into for about a year can actually fill my stomach for real. This is not a dream, and this is not a ponzi neither. Reality checking done.

 终于在可能是全马唯一接受 Steem/SBD 的餐厅吃上一餐。这间由 @danielwong 经营的汉堡餐厅已经变成了大马 Steemian 的集聚之地，当然接受 Steem 作为现金之外，另一大原因就是这里的美食真的很好吃。说到这里就不得不提所犯下的错误了，当天由于早餐吃得太迟，到了聚会时间已经饱得吃不下向往已久的巨型汉堡了。最后只花了**2 个 SBD 买了两条大份的香肠**。

在这个平台上赚到的货币居然可以在现实生活中填饱肚子，现在想起来还是很不可思议。也更让我确定了，Steem 真的不是庞氏骗局。LOL。
