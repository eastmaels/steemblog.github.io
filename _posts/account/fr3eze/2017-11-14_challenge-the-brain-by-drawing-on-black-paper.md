As an art adventurer my self, I always looking to try out different art creating techniques. This time I would love to try drawing on black paper. Bought this black sketchbook by Daler Rowney for $18 Singapore dollar, when it comes to art supply, quality is always the top priority for me. This sketchbook features 180g/m and generous 40 pages, I will have a long time to spend on it.

The idea of drawing on a black paper initiated by the [Hat drawing contest](https://steemit.com/drawingchallenge/@helene/drawingchallenge-winners-9-and-new-theme-win-sbd) by @helene. The first thing came to my mind was the legendary Michael Jackson and his classic hat.

Ironically, I fell for Michael the day he passed away as the television mourning him with the “You Are Not Alone".  I fell in love with this song and immediately searched for all his songs and MV for the next few months, wondering how could I miss this astonishing artist when he was alive. I wished to draw a portrait of him as a gesture of tribute for a long time and this is the chance now.

>身为一个艺术冒险家，我时常在寻找不同的创作方式，这次将尝试在黑纸上作画。这本由 Daler Rowney 出品的黑色绘画本价格十八大洋，算是在店里找到最贵的同时也是最好的绘画本。在创作素材上，我永远把品质放在第一位。

>这次的新尝试受启发于由 @helene 举办的[帽子绘画比赛](https://steemit.com/drawingchallenge/@helene/drawingchallenge-winners-9-and-new-theme-win-sbdl)。第一个点子就是万古不朽的 Michael Jackson 的经典戴帽形象。

>很讽刺的，我真正认识 MJ 就是在他去世的那天。当时电视上播放着缅怀 MJ 的《You Are Not Alone》，听到的当下就立马爱上了。接下来的几个月把他所有的作品和 MV 统统翻出来欣赏研究，对这位传奇般的人物彻底心折了。一直想要画个人像来向他致敬，这次机会终于来了。

First, use a white pencil to sketch with minimal and really light force. You do not want to leave excessive white marks on the black spot which supposed to be dark shadow.
>一开始用白笔在黑纸上用最轻最少的线条勾画出轮廓，这样待会会省却很多烦恼。

Starting from the top by toning the hat and face.
>然后从帽子和脸部开始上色。

Painting the bright part of the shirt with white charcoal, which should be smudged using kneaded paper.
>用更白的白炭笔为衣服的光亮部分上色，然后用纸笔晕染。

Use lighter force for the shallow shadow area. Always remember you are now painting the light instead of dark.
>在较浅的暗影部分涂上浅白色，记得现在使用*光*在作画。

Outline the body with the sparkles of the coat, the little light sketches shall be erased afterward.
>把外套闪闪发光的部分点点上色，然后将多余的草稿勾线擦去。

I found that this black paper and white pencil works well with an eraser. Make sure you don't smudge the white color on the other part as it would be obvious.
>黑纸和白铅笔对橡皮擦的效果相当友善，很容易的就把不要的白色部分除去。

Oops, almost forgot the left-hand part and the trouser.
>差点忘了加上左手和裤子部分。

### Drawing on black paper is fun yet challenging.

As this is my first time drawing on black material, I thought should be easy as I just need to paint the bright part and the original black background will do the rest tricks for me. 

**But I was dead wrong. **

I used to use the black or colored pen to create art, and it already becomes my natural to draw in dark and leave the bright spot empty on white paper. When it comes to black paper and draw with white materials, you need to do **exactly the opposite**. I was struggling the whole process trying to fight my natural art sense and it all took me two hours to paint the whole figure when I expected to finish it within just one. Nonetheless, I would develop a more comprehensive sense of art creating after this *training*, not bad. 

Lastly, I realized this drawing could be improved to a much greater extent and that's why I make this the Part 1. Stay tuned.

### 在黑纸上作画，好玩但有挑战性。

在此之前，我以为黑纸作画也不怎么难，只需要把光源的部分呈现然后黑色的背景就会自动把暗影表达出来，反而会比在白纸上画画容易吧。

**大错特错。**

作为一个常年都在用深色笔作画的人，本能就是在白纸上把暗色画出来，把亮色的地方留白。但是用白笔和黑纸，需要做的则是**恰恰相反**。这次的绘画过程基本上就是和自己的固有价值观在摔跤。要表现暗影时自然的加大力度，结果却是变成了最亮的部分。这也让原本估计一个小时预算时间变成了两个小时。没关系，这样正好可以锻炼脑回路和开发新的艺术视角。

画到最后，我发现其实这幅画还有很大的进步空间，会在下回 Part 2 加强此画，敬请关注。
