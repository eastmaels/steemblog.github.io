I have to confess that I'm not a big time pratonist to my country, nor I'm very proud of my government for what they do. I know, you don't have to love the government to love the country. But a long-lasting, corrupted, and incompetent authority will just make you to lose some faith in the country itself.

For a Muslim-domniated country, our government has been very strict and sensitive with every issues. For example, Avril Lavigne's Malaysia concert was once banned for being too sexy.

However, this time round M'sia surprised me very much. The government is not trying to ban the very controversial crypto at all. Instead, they will **let the public decides on the fate of cryptocurrency**. The prerequisite is that developers of various crypto project team has to be at maximum transparency.

What a wise decision, feels like a total fresh breeze amongst other closed-minded decision the government has made. I'm confident the public will make things to go smooth for future crypto development on our land. And soon we shall all benefited from the finance revolution leading by blockchain.

对于那些为了打击加密货币无所不用其极的国家，出名保守迂腐的马来西亚政府在这次算是一股清流了。

国家银行代表方指出，我国不会鼓励或禁止加密货币，保持中立的同时会推出措施来让市场决定其命运。前提是那些货币的项目一切都必须最大的透明化，以确保投资者不会受欺骗。

靠，这样开明的态度居然是来自让我心碎那么多次的大马政府，是在做梦吗？无论如何，听到这样的消息还是很开心的。希望市场可以把握机会将区块链项目好好发展吧！
