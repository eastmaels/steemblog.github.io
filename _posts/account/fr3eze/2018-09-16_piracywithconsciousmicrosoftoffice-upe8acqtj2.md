Microsoft office is the golden standard in dealing with my daily documents, Word and Excel especially have been my most reliable friends over the years for its offline editing ability. Google Doc would be the best if I ever need the online syncing and quick edit feature in a multi-peer collaboration. However the MS Office pricing has been steep since my school day and still is after I started working, maybe I'm just stingy, OK I know right. Not to mention the Office 365 yearly plan is another kind of thing I hated the most, pay something every year that I would use for the rest of my life? That is not happening.

<h2>Piracy with safety</h2>

If a cracked MS Office is all you ask for, a simple google search can easily locate more than a page of the result but I'd suggest you avoid most of them. They are ready-made executable files that you can install without further ado, but you can never know what is underneath those executable other than the software you are looking for. Malicious programs could be packaged together with it and the PC will be infected the moment you execute it.

<h2>/r/piracy is a great place to look for legit pirated software</h2>

I used <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MSToolkit/comments/8ovzdq/office_20132016_c2r_install_v606_download/">Office_2013-2016_C2R_Install_v6.0.6 Download
</a> to get my Word and Excel with minimal effort and zero cost.

The installer has been verified by the Redditors and should be very safe to use. Also, make sure you <strong>confirm the checksum</strong> before installation. This should be treated as the rule of thumb every time for risky piracy attempt like this.

Beside this one, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/tools">tool page</a> also contented with another list of useful tool which I did not try out yet. You can give them a try but beware the information in the page could be outdated, perform a search on the subreddit itself before deciding which one to use is a good idea.<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/piracy-with-conscious-microsoft-office/</em><hr/></center>
