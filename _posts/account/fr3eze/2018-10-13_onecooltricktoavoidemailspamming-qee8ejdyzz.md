I know this is not a new thing and I probably look dumb to share this trick as it might seem like a <em>general knowledge</em> in the world of Internet. Just found out there are a bunch of free services like this just to serve the same purpose.

<h2>Disposable Temporary E-mail</h2>

Disposable Temporary E-mail is a service that creates a temporary email address that is going to expires in a certain time frame. It requires no registration and no password. All users have to do is open up the service site like <a href="https://temp-mail.org/en/">TempMail</a>, a random address would be generated and ready to use.

I'm the temporary owner of this <code>mimesijiv@oranek.com</code> and I'm not sure how long before it is gone. But it is alright since I just need some addresses to give away during my recent attempt to download something free from a <em>free</em> website.

The best part is service like this will handle all the incoming emails thus users are able to reap the content which usually to be some sorts of download links or any confirmation code. In my case, this is a perfect use case.

One thing to note though, some websites are smartly designed to reject all the temporary email addresses from these disposable mail services so the next best idea to get rid of spamming is <strong>getting secondary spam email account</strong> just for this purpose.<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/one-cool-trick-to-avoid-email-spamming/</em><hr/></center>
