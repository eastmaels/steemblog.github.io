## Hunter's comment
Let's take a look at preinstalled Store apps in the list. 3D builder, Food, Health, Get Skype, Maps, Money, Sway, Reader, bet you never open or even heard of those apps the whole time operation on the Windows 10!

Unfortunately, those bloatwares are installed together with the operating system and you cannot find them in the `Uninstall Program` list. Though the powershell commands do offer an alternative to get rid of those apps, it is no simpler than using **10AppsManager**.

**10AppsManager is a simple tool to uninstall/reinstall the bloatwares with just one click.** I could not provide more picture because it has only one interface and that's it. Work flawlessly and why you should reduce unwanted apps:

- Windows startup gets a lot quicker without having to load all these unnecesary apps.
- Gain extra CPU processing power(tested and proven myself.)
- Make your operating system truly yours with just a few clicks.

You don't have to delete all of the apps. The rule of thumb is, delete whatever you never opened or did not even know they existed before. Keep those you actually know and use, I kept the `Photos` for instance.

Let's keep the Windows 10 fit the way it should!
