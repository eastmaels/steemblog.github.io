The long waited Game 7 is here! To me, this is a fight between Lebron vs the whole young team of Celtics. After all, Lebron alone will out-experience the green Celtics in playoff career. But Game 7 is something special, you do not win one by using experience but there are much much more elements in it. 

Celtics has proven that they are capable of dealing with any kind of enemy despite of losing their superstars in the beginning of season. They are young but ultimately determined. They have been too the underdogs along the way since they made it into playoff and breaking the expectation of people again and again by winning over the 76ers and Bucks. No one is going to look down on the green team now.

But the enemy is the King of eastern conference finals of NBA for almost a decade, Lebron James. Although I'm not particular fan of him, I know he is capable of accomplishing anything on the court. 

The game definitely worth a day leave just to watch it live.
