Finally my family trip in Macau has come to an end. Nothing can be more interesting than combing from a 6 days travel to find out my Steem wallet worth almost 30% less. Oh, I should have stick to the travel topic, let's talk more about crypto in the next post. I've now spent 1 month combined in Macau both from a business and casual trip, what about sharing some tips for travelling in Macau?

<ul>
<li>Bus and walking is the best travelling method in the island. Walking probably would be prioritized more.</li>
<li>Bus fare was 6 MOP per trip regardless of travelling distance.</li>
<li>Prepare coins or small value cash for the bus fare as there is no change would be provided.</li>
<li>Most famous restaurants shut down at 10pm. Less <em>format food</em> one could find after that hour except for some snacks.</li>
<li>In some casino wide variety of drinks are provided for free, as well as food like the instant noodles.</li>
<li>Baccarat is the most famous game among all the Macau's casinos. Pontoon is nowhere to be seen(my favorite game) but BlackJack is easily available as alternative too.
-Spend MOP instead of HKD for daily expenses.</li>
<li>Make use of free casino buses whenever possible.</li>
<li>Free wifi is a thing here in Macau. It is even available on bus.</li>
</ul>

So far these are all the tips I could think of. Maybe I should add in more and tidy the list up in the future. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/some-tips-for-travelling-in-macau/ </em><hr/></center>
