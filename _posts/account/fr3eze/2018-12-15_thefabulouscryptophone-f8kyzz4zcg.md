If you haven't heard of the famous crypto phone <strong>HTC Exodus 1</strong> which you can get a quick look over the <a href="https://www.htcexodus.com/sg/">official landing page</a>, check them out as it is quite hyped up now.

<strong>But I don't think it is a worthwhile investment as a phone.</strong>

I took a quick look on the phone specs and selling points. Exodus 1 comes with a modern spec that many other phones are sharing, nothing short but nothing outstanding on the paper.

While the biggest selling points could be summed up as follows:
- The only crypto is acceptable for payment.
- Build-in crypto wallet.
- Integrated Brave as the default browser.

Basically, it is just a <em>smart</em> hardware wallet. A hardware wallet that is able to make calls. While crypto <strong>security</strong> is the main attraction here, making your hardware wallet a smartphone just degrade the security so much. Simple, when a device offers a dozen ways for decryption other than just the 12-word seeds, it makes the device more vulnerable.

Furthermore, this crypto phone just supporting coins like BTC, LTC, ETH and ERC-721 and they called it All-in-one wallet. Just buy a Ledger Nano for under $100 would be a much wiser choice. <br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/the-fabulous-crypto-phone/ </em><hr/></center>
