Discord and Telegram to me is very much a crypt-related tool than any other purposes. All sorts of crypto channels, ICO groups, airdrop chats filling up these two messenger apps. I keep telling myself not to dive too deep in the sea of new coins or project or it will be draining all my time catching up with 100 different channels a day.

<em>Keep things minimal and only join channels that really interest me</em> is my only strategy when it comes to adding a new chat. Nonetheless, the channel list still growing to the extent I have to mute most of the chats and only focus on those I currently working on.

Beside the above-mentioned two texting apps, some other apps I started to use more due to crypto was Steemchat, Slack, and even Wechat.

My favorite would still be Discord for the multi channels structure within a server makes it easier for user to navigate through different projects. I would use Telegram for more anonymous purpose like sending myself some crypto addresses or even mediocre private keys.

What is your favorite communication apps for crypto?

Discord 和 Telegram 都是作为 crypto 沟通上最主要的工具。唯一要小心的就是不要什么频道都加入，不然一不小心就会名单爆满，每个都关注一点就足以蚕食大量的时间。所以现在我都是静音了大多数的频道，只关注目前我关心的项目。<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/channels-servers-chats-on-crypto-communication-can-be-overwhelming/</em><hr/></center>
