Just celebrated the 10 years anniversary of high school graduation this year. Looking back for what I've achieved since the day stepped out from the school gate. Took a Bachelor title, in a stable relationship with girlfriend, working on a 9-5 job, taking average wages. Life has been so dull to make me feel like I wasn't doing good at all.

Last week I had a late night gathering with old classmates and we had a great moment sharing our recent development. I have lost touch with most of the old friends from the same school, it was a good opportunity to catch up with their news.

Friend A was addicted to gambling, spent most of his earning into soccer gambling. Won a little at first, lost all the way after. The worst part was he seek financial help from the loan shark. Soon after he lost the borrowed fund too, he asked for another loan shark to cover the previous debt. The snowball effect makes him ended up in a really bad debt situation. He owed a lot to his close friends too.

Friend B is optimistic and won't even care if his bank account often hovering below 4 digit number. This figure almost can represent a broke status given he already working for a few years. He was really into the fish fighting business and the peak time he got almost 50 small jars for his fishes in his room. Due to unknown reason, his fish business was closed and I don't hear of him starting another business.

Friend C having a relatively laid-back job although he always claimed to be very busy at work. We can often see him chilling in the cafes and his usual night activity is to spend the whole night chit-chatting and playing mobile games with the friends in the street vendors. His income is not high, if he can use his time wisely we would keep hearing complaints from him that the money is always lacking.

Friend D still fighting for his boring Amway MLM dream. Friends around him already developed the habit to sneer at his typical motivational marketing quotes in social media.

Friend E was the most miserable. He was so introvert that not many have talked much with him during school time. Only to find out he was gone for a sickness earlier this year.

After all, I realized that I'm actually doing better than most of them.

岁月匆匆，中学毕业至今已有十个年头。回顾这段日子，生活上到底有什么斩获。拿了个学士头衔，有着一段稳定的感情，干着一份早九晚五的工作，领着不高不低刚好够用的薪水。一直觉得日子过得有点平淡，混得如我这般的水平其实也是有点不尽人意。

不久前在家乡和中学时期的三五好基友聚会。许久不见，大家高谈阔论天南地北至深夜，相聚甚欢。由于出国工作，许多旧时同窗已经好久没联系，至多在社交网络上偶有神交，不知不觉就和朋友聊起他们的近况。

同学A原来染上赌瘾，把打工赚来的钱都花在赌球上。过程也是老套的先尝到点甜头，然后就有去无回的一直输下去。最糟糕的是他还向高利贷借钱来赌，输了再借其他的高利贷来还钱。这样反复操作终于让他欠下了好几组的高利贷债务，听说身边和他相熟的朋友也有不少结果他钱的。听说后来终于肯乖乖安分的打份工来还债了。

同学B天性豁达乐观。毕业后喜欢上了斗鱼，这种鱼俗称*打架鱼*。身躯娇小，生性好斗，把两只同时放在同一个容器里不久后就会看到它们都个天翻地覆，至死方休。所以也有所谓的斗鱼运动，就是比谁的鱼才是打架王。这种鱼还有一个特色，就是品类众多，从平平无奇到色彩鲜艳的鳞色，简直目不暇给。这样的特性也促成了斗鱼的选美比赛，比谁的鱼更华丽出色。同学B巅峰时期家里收藏了多达四五十条的斗鱼，满满的整个房间都是大大小小的容器，还时常飞去泰国入货，做起斗鱼买卖，隐隐有借此维生之势。

后来不知是因为经营不善还是什么就不干了，听说他偶尔有提起银行户口经常都是徘徊在四位数之间，神色间也满不以为意。这对一个在社会工作了五六年的人来说几乎是破产级别的。

同学C干着一份挺悠闲的差事，虽然嘴上常说自己有多么的忙不过来。却总是能够在各大咖啡厅和路边摊看到他的身影，也常常无所事事和朋友在摊子聊天打手游，从晚上一直到凌晨。他收入也不高，却把日子过得如此不上进。和他说过要是把这份闲情花在有用的地方上，就不用整天和我们埋怨钱不够用了。

同学D搞安利传销搞了好几年，业务也不见起色。反而在看到他朋友圈依旧积极推销产品时，我们已经养成调侃他的习惯了。

同学E更惨，中学时期已经时绝世孤僻了，和他说过两句话的人也没几个，近来居然听说他因病去世了。

忽然发现，自己原来混得已经很好了。
