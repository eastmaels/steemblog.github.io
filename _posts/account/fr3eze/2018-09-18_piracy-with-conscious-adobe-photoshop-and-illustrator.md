First and foremost, I'm not a designer and I don't make a living or any profit out of these awesome tools but due to the hobby development, they are casually needed for some practices and work modification here and there. Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator is the golden duo that most of the graphic designers relying on if you cannot live without them the best idea is to pay for it. Support the product that makes some real cash for you is the best way to encourage its healthy growth at the same save up a lot of headaches pirating it.

## The ultimate Adobe Suite pirating tool: CCMaker

Get them via the link below or any sources that you find reliable:

Some notes to take before installing the download:
- Be extra cautious when choosing the sources to download, the Reddit link above is reputable enough.
- Always check against the checksums of the downloaded files with the hash provided from the sources. Be careful if the source did not provide one. HashCheck is one of the most convenient tools I ever used for checksum purpose.
- Most anti-virus is likely to detect the file as a threat due to the false positive algorithm.

CCMaker let users download all the versions of different Adobe products and install it and finally, authenticate/crack it with the famous **AMTEmu** which is a software protection emulator specially tailored-made to get rid of the authorization mechanism of Adobe programs. In other words, AMTEmu can work without CCMaker at all provided you can source the authentic AMTEmu program from the Internet which is difficult nowadays as I couldn't locate one myself. With the standalone AMTEmu, you can go to the official Adobe and download all the products you want and crack them with this tool. This way you are likely to bypass the risk of a funny altered version of Adobe version.

I would just stick with CCMaker for the ultimate convenience and reputation. And the only bad thing is that it is not open source, I gotta trust someone that this tool is not gamed before my download. If you are extremely paranoid but do not wish to spare the expensive Adobe subscription fee, get the CCMaker and use it in a virtual machine.
