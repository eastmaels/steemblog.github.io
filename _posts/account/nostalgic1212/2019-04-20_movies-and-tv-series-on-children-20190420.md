I don't know how many people on Steemit have ever seen the Taiwanese TV series, but it is definitely a work that will change my impression of the Taiwanese TV show. The title is based on the poem of Khalil Gibran, and I found [a good version](http://www.sohu.com/a/204931964_507529) about the original text and the translation of this poem.

At first, I was attracted by its creepy poster. The poster portends that while it's not a horror movie, it may be even scarier than a horror one.

There's a baby in the middle of the poster, connecting to its mother by the umbilical cord. His hands are locked, which means that even if the umbilical cord is cut, the child will not be free from the "shackles" of his mother. The baby's brain is silhouetted against the face of a mother.

I think the general idea here is that even if children are born, their body and mind will be under the control of the mother for decades of years, without the right to control their own future.

The series consists of five short stories, including ***Mother's Remote***, ***Cat's Baby***, ***Molly's Last Day***, ***Peacock*** and ***Must Move***. Among these stories, my favorite one is ***Molly's Last Day***.

At the beginning of the episode, the lovely daughter Molly committed suicide by jumping off a building. Her mother did not understand why her daughter became like this, so she try to find the truth by all means. She even resorted to immature cutting-edge technology to extract her memories from Molly's body.

In Molly's memories, her mother who graduated from an elite school gave up her studies and work for the sake of children, and became a full-time wife to take care of her family at home. Their house is full of monitors, and they are under close surveillance by their mother. Molly is fond of writing, while her mother forbids her from pursuing the dreams.

If your parents are trying to manipulate your life like this, will you also feel that life is meaningless, just like Molly?

***On Children*** is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by author Wu Xiaole, has sparked a heated debate in Taiwan after the she wrote the parent-child relationship twisted by education she witnessed. 

The TV series, with its strong fantasy narrative and micro-sci-fi style, has been treated as the Taiwan's version of ***Black Mirror***. Coincidentally, in the second episode of ***Black Mirror*** SE04, ***Ark Angel*** is about a mother who interferes too much in her child's life.

After watching this TV series, a complicated feeling haunted in my mind: parents should not put their own dreams forced on the children, and the children should have the ability to control their own destiny as well as the right. Parents are probably the only "career" that doesn't require an exam or an interview, which is definitely a horrible thing.


「中文部分」

我不知道Steemit上有多少人看过这部台湾电视剧，但这绝对是一部颠覆我对台湾电视剧印象的一部作品。剧名出自纪伯伦的诗，关于这首诗的原文及翻译我找到了一个[比较好的版本](http://www.sohu.com/a/204931964_507529)。

最开始我是被它令人毛骨悚然的海报所吸引，这也就预示着虽然它不是恐怖片，但可能要比恐怖片还要令人背后发凉。

海报正中央的是一个婴儿，脐带将它和母亲联系起来。它的双手处有一把锁，代表着即使剪断脐带孩子也无法脱离母亲的“桎梏”。婴儿的脑部剪影，仔细看的话是一位母亲的样子。

我想，这里大致想表达的意思是：孩子即使出生了，他们的身心在今后的几十年里都会受到母亲的控制，没有自由支配的权利。

这部电视剧由五个小故事组成，其中包含了《妈妈的遥控器》、《猫的孩子》、《茉莉的最后一天》、《孔雀》和《必须过动》。在这些故事里面，我最喜欢的就是《茉莉的最后一天》。

这集一开始，在父母眼中乖巧的女儿茉莉跳楼自杀了。她的母亲并不明白自己的女儿为什么会变成这样，于是她用了各种手段去寻找真相。她甚至不惜借助还未成熟的尖端技术，从茉莉的尸体里面提取她生前的记忆。

在她的记忆里，名校毕业的母亲为了她们两姐妹放弃了学业和工作，做个全职太太在家里照顾家人。在她们的家里，无论哪里都是监视器，母亲监控着她们的一举一动。茉莉喜欢写作，但母亲认为那是浪费时间的、没有用处的东西而禁止她去追求梦想。

如果你的父母是这样子的，会不会也像茉莉一样觉得生活没有什么意义了呢？

**《你的孩子不是你的孩子》**改编自作家吴晓乐的同名小说，作者将她亲眼目睹的各种因教育而扭曲的亲子关系整理后写成这本小说，发行后在台湾引发了热烈讨论。这本书和剧大热的时候，我正好在台湾旅行，诚品书店醒目位置上正是摆放着这部小说。

看完这部电视剧以后，我最大的感叹就是：父母不应该把自己的梦想强行加注在孩子的身上，他们应该有掌握自己命运的能力和权利。父母大概是唯一不需要通过考试或者面试就可以直接上岗的“职业”，这实在是太可怕了…
