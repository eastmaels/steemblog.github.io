嗨，十年后的自己，你还好吗？在十年前的今天，在一系列测试和检查后，我们被确诊了抑郁症和焦虑症，情况不是那么乐观。在医生告知的那一刻，我并不知道停不下来的眼泪，到底是因为恐惧、后悔还是不甘心。刚好社区办了这次活动(感谢@rivalhw)，想对十年后的你，说这三件事。

Hey there, ten years have pasted, and are you okay? Ten years ago, at the same day, after a series of tests and examination, we were diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and the situation was not so positive. At the moment the doctor told the result to me, I didn't know whether I could not stop crying, for maybe it's fear, regret, or reluctance. The community organized the event and wanted to say these three things to you ten years from now.

1、别再傻乎乎的喜欢上一个人

不是所有的人都是抱着善意而来，在没有确定对方是真心的情况下，不要对这个人太用心。要相信自己的直觉。进化论下来，女人的直觉是一项天赋。往往你内心在想的，担心的事情，那就是真的。不要在期望用温情去打动一个心不在你身上，或者是已经准备要走的人。这只是在陪伴他度过没有你的日子，等他彻底习惯了，你最后的价值也没有了。你永远叫不醒一个装睡的人，也不可能捂热一块化不开的寒冰。

Don't be a fool to like someone else with full-heart

Not all people come with good intentions, and don't take the person too seriously without making sure he is sincere. Trust your instincts. Evolutionarily, a woman's intuition is a gift. What you're thinking and worrying about, always comes to the truth. Don't try to impress a person who is not with you, or who is ready to go. It's just being with him through the days without you, until he gets used to it, and your last value is gone. You will never wake up a fool, nor can you cover the hot ice.

2、充实自己的生活，有自己的事业

即便是好的状态下，我们都不是那种喜欢社交活动的人。但是线上是，那么，就多交些线上的朋友吧。找一件或者几件自己爱做的事情，如果能发展成事业，那也是极好的。

2. Enrich your life and have your own career

Even in the best of times, we're not the kind of people who enjoy social activities. But we like talking with people online, so just do it. Find one or several things you love to do, and that's great if you can develop into a career.

3、学会享受孤独

我们太害怕一个人了，心理上。我们是独立的人，做事、思考问题都可以独立完成，而且往往这样的效率最高。但是心理上，依赖朋友和恋人的陪伴。我们太敏感了，对于周遭在乎的人一点点变化，都草木皆兵。一到恋爱更是如此，会想对方所想，爱对方所爱，慢慢的失去自我。

Learn to enjoy solitude.

We are too afraid of being alone, mentally. We are independent people, for we can do things independently, and we often have the highest efficiency in that way. But psychologically, we rely on the companionship of friends and lovers. We are so sensitive that any changes in the relationship will freak us out. When you are in a relationship, you will think of each other, love each other, and slowly lose yourself.

十年后的自己，我希望你已经成为上面我说的，希望你成为的样子。如果有机会，十年后你和他还有交集，请对他说一句：我不恨你，还有，谢谢你出现过。

Ten years after, I hope you have become what I said above. If you have a chance to have an intersection with him at that time, please say to him: I don't hate you, and thank you for showing up.
