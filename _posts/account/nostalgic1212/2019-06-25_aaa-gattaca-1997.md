On the recommendation of my friend, I watched a science fiction film about genetic fatalism called ***Gattaca*** this weekend. Although it was shot in 1997, it still not outdated.

In a certain age, genetic engineering technology has a rapidly development. By the time the child was born, his parents and other surroundings had already known what diseases he would suffer and how many years he would live.  **Vincent Freeman** was told he would only live to 30, so his parents used genetic screening technology to give birth to another boy. Because of his genetic defects, Vincent can't go to good schools, get social security, or get a good job.

When he passed the 30th's birthday, he decided to work hard for his own fate. Through his own efforts and the help of three people around him, he finally fulfilled the dream of becoming an astronaut step by step.

The three person who help Vincent in this movie are Irene, Jerome and a doctor. **Jerome** was once a swim athlete, while an accident left him permanently disabled. **Irene** has a good brain, since she has a genetic defect in her heart, she has to do simple administrative work in the space center. **The doctor** also had a genetically defective son, so he treat Vincent as his own son. These three person found something similar with Vincent, and they feel themselves share Vincent's joy of victory when seeing him achieve his own dream. 

After finish watching the movie, we would ask ourselves several questions: Does genetic engineering technology really so accurate? If you know what diseases you would have and when you would die from the day you were born , would you still choose to live happily every day?

在朋友的推荐下，周末我看了一部有关基因宿命论的科幻片《千钧一发》。虽然这是一部1997年拍摄的电影，但是现在看依然不会觉得过时。

在某一个年代，基因工程技术迅猛发展。孩子出生的时候，父母和周围的人就已经知道他将患有哪些疾病以及可以活到多少岁。男主角文森就被断言只能活到30岁，于是他的父母采用基因筛选技术生下另一个男孩。文森因为基因缺陷不能上好的学校、不能享受社保、也不能有好的工作，但事实上他无论智力还是体力都比弟弟强。

过了30岁还活着的文森，决定为了自己的命运努力一把。他通过自己的努力和身边三个人的帮助，终于一步一步实现了成为宇航员的梦想。

这部电影里面出现的三个帮助文森的人，分别是艾琳、杰罗姆和体检医生。杰罗姆曾经是游泳健将，却因为一场事故导致终生残疾；艾琳头脑很好，却因为心脏有基因缺陷不得不在宇航中心做简单的行政工作；体检医生家里同样有一个基因缺陷的儿子，看到文森让他想到自己的儿子。每个人都在文森身上看到自己的影子，看到他实现梦想会让他们觉得自己也分享了胜利的喜悦。

当看完电影结束，我们会思考一个问题：基因检测真的这么准确吗？如果你知道从出生那天起就知道自己将会有哪些疾病又会在什么时候死亡，你还会依然选择好好度过活着的每一天吗？
