早在17年12月底的时候，贺岁片之战就在冯小刚的《芳华》及陈凯歌的《妖猫传》领跑下悄然打响。进入1月后，一匹黑马进入观众的视线，那就是《前任3---再见前任》。说实话，一部爱情片拍成几部曲的，印象中只有两个系列深的我心。其中一个是：爱在黎明破晓前 Before Sunrise‎ (1995) 、爱在日落黄昏时 Before Sunset‎ (2004)、 爱在午夜降临前 Before Midnight‎ (2013)，表现很平稳，豆瓣都在8.5以上。另一部是香港导演叶念琛的作品：《我的最爱 L for Love, L for Lies》、《独家试爱 Marriage with a Fool》、《十分爱 Love Is Not All Around》。

As early as the end of December 17, the battle of the New Year film was launched quietly under feng xiaogang's "fanghua" and Chen kaige's "the demon cat". As it comes to January, a dark horse enters the audience's line of sight, that is "The Ex-File: The Return of the Exes". To be honest, there are only two series of love movie which I prefer to. One of them is: Before Sunrise ‎ (1995), Before Sunset, ‎ (2004), Before Midnight ‎ (2013), the performance is very stable, watercress is above 8.5. The other one is the work of a Hong Kong director called ye chenchen: "L for Love, L for Lies", "Marriage with a Fool" and "Love Is Not All Around".

这次的《前任3---再见前任 The Ex-File: The Return of the Exes》（以下简称《前任3》）在上映10天内斩获12亿票房。根据猫眼预测，其最终票房有望突破21亿。院线对其的排片一开始只有16%，因为票房一路高歌，后改至41.2%（数据来源：http://finance.ifeng.com/a/20180107/15913437_0.shtml）。

This time, "The Ex: The Return of The Exes" has grossed $1.2 billion in 10 days. According to the cat's eye, its final box office is expected to exceed 2.1 billion. The cinema line began with only 16 percent of its line, as the box office hit the top line, and then 41.2 percent. (source: http://finance.ifeng.com/a/20180107/15913437_0.shtml).

为何一部看起来很一般的电影能在贺岁档中杀出一条血路，并且让不少观众说在影院看的哭成傻X呢？

Why a film looks very general can fight its way out in the movie market, and make a lot of audience cry in the cinema?

1、从观众群体来看   From the audience group

这是一部适合所有人去看的电影。单身的去看可以学学里面的“套路”，有对象的去看可以知道对方是怎么想的。男人和女人是完全不同的两种生物，而中国人很多时候不善于表达自己的想法和感情。

This is a movie for everyone to see. If you are single, you can learn the "routine" in it. If you have a boyfriend or girlfriend, you can see what they are thinking about. Men and women are totally different creatures, and Chinese people are often bad at expressing their thoughts and feelings.

2、从内容编排来看   From the content arrangement

和普通爱情片不同，这部电影里面几乎看不到恋人间的甜言蜜语，也没有太多撕心裂肺的眼泪。里面展现的爱情，就是现代社会中爱情的样子---女生会收其他爱慕者的包，会用小心机去考验男友对自己的真心；男生会有自己暧昧的红颜知己，永远喜欢新鲜的人和事物，内心也总是住着一个长不大的孩子。韩庚那一对演出了一对情侣五年之痒的样子，郑恺这对则演出了一对逗比情侣是如何相爱相杀的。总的来说电影本身将爱情和喜剧两个元素融合的比较好.

Unlike ordinary love story, the film contains few honey words between lovers, and also it does not have too many tears. The love appears in the movie, is indeed the love in the modern society --- the girls will accept presents from other admirer, will use skills to test boyfriend's heart; Boys will have their own flirtatious confidants, always like fresh people and things, and always have a small child in their hearts. Han geng's performance of a couple which suffers five years' itch, and zheng kai shows the performance of the daily things between love birds. In general, the movie itself combines the two elements of love and comedy quite good.

3、从结局设定来看   From the ending

一般来说，爱情类电影的最后，只要男女主角都活着（哪怕一方残疾）基本都是happy ending。这和主角带有光环是一个道理，大家都觉得就是要大团圆的才是结局。这部片子，男女主角是真的分开了，也有了各自新的归宿。不少看了电影的朋友对我说：爱情中如果少一点口是心非，那就不会有那么多因为错过而分手的人。为什么会有人纠结分手后是谁先联系了谁，难道面子真的比深爱的人在身边互相陪伴来的更重要？

Generally speaking, the main characters should be together (even if one of them is disabled) . It is the same reason as heroes can never die. In this film, the hero and heroine are really separated, and have their new loved one. Many of the friends who watched the movie said to me: if there is less duplicity in love, there won't be so many people break up. Why people are so obsessed with who has to contact firstly after the separation.

当然豆瓣给6.0这样并不高的分数也并不是没有理由

Of course, it is reasonable that that douban valves it to 6.0, which is not a high score

1、部分情节略显恶俗。比如，韩庚和郑恺在与一对姐妹花约会时，因为妹妹长相有些寒碜，兄弟俩的表情着实让人感到有些不舒服

1. Part of the plot is slightly vulgar. For example, when han geng and zheng kai are dating a pair of sisters, because of the younger sister's appearance, the men's reaction is making audience feel not so comfortable.

2、中段之后的情节相当拖沓。不知现在是不是流行拍上两个小时的电影，个人觉得这一部绝对不需要这个时长。一部可以在70分钟内讲完的故事，拖沓不已，看的昏昏欲睡。

After the middle period, the plot is rather slow. I don't know whether it is popular for two hours in the movie, I think this one absolutely don't need this time, and should be finished within 70 minutes.
