Around the middle of April, I was attracted by an article titled <strong><em>Did the Divine Director Step Down From the Altar</em></strong>. Since then, I learned about the movie <strong><em>The Third Murder</em></strong>, and the director mentioned in the article is <strong>Koreeda Hirokazu</strong>. To tell you the truth, I was not familiar with the name. In order to get some information about him, I turned over his data and it turns out that he had produced many famous films. For example: <strong><em>Air Doll</em></strong>, <strong><em>After the Storm</em></strong>, <strong><em>Kamakura Diary</em></strong> and <strong><em>Manbiki kazoku</em></strong>. These wonderful family films suddenly gives me the idea to have a good look at the movie of <strong><em>The Third Murder</em></strong>.

The suspect <strong>Sankou (Koji Hashimoto)</strong> was charged with robbery and murder, and the defense attorney <strong>Shigeru (Fukuyama Masaharu)</strong> began an investigation. The confession of Sankou is different each time. From robbery to theft after murder to fiduciary murder. In the end, the suspect confessed that he had not killed anyone. The defense attorney became suspicious and began to suspect that Sankou was not the real criminal but that there was another case.

To conserve litigation resources, the judge allowed the prosecution to proceed in the same manner as before, even though he knew that the suspect might not the murder. The prosecutor or the lawyer cooperate with the judge, and they seems to reach a balance. In the eyes of this group: <strong>"The law is not the place to pursue the truth, but the place to adjust the stakes."</strong> I have seen this opinion in a Japanese TV drama called <a href="https://cnsteem.org/cn/@nostalgic1212/vicky-s-99-9">99.9% ：刑事専門弁護士</a>, which shows that it seems to be the common sense in the judicial system.

By this time, the appearance of the victim's daughter Saki (Suzu Hirose) changes the plot. The girl was willing to tell the secret of being raped by her father in order to exonerate the suspect. I think the reason Sankou wanted to take all the responsibility at the very first place is that he wanted to keep the girl from giving the embarrassing testimony. In this gloomy tale, the warmth between the suspect and the victim's daughter is unsentimental.

In my opinion, the title<strong>《三度目の殺人》</strong>should be translated as <strong><em>The Third Murder</em></strong>, rather than <strong><em>The Third Suspect</em></strong>, which is full of suspense reasoning style. To some extent, I think the translator gave the audience a false impression and a wrong positioning for the film. <strong><em>The Third Murder</em></strong> is an ethical film about family and death under the cloak of law and suspense. What's more, the director did not clarify who was the killer, even the end of the film.

<strong>Chinese Version</strong>

大约是4月中旬的时候，我被一篇名为<strong>《神级导演是否走下了神坛》</strong>的电影公众号文章吸引，进而知道了这部<strong>《第三度嫌疑人》</strong>，而里面提到的导演就是：<strong>是枝裕和</strong>（名字就是这四个字😂）。讲真，看到名字的时候Vicky是没有什么印象的，心想着都没听过这个导演谈什么走不走下神坛。一边这么想着，一边翻着他的资料。这才发现，原来就是他拍了<strong>裴斗娜参演的《空气人偶》、阿部宽参演的《比海更深》、绫濑遥、长泽雅美参演的《海街日记》以及最近超火爆的《小偷家族》</strong>。这些很棒的温情家庭片，突然让我有了好好看一看这部电影的想法。

嫌疑人三隅（役所广司）被控抢劫杀人，重盛朋章（福山雅治）的辩方律师重盛开始对真相展开调查。三隅的供述每次都不一样。<strong>从抢劫杀人到杀人后盗窃，再到受托杀人。最后，嫌疑人翻供称自己并没有杀人。</strong>辩方律师觉得里面疑点重重，开始怀疑他并非真凶而是案中有案。

法官为了节省诉讼资源，在即便知道也许嫌疑人并为杀人的情况下，依然让检控双方还按照原来的模式继续进行。检察官也好，律师也罢，都在法官示意的眼神下达成了某种默契。在这群人眼里：<strong>“法律不是追求真相的地方，而是调整利害关系的地方。”</strong>同样的言论，我曾在日剧<a href="https://cnsteem.org/cn/@nostalgic1212/vicky-s-99-9">刑事专业律师 99.9% 刑事専門弁護士</a>看到过，足以见得这点在司法体系中有多么司空见惯。

这时候，害者的女儿咲江（广濑铃 饰）的出现，又改变了剧情的走向。女孩为了给嫌疑人开罪，甘愿说出自己被父亲强奸的隐秘。我想，三隅一力承担所有罪责，也是为了不让女孩说出那些难堪的证词。在这个阴郁的故事中，嫌疑人与被害人女儿之间的温情不经让人动容。

以我粗浅的日文水平来看，片名《三度目の殺人》直译过来应该是《第三次杀人》，而不是富有悬疑推理篇风格的《第三度嫌疑人》。某些程度来说，我觉得是译者给了观众以错觉，让观众对影片产生了错误的定位。在我看来，《第三度嫌疑人》是一部<strong>披着法律和悬疑外衣实则讲述家庭和死亡</strong>的伦理片。而我们的导演，直到影片最后也为阐明到底谁才是杀死被害人的凶手。
