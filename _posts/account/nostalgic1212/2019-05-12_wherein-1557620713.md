Under presently social media atmosphere, both the audiences and media workers are pursuing hot topics, and no one is willing to calm down to present the panorama of the news. I've seen this point before in the TV series ***Fake News*** starring by Keiko Kitagawa, and it's also one of the main themes in the teledrama ***The World Between Us***.

The story begins with an indiscriminate killing in a movie theater, which unfolds the story of several families in different positions, ideas and situations.

现在这种社交媒体之下，无论是观众还是媒体工作者，大家都在追求热点，没有人愿意静下心来去呈现新闻的全貌。这个观点我曾经在北川景子主演的**《虚假新闻》**中看到过，而这点同时也是**《我们与恶的距离》**的主题思想之一。

故事是由一起发生在电影院的无差别杀人事件开始的，以此展开了几个不同立场、想法、处境的家庭的故事。

**「The Victims 受害者」**

Qiaoan Song and Shaoguo Liu, this couple are both journalists. They often argued over their different understandings and practices of journalism, which became more serious after their son was killed. 

After the death of her son, Qiaoan Song's temper became unpredictable. Because of insomnia, she was addicted to drinking, which made the relationship with her daughter become even tenser.

The pain of losing her son, the hatred of the abuser and the disappointment of her cheating husband, Qiaoan Song vent all her emotions to the workplace.

宋乔安（贾静雯 饰）和刘昭国（温升豪 饰）都是新闻从业者，两人因为对于新闻的理解和做法不同常常产生争吵，这一点在儿子被杀害后变得更为严重。在儿子去世以后，宋乔安的脾气变得阴晴不定，加上因为失眠而开始酗酒，与女儿的关系也变得很紧张。

失去孩子的痛、对施暴者的恨以及对出轨丈夫的失望，宋乔安把一切情绪都发泄在职场之中。

**「The Abusers 施暴者」**

After committing the crimes, Xiaoming Li pleaded guilty to all charges and refused to meet with his family. In some ways, I think he is extremely selfish. In order to fulfill his so-called dreams and beliefs, he kill innocent children and put his relatives into an embarrassed and dangerous situation.

Maybe it's because I'm not in the victim's shoes, I don't think it's right to transfer the hatred of the abuser to their families. Media practitioners should not report the relatives' living/working place, names or other personal information without protecting their privacy, just on the purpose to attract the audiences as well as the whole society's attention.

李晓明（王可元 饰）在施行暴力犯罪以后被关押起来，他承认下所有罪责并拒绝家人的会面。某些程度来说，我觉得他是极其自私的。为了自己所谓的梦想和信仰去杀死无辜的孩子，还让父母和妹妹像过街老鼠一样东躲西藏。

也许因为我没有在受害者的立场上，但我觉得将对施暴者的恨意迁移到他们的家人身上是不对的。媒体从业者更是不应该为了吸引大众眼光就不顾当事人的隐私，随意报道其家属的行踪。


（未完待续）
