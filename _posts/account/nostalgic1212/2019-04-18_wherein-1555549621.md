The Gu Mountain is a famous scenic spot of West Lake, which is mentioned in the verse “Peaks rise beyond the peaks, while towers on towers crowd.” 

As the largest island in the West Lake, the Gu Mountain is a place of cultural relics and attractions. There are more than 30 scenic spots here, such as Fanghe pavilion, Lin hejing Tomb, Xiling Society of Seal Arts, Zhongshan Park, Jingyi Academy, Qiujin Tomband so on.

（孤山是西湖的一个著名景点，“山外青山楼外楼，西湖歌舞几时休”中提及的楼外楼就在此处。作为西湖中最大的岛屿，孤山是文物胜迹荟萃的地方。这里有景点30余处，如放鹤亭、林和靖墓、西泠印社，玛瑙坡、一眼泉水、文澜阁、中山公园、清行宫、敬一书院、秋瑾墓、六一泉、苏曼殊墓园、半壁亭等。）

As early as the Tang and Song Dynasties, the scenery of the Gu Mountain has been well known. A poet in the front rank among Tang dynasty named Bai Juyi had written a poetry to represent the view at that time.

（孤山的美景早在唐宋时期已经闻名遐迩，不少著名诗人都为其留下了传诵至今的诗篇。唐诗人白居易有“孤山寺北贾亭西，水面初平云脚低”，明代凌云翰有“冻木晨闻尾毕浦，孤山景好胜披图”的佳句。）

In the book of ***Search The West Lake in Dreams***, the writer Zha Dai introduced the history of Gu Mountain. Here's some extracts (traslation) from the book.

On one side the water is dark and heavy, and the water is not flowing because of the mountain. The mountain is called Gu Mountain for it is not connected with the other mountains around the West Lake. 

Near Plum Blossom Island, the water is clear and the bright sunlight seems to penetrate the bottom of the lake. The pavilion on the mountain is as beautiful as the island. Against the two lakes, the three mountains on the lake seem to grow underwater. 

The island is home to many plum trees, where Lin Hejing release the cranes. Lin bu lived in seclusion in the Gu Mountain. 

Though the emperor of Song Dynasty promised him to become an official, Li still refused to move to the capital city to serve the emperor. Finally, the emperor had to give up and gave Lin bu a title of He jing. Lin bu fed two cranes year round and usually kept them in a cage. 

This is the origin of the Fanghe Pavilion.

（张岱在《西湖梦寻》中是这样记述的：“水黑曰卢，不流曰奴；山不连陵曰孤。梅花屿介于两湖之间，四面岩峦，一无所丽，故曰孤也…山麓多梅，为林和靖放鹤之地。林逋隐居孤山，宋真宗征之不就，赐号和靖处士。常畜双鹤，豢之樊中。”）

（译文：一边湖水色泽暗沉，因为山形的关系水不流动。这座小山没有和西湖周围的山峦相连，因此被称作孤山。在梅花岛附近的湖水清澈见底，山峦上的亭子和小岛一般美丽。在两个湖的反衬下，湖边的三处山峦就像是倒长在水下。岛上种植着很多梅树，是林和靖放鹤的地方。林逋隐居在孤山，宋真宗下诏并答应他让他做官也没有能让他前往京城。真宗无奈之下只能赐号和靖处士给他，让他留在此处。林逋常年喂养两只鹤，平常关在笼子里，这也就是放鹤亭的由来。）

The person mentioned above, is the eminent poet who wrote the ***Yongmei Poem***. He lived in seclusion and devoted himself to farming and planting plum trees. 

In ***Little Plums of a Mountain Garden***, he wrote "Sparse shadows reflect horizentally and tiltly in the clear and shallow water, and scented fragrance floats around under the dusk moon." The poem was such extraordinary that caused a sensation in the poetry circle, since then no one else can surpass.

（这里面提到的林和靖，便是以杰出的咏梅诗词闻名于世的著名诗人林逋。他隐居孤山躬耕农桑并大量植梅，写出了不少咏梅佳句。其中《山园小梅》那句“疏影横斜水清浅，暗香浮动月黄昏”在诗词界引起了轰动，自此以后再无第二人能够超越。）
