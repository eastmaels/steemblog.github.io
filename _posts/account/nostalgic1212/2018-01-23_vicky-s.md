<p>上一篇正儿八经的影片结束后，终于可以自由自在的碎碎念了。其实老毛子的影视作品我看的真的不多。想起来就看过两部，一部是俄剧《背叛》（实在太精彩，强烈建议去看），另一部是电影《机组乘务员》。<p>
<p>After that serious movie review, finally, I got a chance to say something others. In fact, I watched a few russian dramas or movies. I can name two of them: one of them is "Измены" (I strongly recommend you to see it), and the other is the movie "Экипаж".<p>
<h1><strong>幽默 Humor</strong></h1>
<p>在《太空救援》里，老毛子除了展现他们“熊系”作风以外，还show了把他们的冷幽默。<p>
<p>In the movie of "Salut7", the Russian also showed off their cold humor.<p>
<p>主角偷偷带着伏特加进飞船，让工程师喝一口暖暖身子。后者惊讶的说：这玩意你是怎么带上飞船的？还有我们不能喝酒啊！！（当时俄国实行禁酒令，且在空间站工作也不能喝酒）。男主则一脸无所谓地说：外边可没有警察在飞。<p>
<p>Vladimir secretly took vodka into the spacecraft, and let Victor to drink in order to warm his body. Victor was surprised and said: how could you bring this thing on the spacecraft? And we can not drink! ! (At that time, Russia was banning alcohol). Male face is indifferent to say: no police flying outside.<p>

<p>与他们俩一同在空间站的，还有一个非人类——蟑螂。两个主角得出结论：在地球的话可能立刻杀死它，但在太空，就让它作为第三个宇航员吧。<p>
<p>Along with them in the space station, there is a non-human --- a cockroache. These two guys concluded that they might kill it immediately on earth, but in space, let it be the third astronaut.<p>
<p>男主曾和他的妻子说：如果自己从太空掉到印度（我记得不是很清楚地点），他要给当地人讲太空讲苏联的生活。妻子问：苏联是什么样的？男主说：妻子、女儿、足球，和建设共产主义——这TM的政治正确了！<p>
<p>Vladimir ever said to his wife: If he fell from space to India (I do not remember it clearly), he would tell the locals about the life of the Soviet Union and the aerospace. The wife asked: What is the Soviet Union? The man said: wife, daughter, football, and building communism - How damn correct politics it is !<p>

<h1><strong>“灵异事件” Supernatural Event Humor</strong></h1>
<p>电影最后有一段宇航员“看见天使”的情节，与片头形成呼应。这也是真实的，是人类历史上的未解之谜之一。<p>
<p>The movie ends with a scene of astronauts "see the angels" , and the film echoes. This is the truth, which is one of the unsolved mysteries in human history.<p>
<p>这次事件被称为“礼炮七号灵异事件”。This is called"the&nbsp;supernatural event of Salut7"当时，一共6名宇航员看到“天使”突然出现在太空站周围。紧接着，他们整个人便处于一种非常舒服平和的状态。<p>
<p>At that time, there're six astronauts claimed that the saw the "angel" suddenly appeared around the space station and they were in a very comfortable and peaceful state.<p>
<p>这起事件持续发酵，有人说是UFO，有人说是灵异现象，也有人说是他们因为缺氧或者紧张造成的幻觉，甚至有人说他们都在说谎。只是，宇航员都是经过严格训练的，让6个人同时产生幻觉或者全部编造谎言，几乎是不可能的。<p>
<p>Some people said that maybe it was UFO, while someone believed that it is a supernatural phenomenon. Some people said that they are hallucinations caused by lacking of oxygen or just too much tension, &nbsp;even more, the others said that the astronauts were lying. However, astronauts are strictly trained, it is impossible that all of them simultaneously hallucinate or make up lies.<p>
<p>《太空救援》用这一个细节来呼应当时的真实情况，并且结尾虚构了两位宇航员修好空间站之后“天使”再度降临的情节，实际上就是暗示“奇迹的存在”。<p>
<p>"Salut7" used this detail to echo the real situation at the time, and ends up with a fictional "angel" scenario after two astronauts repaired the space station. I think, the movie just wanna to express the existence of a miracle.<p>
<h1><strong>电影水平   Level of movie</strong></h1>
<p>俄罗斯的电影制作水准在本片中也得到了充分的体现。无论是广阔无垠的宇宙，蔚蓝宁静的地球，失重状态下的空间站，还是那些飞舞的冰晶，晶莹的水珠，都以一种细腻的手法在电影中呈现出来。<p>
<p>Russia's film production standards has also been fully reflected in this film. The vast expanse of the universe, the blue and tranquil earth, the space station under weightlessness, the flying ice crystals, and crystal water droplets, are presented in a delicate way in the movie.<p>
<p>但值得一提，国内院线引入的大部分是英语版，少量国语版。但请注意，真正的原版是俄语的。从时长来看，原版为111分钟，院线版为104分钟。各种取舍，客官自便啦。<p>
<p>However, it is worth mentioning that most of the domestic cinemas screen English version and a few in Mandarin, but the real original is in Russian. From the view of length, the original is 111 minutes, while the domestic cinema version is 104 minutes.</p>
