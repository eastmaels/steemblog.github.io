When I finished watching *Goblin* (쓸쓸하고 찬란하神 - 도깨비), I went to review all of Gong Yoo's previous movies and TV dramas, such as *Silenced* (도가니‎), *Train to Busan* (부산행‎), *A Man and A Woman* (남과여‎) and *Coffee Prince 1st Shop* (커피프린스1호점‎). 

After watching these, I happened to find his first work after he returned from the military service and the drama's name is ***BIG*** (빅). The rating score on douban was only 6.6 which made me feel too curious to start watch this drama.

**Seo Yoon-jae** (starred Gong Yoo) is a thirty year old doctor who met with **Gil Da-ran** (starred Lee Min-jung) at his friend's wedding party. He fell in love with Gil Da-ran immediately for her pure characteristic. 

After about one year's dating, they were engaged under the blessing of each other's parents. Unfortunately, Seo Yoon-jae suffered an accident on his way to meet his fiancee and transferred his spirit with **Kang Kyung-joon** (starred Gong Yoo/Shin Won-ho), who is a switch-school-student of Gil Da-ran's working high school. 

Since then, KKJ is a man whose appearance is mature while with childish minds inside. Gil Da-ran had to accept the reality and began a complicated postnuptially life.

Gong Yoos acting ability is fully confirmed in the TV series, for he transforms between the mature doctor and the naive high school student fluently. At the same time, this Korean drama also gives us some tips about how to behave in a relationship.

Highly recommend you guys to watch this!!! 

在看完《孤单又灿烂的神：鬼怪》以后，我又去看了孔侑在此之前的所有影视作品，其中有《熔炉》、《釜山行》、《男与女》以及《咖啡王子一号店》。在看完这些剧集之后，我发现孔侑兵役回归之后的第一部作品《BIG 빅》。豆瓣评分仅为6.6分，作为他的粉丝好奇心使得我打开这部剧集。

三十岁的医生**徐允在**（孔侑 饰）在朋友的婚礼上遇到了花店工作人员**吉多兰**（李珉廷 饰），因为她迷糊又真实的性格徐允在对她一见钟情。一年多后他们在彼此父母的祝福之下订婚，但是徐允在去找吉多兰的路上发生车祸，与她学校新来的转校生**姜景俊**（申原昊 饰）灵魂互换。至此，表面三十岁的大叔内心却是十八岁的少年（我们简称其为KKJ）。吉多兰不得不接受现实，开始了复杂的“三人”生活。

孔侑的演技在这部电视剧中得到了充分的印证，一会儿是成熟的医生一会儿是幼稚的男高中生，他对这两个角色的诠释和把控都做的非常得当。与此同时，这部韩剧里面还有教给大家很多恋爱秘籍噢！
