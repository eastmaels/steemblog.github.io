As Duoduo got older, she become more and more lethargic. She usually fell asleep at seven or eight o'clock in the evening while she didn't want to get up at seven as she used to. 

We were still rushing about for our own life in these days. Everyday, we got up and went to work for the whole day. When we got home from wok, we simply sat down and had supper. After that, we preferred to plan electronic tolls such as iPhone, iPad or computers for the leisure time.

Sometimes Duoduo would run up to our legs and scratched as if she wished we'd spend more time with her. However, most of time we just touched her head or held her in our arms for a while and then went on our own business.

Every time when I think of this details, I'm regret to death that I haven't spend enough time keeping company with her. She doesn't require for something big, I think. She wanna us to play with her or just hold her in our arms or kiss her. 

「中文部分」

后来多多上了年纪，本就不是很好动的她变得越来越嗜睡。她常常七八点就入睡，第二天七八点还不愿意起床。我们依然为了自己的生活奔波着，每天匆匆出门上班回家以后就管自己玩手机看电视。有时候她会跑到我或者妈妈的腿边，爪子搭在我们大腿上挠挠我们，似乎在希望我们多花点时间陪伴她。然而，我们大多数时候只是摸摸她的头或者抱一会儿她后又忙自己的事去了。

现在想来，没有尽可能多的花时间陪她大概是我们最后悔的事情。


（未完待续）
