我是一个非常喜欢做手工的人，之前也送给长老一下自己做的小挂件钥匙扣之类的东西。这点让长老非常不解：为何要折腾？把专业的事让专业的人做，享受消费的乐趣，不是更好？

I am very fond of making things and I've sent several small things to my friend, such as key chain. This makes him fell very puzzled: why bother? Wouldn't it be better to let professional people do the professional thing and enjoy the fun of consumption?

哼，你不懂我们乐趣！！

Emmmm, you don't know our fun!!!

几个月前看到微博“做个东西”的博主（应该和“日食记”是一个工作室的），放出流沙画的教程，非常喜欢。买来材料包，今天动手做了一个。

A few months ago, I saw the blogger "make something" (should be a studio with "solar eclipse"), who released a course of quicksand painting. I like it very much. and then bought the material bag. Today I prepare to do it.

所需材料：防腐剂、增稠剂、洗洁精、氧化铝、黑金沙、彩砂、锉刀、画框、亚克力浇水、亚克力条、亚克力板、美工刀、针筒、水

Materials: preservative, thickener, detergent, alumina, black sand, color sand, file, picture frame, acrylic water, acrylic sheet, acrylic board, art knife, needle tube, water (the translation of materials are not so accurate).

然后就是按照教程操作，有兴趣的同学可以上微博去看。

If you're interested about it, you can go to the blog and follow the steps.

最后做出来的成品是这样的

Here it is.

有几点小诀窍：

1、亚克力条一定要刚和亚克力板密合，不要超出，不然会塞不进木框里面；

2、多放白色沙子，少放黑色的，不然画面会变的很清奇；

3、注入液体的时候，要计算沙子浸湿的程度；

4、建议买小号的注射器，一般材料包里配送的太大了，非常难操作；

5、操作胶水的时候一定要很小心，一不小心就会像我这样，手指伤痕累累中，泪目；

6、洗洁精放的量，要保证可以摇得出泡沫；

7、最后一条也是最重要的一条，把你宝贝的电脑和手机拿的远一点！！！默默流泪去处理mac上的胶水了...

There are a few tips:

1. The acrylic sheet must be close to the acrylic sheet and not exceed it, otherwise it will not fit into the wooden frame;

2. Put more white sand, less black, otherwise the picture will be very strange;

3. When injecting liquid, calculate the degree of sand wetting;

4. It is recommended to buy a small syringe, which is too large to be delivered in the general material package.

5. Be careful when you operate the glue. If you are not careful, you will be like me.

6. The amount of liquid detergent should be guaranteed to shake the foam;

7. The last and most important thing is that keep your precious computer and mobile phone far away from your desk!!! Otherwise, you'll like....I have to deal with the glue which stick on my Mac....emmmm...

胆大心细，你也可以做出来的。祝你好运～
