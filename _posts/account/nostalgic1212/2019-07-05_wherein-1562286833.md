During the Dragon Boat Festival, a new member came to our family. His name is Lala and he's a rabbit. Later, there're more members in my home. They're Douou (Golden Hamster), Little Guigui (Brazilian Turtle), Bean (Mynah) and some golden fish.

Duodou would often sit on the ground for hours with her eyes locked against Lala. The puppy, rabbit and the hamster are very fond of cupcakes. When my mother was sitting on the sofa eating a snack, these two kids would run up to her. They would put their hands on my mother's lap side by side and beg for food. Even more, they'll protest if my mother's motion is a little bit slower. At that time, the poor little hamster can only grasp the cage looking out at her brother and sister eat the goodies...

Because of them, my parents' life becomes colorful, not boring at least. Although since these little guys settled down in my family, my parents would not be able to travel freely. However, the happiness is much more than the inconvenience.  Every time I call home from the university, I can feel that my parents are not lonely at all.

Duoduo and my mother shared a very good relationship, even the neighbors will treat Duoduo as the second daughter of our family

If my mother is on duty, she will take Duoduo to the workplace with her. What's more, the canteen aunt in my mom's work unit will prepare lunch for the little girl. When my mother's colleagues greet to her, they will ask "How's everything going with Duouo" instead of "What's up with Bingbing". When it comes to the holidays, I'm the driver who take them to have a trip and the photographer who take pictures for them.

Duoduo doesn't like to go to pet shops for hairdressing, so my mother and I learned to cut her nails and trim her hair. Proudly to say, we may have reached the level of semi-professional.

「中文部分」

大二端午节前后，家里迎来了一个新成员**拉拉**（兔子君），再后来又有了**豆豆**（虎纹亮毛缎子熊）、**小龟龟**（巴西龟）、**憨豆**（八哥）和一鱼缸的金鱼，每天回家都感觉自己生活在动物世界。

多多经常会像这样在地上和拉拉四目相对地坐着，这一待就是好几个小时。这两个贪吃鬼特别喜欢小蛋糕，还有那只虎纹亮毛缎子熊。妈妈坐在沙发上偷吃零食的时候，两个机灵鬼会马上跑去她身边。他们各自趴在妈妈的大腿上讨要好吃的，慢一点儿都不行，可怜那只小仓鼠只能手抓笼子眼巴巴的看着外面的两只吃好吃的…

因为他们的存在，空巢老人的父母生活变得不那么无聊。虽然不能自由的出门去旅游，但每次在学校打电话回家都能感觉到两位老人并不寂寞。

妈妈和多多的感情非常好，邻居看到了也都会说多多是妈妈的小女儿。

如果妈妈值班，会带着多多一起去单位，连食堂阿姨都会专门给小家伙准备午饭；几年下来，单位同事和妈妈打招呼问的也从“冰冰最近怎么样”变成“多多最近怎么样”；如果遇到假期，我就是负责带她们俩到处去玩的柴可夫斯基和给她们拍照片的专属摄影师。

多多不喜欢去宠物店做美容，为此我和妈妈学会一身给她剪指甲和修理毛发的本事，可以说是半专业级别的了。
