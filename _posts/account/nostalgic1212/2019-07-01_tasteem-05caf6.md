The Hefang Street and Drum Tower near Zhonghe Road in Hangzhou are popular with both local and foreign tourists. There are a variety of specialties here and has a long history of thousand years of cultural deposits. 

In 1938, Hangzhou was appointed as the capital of the Southern Song Dynasty and changed its name to Lin 'an. The South Imperial Street on Hefang Street is actually the road which emperor worship ancestors went through.

If my friends come to Hangzhou and want to try some Hangzhou cuisine, my first choice must be the **Huang Faner (Wang Ruixing) Restaurant** located near the South Imperial Street.
