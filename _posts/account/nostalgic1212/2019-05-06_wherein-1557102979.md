During the activity, I saw some of the parents chatting with the teachers, approximately discussing the further development direction of their children. In fact, the art character has been extra points during the examinations 20 years ago. When I entered the examination in primary school, I also enjoyed this policy. 

However, the students are under so heavy academic pressure in nowadays. It's really quite a hard work for them to learn some art courses that can earn extra points.

在活动期间，我看到有不少家长在和辅导老师聊天，大概是在针对孩子的进一步培养方向做讨论吧。其实在二十年前，艺术特长就已经是加分项了，当年我升学考试的时候也享受过这个政策。只是现在的学生课业压力那么大，还要学习可以加分的艺术课程，真的是有些辛苦的。

The main theme in these work is Chrysanthemum and Carnation, and the color is very beautiful. I would like to suggest the parents to take the children to learn calligraphy brush, for the signature of traditional Chinese painting occupies a relatively important position.

菊花和康乃馨，配色很漂亮。如果有可能的话，想建议孩子的家长带着小朋友去学习一下毛笔书法，因为国画中落款占据着比较重要的地位。

Apart from the flowers, there are also watercolor painting as well as the gouache of birds, fish and insects. The animals are so lifelike and the landscape paintings are so artistic. I believed that the children, parents and their teachers must have paid much endeavor on this activity. 

I can't help supposing that if I have a child, I would let them to have one or two hobbies. After all, hobbies are able to add happiness into our life.

现场除了一些花卉以外，还有「鸟·鱼·虫」的水彩水粉画（我分不出）。动物画得栩栩如生，山水画也颇有意境，想必孩子、家长和老师都没少花心思在这些上面。如果以后我也有孩子的话，应该也会培养她/他一两个兴趣爱好。

毕竟，光是念书的人生该多么无聊啊。

I'm sorry for taking a slightly skewed picture of the shrimp. There were so many people in the lobby that it was really hard to find an angle to take a picture without anyone standing before it. As I passed this picture, I couldn't help admitting that:

"Well, it's much better than what I drew in the primary school."

原谅这张虾的照片我拍的有些歪斜了，现场的人特别多，要找到一个没人挡着的角度拍照真的非常难…在经过这张画的时候，我不禁感叹道：

「嗯，的确比我当年画的好。难怪当年老师说我画的像泥鳅，这下子我算是服气了。」

I feel satisfied for we ate the delicious food that we marked for a long time, and enjoyed the talented children's paitings by accident. 

I'm fond of taking photos with my friends to record my life. In the past days, I used to take photos and post a few remarks in my social account. Thanks to these blockchain content platforms, I would be able to record the beautiful things in my life for a long time.

I wanna to share with you guys many delicious food as well as the interesting places in Hangzhou in the future. I hope you would like it :D

一天下来感觉非常充实，吃了想吃的美食还看了小朋友们的画作，特别喜欢和朋友一起拍照记录生活的方式。以前只会拍照以后发个朋友圈备注上几句话，多亏了有这些区块链内容平台，给了我一个可以长期记录生活中美好事物的地方。

今后我还会分享给大家很多杭州好吃好玩的地方，希望大家能够喜欢:D
