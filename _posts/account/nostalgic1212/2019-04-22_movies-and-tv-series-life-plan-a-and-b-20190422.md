It's a Taiwanese TV series in 2016 that tells the story of two very different choices made by the heroine in a parallel world. 

The scriptwriter of this drama is Mag Hsu. She has successively written many high score movies and TV series, such as ***In Time With You***, ***Meteor Garden***, ***MARS*** as well as the ***Dear EX***.

The TV series stars Rainie Yang, Keennny Yen and Johnny Lu Sze-Ming as the leading role. In addition to the heroine, I'm not familiar with the other actors. In my impression, Rainie Yang's acting and singing skills are not very good, so I had reservations before watching this TV series.

I think it is necessary to tell the story of Life Plan A and B at first.

Zheng Ruwei and Tang Youyan met in the convenience store, and became a lovely couple for many years. One day, Zheng Ruwei got a very good promotion opportunity. The downside is that she needs to leave Taiwan and move to Shanghai to work for a few years.

It means that the couple, who are planning to get married, have to start a painful long-distance relationship. Continuing the stable relationship with her boyfriend and give up the promotion opportunity, or achieve the opportunity to exert her talents in Shanghai? Leave or stay, Zheng Ruwei felt very hesitate and did not know how to choose.

As mentioned above, the screenwriter uses the parallel world approach to describe the problems and possible outcomes that Zheng Ruwei might face after making her choice.

Plan A: She chose to leave Taiwan and made great progress in her career. The boss of the Shanghai company gave her a lot of help in terms of her working ability and the accumulation of human resources. Because of this, she did not have time to make a long distance call with her boyfriend. The couple became increasingly estranged and eventually broke up.

Plan B: She chose to stay in Taiwan for love. After getting married, she gave birth to a baby with her husband. Since then, she no longer has her own space, and she spend all the time and energy around the family. With no money, she and her husband had to squeeze into a cramped apartment with his parents, which adds to the friction. She choice to stay for LOVE and becomes a toilsome full-time wife. Somehow , it seems that love is not as good as she imagined before.

Now we might say that Plan A is much better than Plan B, while that's really hard to be defined. If you have the ability to predict the future, will you have the courage to live the entirely life?

「中文部分」

这是一部2016年的台湾电视剧，以平行世界的方式讲述了女主角做出的两种截然不同的选择。本剧的编剧是徐誉庭，她先后写出了《我可能不会爱你》、《流星花园》、《战神》、《谁先爱上他的》等多部高分电影电视剧。

这部电视剧的主演有杨丞琳、颜毓麟和路斯明担任，除了女主角以外熟悉的演员不算很多。印象当中，杨丞琳的演技和歌唱技术都不是特别好，所以在看这部电视剧之前我一直持有保留态度。

我想，还是有必要讲一下这部电视剧的剧情的。

郑如薇和汤有彦在便利店结识以后，成为一对感情很好相恋多年的情侣。有一天，身为公司白领的郑如薇得到一个非常不错的升职机会。缺点在于，她需要离开台湾去上海工作几年时间。

这就意味着，正在打算结婚的二人不得不开始一段痛苦的异地恋。是为了和男友继续稳定交往下去而放弃上升的空间继续留在台湾，还是为了更好的发挥自己的才能前往上海历练？离开还是留下，郑如薇很犹豫并不知道要如何选择。

就像在上文中说的那样，编剧采用了平时世界的手法描绘了郑如薇做出选择后可能会面临的问题以及可能有的结局。

Plan A: 她选择为了事业离开台湾，在职场上有了长足的进步。无论是工作能力还是人脉资源的积累上，上海公司的老板都给了她很多帮助。也正因为此，忙碌的她没有时间和汤有彦打长途电话。两人之间变得越来越生疏，最终走向了分手。

Plan B: 她选择为了爱情留在台湾，和汤有彦结婚生子。从那以后她再也没有自己的空间，所有时间和精力都围绕着家庭。因为没有钱，她和丈夫必须要和他的父母挤在一个狭小的公寓能，进一步增大了摩擦。为了爱情成为平凡又劳碌的全职太太，似乎爱情也并没有想象中的那么美好。

如今的我们可能会说，Plan B输给了Plan A，但是这其实是很难界定的。如果有了预知未来的能力，你还会有勇气过好这一生吗？
