Recently, I saw a particularly interesting movie named <strong><em>Men Should Have Some Self-respect</em></strong>. When I read movie reviews online, I find that the film also has another name <strong><em>I Am Not an Easy Man</em></strong>. Nowadays, although women also go out to work to support their families, it is still a patriarchal society.

For example: people would consider a man is humorous when he says a spicy jokes, while people would think the woman is indecent when she does exactly the same way. The role and status of women in society is constantly improving as they are more involved in social activities, but there are still many inequalities compared with men.

Damian was originally a standard playboy. He fluently flirt with female colleagues at work and his private life is very chaotic after work. One day when he was walking with a friend, he fainted for he was too absorbed in watching the beauty and hit the telegraph pole.

When he woke up, the whole world had changed. Women do most of the manual labor and important jobs (cook, paramedic, boss), while men are secretaries, cashiers, nurses and cleaners.

Women are in suits and ties and are responsible for supporting the family outside the home. Men wear face masks and stay at home with their children. Women are drinking and watching football games at sofa, while the man is complaining about his wife's affair with his BBF.

What's more, woman suggest that man shave hair clean, otherwise they would have no "sex interest" on them. When the woman finished, she said: "I can't stay overnight, and I have work to do. Don't fall in love with me, cuz I'm a bad one."

When he returned to work, he found that the core members had all become women, including the boss. What's more, the former boss had become the waiter serving the tea. The new boss said some cynical comments on his design, and intended to sexual harass him. Damian naturally felt the great humiliation, and he quit the job after shouting at the boss. He was so depressed that he wanted to have some fun at the club, but he found that men were the pole dancer.

Damian realized that he had come to a parallel world of feminism. With the help of his good friend, he also began to notice his appearance. He dealt with body hair, observing whether his hips were raised enough, and started to wear hot pants. What's more, he is going to work as a secretary.

New boss Alesandro is a handsome and well-paid writer who has slept with countless men. Playing the man in the palm, Alesandro is the female version of damian. When these two similar people met, they were attracted by each other immediately. After getting along with each other for a period of time, the couple finally decided to get married, while Damian accidentally discovered Alesandro's secret.

<strong>Author's Words</strong>

There are many movies talking about sexuality change over. For example, the Japanese hot movie <strong><em>Your Name</em></strong>, the Korean classic TV drama <strong><em>Secret Garden</em></strong>, and mainland Chinese film <strong><em>Never Say Die</em></strong>. There's a simple gender exchange in these films, but the film of <strong><em>I Am Not an Easy Man</em></strong> really deepens an overall shift in workplace, romance, family and social consciousness.

It's a great movie about sexuality change over, and it's better than any of similar movies I've seen. The movie doesn't tell the story from the perspective of male power or female power, or make comments on the current society. I'm highly recommend you to watch it!

<strong>Chinese Version</strong>

最近看了这部《男人要自爱》，觉得特别有意思。在翻看网上评论的时候，发现本片还有另一个名字《我不是随便的男人》。在当下社会，虽然女人也出去工作来分担支持家庭的重担，但其实这依然是一个男权社会。打个比方：男人讲荤段子就被人称作有趣，而女人讲荤段子就被人当作不正经。女性在社会中的角色和地位，随着她们更多的参与社会活动而不断提高，但相较于男性，依然有许多不平等。

男主<strong>达米安</strong>原本是个标准的花花公子。上班时，随意调戏女同事；下班后，更是私生活很混乱。有一天，他和朋友走在路上的时候，他为了看大白腿撞到电线杆，直接晕了过去。

当他醒来以后，发现整个世界都改变了。从事体力劳动及重要岗位工作的大多是女性（厨师、救护员、老板），而男人却做起了文秘、出纳、护士、清洁工等工作。

女人都是西装革履，负责在外赚钱养家；男人则是敷着面膜，在家里做饭带孩子。女人在家里喝酒看球赛，男人在一边找“男闺蜜”诉苦怀疑自己老婆有外遇。就连XXOO，也要求男人把毛刮干净，不然会没有“性趣”。女人完事儿以后说：“我不能留下来过夜，还有事要忙。”<del>遇到过渣男的女同胞们，是不是觉得会不会觉得有点耳熟？</del>

当他回到单位，发现核心人物都变成了女性，包括老板，而之前的老板变成了端茶倒水的服务生。老板在各种冷嘲热讽了他以后…<del>此处请自行脑补🙈</del>钢铁直男达米安自然觉得受到了奇耻大辱，反唇相讥之后自然被老板炒了鱿鱼。郁闷无比的达米安想到夜店去找点乐子，结果发现跳钢管舞供客人消遣的…也是男人。

达米安这才意识到，他是来到了一个女权至上的平行世界。在好友的帮助下，他也开始注意自己的外形、处理体毛、观察自己的臀部够不够翘，开始穿着小热裤出门😂更绝的是，他将要去做一份秘书的工作。

新老板艾莉珊卓是一个帅气又多金的女作家，睡过男人无数。把男人玩弄于股掌之中，可以说就是女版的达米安。这两个相似的人，一见面就擦出了火花。两人在不断试探和磨合之后，终于决定结婚了。就在这个时候，达米安意外发现了艾莉珊卓的秘密。

<strong>写在后面</strong>

男女性别对掉的影视剧看过很多，有之前大热的日本电影《你的名字》，堪称经典的韩剧《秘密花园》，也有一度引起热议话题的大陆电影《羞羞的铁拳》。但这些电影中，只是简单的男女性别对换，而这部《男人要自爱》确实深化到了职场、情场、家庭及社会意识的全面转变。

这是一部很不错的男女换位思考的电影，可以说比我之前看的任何一部都要优秀。电影并没有从男权好还是女权好的角度去展开剧情，更难的是也没有对当下社会做出评价。它只是以一种很真实很生活的方法，让观众自己慢慢体会，五星推荐！
