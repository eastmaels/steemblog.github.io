A friend who has been learning python recently told me that he is focusing on the fundamental knowledge of crawlers. I think this is particularly good. In the United States, programming courses have long been popular and embedded in primary and high school. It's no exaggeration to say that technology has changed our daily life as well as the world.

However, what he said next makes me feel confused. He said that he is working on robots which would be able to write articles and will be more effective when they are deal-getting from the platform. So I asked him if this tech would affect his mood when writing articles?

He gave me a negative answer and told me that he had a friend who was both a quality writer and a good programmer .

I don't deny that there are such talented person indeed, while I don't think I am one of them. If I have such black tech, I'll have my psychological inertia, or in some way, indolence. Since a robot can write and bring me benefits, why should I spend a few days collecting materials, writing the draft and then editing it?

I've spoken on many platforms about why we write, and whether we're in awe of the the words or even the letters. For me, money makes me more motivated to write, of course. However, words are definitely not a tool to exchange for money. Probably because of this concept, I haven't made a lot of money yet :D

By the way, when writing the English version, I am particularly hesitant about which phrase I should use to describe the word "黑科技". **Advanced Technology or Black Tech**, which looks more authentic?

「中文部分」

有朋友最近正在学习python，并对我说他正在主攻爬虫方面的知识。我觉得这个特别好，在美国编程课早就普及并且深入到中小学课程中，说科技改变世界真的一点不为过。

接下来他说的一句话，却让我觉得不能理解。他说正在研究机器人写文章，以后在平台上撸羊毛的时候就更加事倍功半。于是，我问他这样会不会影响自己写文章时候的心境呢？

他给了我否定的答案，并告诉我说他有个朋友既是能写出高质量文章的作者，也是个会用爬虫技术让机器人写文章的编程高手。

我并不否认有这样富有天赋的人，只是觉得我不属于这样一类人，如果我有这样的技能就会产生一种惰性。既然机器人可以写作并为我带来利益，那么我又何必再花几天的时间收集材料、书写初稿再整理修订呢？

我在很多平台都说过这个问题，我们到底是为了什么在写作，又是否对文字存有敬畏之心。对于我来说，有钱能促进我更有动力地写作，但文字绝对不是我拿来换取利益的工具。大概也是因为这点执念，我还没有赚大钱吧:D

顺便一说，当在写英文版的时候，我特别犹豫该用什么词语来描述“黑科技”。Advanced Technology 还是 Black Tech，哪一个看起来更地道呢？
