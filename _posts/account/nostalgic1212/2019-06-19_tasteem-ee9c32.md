In nowadays, many subway stations in Hangzhou have commercial streets. Some of them are connected with shopping malls and markets, which becomes a powerful extension of food culture and business pattern. 

After a whole day's work, many people especially the White-collars would go to the subway stations to find a restaurant for dinner for they don't wanna to cook. This time, I choose to eat in the subway station below 501 Plaza.

When passing the noshery, we happened to see this advertising board placed outside. It is a bowl of noodles served with shrimp and pork's kidney which looks quite appetizing. For that, I choose to have supper in **ChiChi Golden Noodle**.

Let's take a look at the menu. Frankly speaking, the price is not cheap as I think.

There're many different kinds of noodles, and the price range from 30 to 50 yuan. You can also choose to eat rice here, and it will cost you about 20-40 yuan. If you want to add some fixings, depending on the price of different ingredients, it'll cost around 5-30 yuan.

After making the order, I found a table and waited for my noodles. ChiChi Golden Noodle has an open kitchen, where the guests would be able to see the staffs working in it.  Besides, the sanitary conditions are relatively good.

I ordered Hang-style **Pian Er Chuan**, which is a kind of noodles with preserved vegetables, sliced pork and bamboo shoots in soup. It is the most local flavor of noodles in Hangzhou. Speaking of this, it is best way to cook Pian Er Chuan is using the noodles produced in Hangzhou. 

I had eaten Pian Er Chuan in Shanghai before. Although the chef comes from Hangzhou, they use the noodles made in Shanghai instead which makes the dish a little bit strange.


(The End)

**Comments:** The taste is quite good, but the price is too expensive. However, I will choose to go the ChiChi Golden Noodle to have a try the other kinds of noodles.
