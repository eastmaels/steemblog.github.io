**「The Lawyers 法扶律师」**

Wang She is a court-appointed lawyer who specializes in legal defense for prisoners with mental disorders.

He makes me feel confused in this play, and my feelings for this character fluctuate with the development of the story. Sometimes I don't think he's doing anything wrong, while the other times I don't understand what he's doing.

As a lawyer, his duty is to defend for his client as best as he can do, and he feels that even prisoners have a right to defend themselves. In his mind, the government and society have the obligation to dig into the things behind these cases and adjust social policies according to the them. In a sense, I don't think his concept wrong.

However, as a husband and a father, what he did makes me feel nonsense. In one episode, his daughter and classmates were restricted from leaving the kindergarten. Instead of accompanying his panicked wife and daughter home after the incident, he went to help the offender, who had restricted his own daughter just before. 

He helped the relatives of the offender to deal with a series of procedures at the detention center the whole night. Besides, he even refused the money from the relatives.

王赦（吴慷仁 饰）在剧中是一位法庭指派的律师，专门帮助一些患有精神失调症的犯人做法律辩护。

这是全剧中让我最感到矛盾的一个角色，对这个角色的感情随着剧情的发展而不断摇摆。很多时候我觉得他做的并没有错，但更多的时候我无法理解他在做什么。

作为一名律师，他的义务是尽可能地为当事人辩护，他觉得即便是犯人也有享受辩护的权利。在他心里，政府和社会有义务去挖掘这些事件背后的事情，并且根据事件调整社会政策。从道理来说，我觉得这一点真的没有一点问题。

作为一位丈夫和一位父亲，他所做的事情就让我觉得不可理喻。记得有一个情节，他的女儿和同学们在幼稚园被限制离开。在事件过去以后，他没有陪伴惊慌失措的妻子和女儿回家，而是一路陪着那位限制自己女儿离开的罪犯在看守所处理一系列的手续。这一晚他都没有合眼，也没有向对方收取费用。

**「The Human Beings 众生相」**

There are many other people in the show who seem to be connected by invisible threads. 

The elder sister of the offender who restricted Wang She's daughter is the landlord of Dazhi Li, who is the younger sister of the abuser in the indiscriminate killing mentioned previously. These two girls developed a deeply friendship and help each other in the adversity.

In this TV series, no one could be able to declare that they're far away from the evil. In most times, each of us is both a victim and a perpetrator who pushes others into the abyss.

I will start to write a detailed review of this TV play after I finish watching it.

这个剧中还有很多人，他们似乎都被无形的丝线串联在了一起。限制王赦女儿人生自由的罪犯的姐姐和杀人犯李晓明的妹妹是房东和房客的关系，两个女生在逆境中产生了彼此理解、相互扶持的革命情谊。

在这部电视剧中，没有人可以说自己距离罪恶很远。我们每一个人既是受害者，同时也是把别人推入深渊的施暴者。

关于这部电视剧的详细解读，我会在看完以后再开始书写。
