My mother and I went out for a walk after supper, and she referred that she saw a baby cat lying on the gully cover in the garden this afternoon. As the article [*A Love Letter to My Dearest Friends*](https://busy.org/@nostalgic1212/wherein-1558311988) mentioned, my mother and I are feeding stray cats downstairs in these years. She paid close attention to these kittens which were born this month and even named them with some cute names.

Worrying about the kitten, we decided to see if she was still there. When we went to the garden downstairs, we found that she was actually still there!  We noticed that one of the mother cats stayed with several kittens a few meters away, but we didn't find the other mother cat (approximately her mother).

When we return form the walk, we all felt that it was necessary to check the kitten so we went there again. It was already dark at this time, so we used the flashlight and found that she was still in that place... 

My mother went home to bring some fish for the kitten to eat. After she finished doing this, we hid in the distance to observe the situation. At that moment, we found one of the mother cat appeared and tried to snatch the kitten's food!

My mother stopped the cat immediately by throwing a large number of fish to her. Just then, the kitten's mother came back. To our dismay, the mother cat also tried to snatch the kittens' food! 

Under the protection of my mother and I, the kitten could barely finish eating the fish. If we're not be there, the kitten must be starved to death in a few days!

This incident made me feel so depressed that I determined to write it down. I remembered that there's an old saying says "Even a vicious tiger will not eat its cubs", which means no one is capable of hurting his own. Although the mother cat did not attempt to eat her child, while the action of taking away the kitten's food is actually means killing it. 

In fact, I've heard from the others that the females would abandon their children , especially the weaker ones, to make sure they would be able to bring up the other offsprings. This is the nature's survival law that has been used for thousands of years. In ancient times, people even changed their children to eat in order to survive from the war as well as the starvation. 

Even though I know these truths, I still felt the cruelty of nature. I made an dissuasion with my mother that we'll provide food for the kitten separately. I should admit that this behavior seems a little bit silly, but we just wanna to do so. 


「中文部分」

晚饭后和妈妈在楼下散步，出门的时候她突然提起下午看见有只小奶猫趴在小公园里的窨井盖上。之前我在[「Life & Activities」给我最挚爱的朋友们的情书💌-1 ](https://busy.org/@nostalgic1212/wherein-1558311988)提起过，我和妈妈都在喂养楼下的流浪猫们。尤其是我的母亲，给最近出生的这几只小猫都取了名字，非常关注他们的动态。

据她所说，这只小猫下午就趴在那里睡觉。我们有些担心小猫的状况，于是决定去看看她是否还在原地。绕到小花园的时候，我们发现她真的还在那里！其中一只母猫带着五只小猫在几米以外的地方活动，而一只母猫（可能是她的母亲）不知道在哪里。

等我们回程的时候，我们都觉得有必要再去公园看一下小猫。此时已经天黑了，我们用手电筒寻找小猫的位置，发现她居然还在原地…妈妈回家去拿了一些鱼给小猫吃，我们躲在远处观察。这时候，我们发现其中一只母猫出现了，企图去抢夺这只小猫的食物！

妈妈赶紧叫住了那只母猫，并在远处丢了一大堆鱼试图让她远离正在吃饭的小猫。就在这时候，小猫的妈妈回来了。让我们觉得心寒的是，这只母猫也试图去抢夺小猫的食物！在我和妈妈的“保护”下，小猫才勉强可以吃完这块鱼肉。我和妈妈都觉得，以后可能要专门花时间守着小猫吃饭，不然她很可能会被活活饿死！

这件事让我感触很深，在敲打这些文字的时候心情非常抑郁。我们都说“虎毒不食子”，虽然母猫没有企图吃掉小猫，但夺走她的食物无形中就是要杀掉这个小家伙。我知道在自然界中，当情况不允许的时候母猫会选择丢弃比较瘦弱的小猫以换取其他几个孩子茁壮成长。

这是自然界优胜劣汰的生存法则，已经被沿用了上千年。在战乱时期的古代，人类甚至还存在“易子而食”的行为。即使知道了这些道理，但此刻的我依然心情沉重。我和妈妈商量好了，以后专门为小猫提供食物并且在她边上守护她吃完。这样的举动也许看起来有点傻，但能做一天就是一天。也许等她足够强壮能够自己寻找食物并且存活下去了，我们就真的可以放心了吧。
