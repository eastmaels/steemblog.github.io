大概上周三，非常关心我写作的长老对我说，你可以把你的文章放到steemit上，比只是放在简书和个站上放有用多了。毕竟简书叫好不叫座，个人站点又显得有些孤军奋战了。花了两三天时间，找出了前辈们整理的新人入门贴看了一遍。虽然很多还是没看懂，但足以让我知道steemit真的不是一个一般的社交/写作网站，不是傻瓜式操作就可以的。
Last Wednesday, the friend who was very concerned about my writing, said to me that you can put your articles on steemit, cuz it's more sufficient than just on Jane's books and on the personal website.  After all, Jane's books's writers own highly reputation, but cannot turn it into money,  and the personal website seems a bit lonely. It took me two or three days to find out what the seniors had done.  I can't fully understand the articles, but it is enough to let me know that steemit is really not a general social/writing site, it's not be operated easily.

在陆陆续续将之前自己站点上的文章搬运过来的过程中，我遇到了个问题。因为有配图，简单的复制黏贴就不行。在书写中，发现有两种模式，markdown更是之前完全没接触过的。这样，前面几天的时间，没动笔写东西，反倒是在学新技能。
I encountered a problem in the process of moving forward articles on my personal website. Because of the matching pictures, simply copying the pasting does not work. During the writing, there are two modes, and one of the is markdown, which I have never touched before. Therefor I didn't write anything in the last few days. Instead, I was learning new skills.

遇到个比较囧的事情。没找到怎么上传头像的方法，求助了度娘，也搜过了大神的帖子。难道是这个问题太简单了，所以没有人问？或许是我没找到地方。当时真的很想开口问群里的小伙伴，大家都很热心，但总觉得，不应该这样做伸手党。大致知道，设置头像处应该是要填写进一个图片的地址，直接把桌面的图片拖入，提示错误。那是要把图片放在哪里？
I met an embarrassing  problem for I can't find a way upload my head portrait. I seek for help by searching on the Google as well as what the seniors had done. Is this question too simple to be asked?Maybe I didn't find the place. I really wanted to ask my friends in the group, for everyone  there is very enthusiastic, but I decided not to be a borrowlism guy. Generally speaking, the place where you set your head portrait should be filled with an address.If I drag the picture on the desktop directly, the system turns out there's error here. I wandered where should I put the pictures.

有天刚巧看到了动态更新，原谅我不记得是哪位前辈，提及将图片托管到http://www.steemimg.com这个网站，速度操作。发现按“开始上传”没反应，注册以后依然无效。换了一个网站http://postimages.org，终于解决了（Image Hosting Website应该都可以）。
One day I happen to see a dynamic update, and I forgive the fact that I don't remember who it was. The author mentioned that the site "http://www.steemimg.com" can be used to solve the problem. It didn't respond to the "start upload", and still invalid after registration. Then I choose another website "http://postimages.org" and finally all problems resolved (Image Hosting Website should be available no matter which one).

学习是一件很有趣的事，也是个自我成长的过程。凡事提问前，先问问自己，是真的不会，还是只是想走个捷径。
Learning is an interesting thing and a process of self-growth. Before you ask questions, ask yourself whether you really don't know it , or just want to look for a shortcut.
