Several days ago, I introduced a common snack to you in the post of [Pan-fried Buns with Beef in Houshi Street](https://busy.org/@nostalgic1212/wherein-1556240500). After the brunch, my friend mentioned that there was a children's painting exhibition in Jianggan Cultural Center next to the shopping mall of Intime. It is not far from the noshery, so we decided to go there to have a look.

前几天在[《后市街牛肉煎包(望江店)》](https://busy.org/@nostalgic1212/wherein-1556240500)这贴中，向大家介绍了一种杭州比较常见的小吃。从那家店出来以后，朋友提起银泰商场边上的江干区文化中心有少儿绘画展，于是我们决定过去看一看。哈哈，想当年我们也是参加了艺术类考试的孩子啊:D

When we arrived there, the opening ceremony was on the way, and a group of primary students are listening to the teacher and the host's speech very carefully. We noticed that there were a lot of parents around, approximately wanna to take pictures of their children for memory. 

It reminds me of my childhood. As I was in the kindergarten, I began to learn dancing and my mother took part in my performance almost every time. 

过去的时候刚好碰上了开幕式，一群小朋友们很认真地在听老师和主持人的发言。我们注意到周围有不少孩子的家长，大概是准备给孩子拍照留念的。突然觉得好亲切啊，二十几年前我在学跳舞的时候妈妈几乎每次都会到场。

The children's paintings are really wonderful, some of them are very postmodern. When we stood in front of the painting, it's hard for us to imagine that the paintings are drew by a group of 7/8-year-old children. 

When I was in primary school, I used to learn Chinese painting. However, my teacher told me that the shrimp I painted was loach, and she asserted that I would not be talented in painting in the future. Since then, I have never picked up the brush.

小朋友们的画真的特别棒，有些是非常后现代主义的画派。当我们站在画作前，很难想象这是一些七八岁孩子们创作出来的。我小学的时候曾经学习过国画，但是老师说我画的虾是泥鳅，并且断言我以后不会在画画方面有天赋。从那时候开始，我就再也没有拿起画笔过。

I believe that the initiate teacher is essential to someone who attach a new thing at the very first time.

这么看来，老师对小朋友的引导真的还是挺重要的呢。

We stood for a long time in front of the paintings of the dogs, and felt that the puppies were lifelike. Even if it is the same object, it will present a completely different effect in children's eyes.

我们在这组小狗的画作面前驻足了很久，感觉这些小狗们简直栩栩如生。在孩子的眼里即使是同一样物体，呈现出来的也是截然不同的效果啊。

I'm especially fond of the watercolor painting as well as the gouache, and these paintings on the round fan is very delicate.

我最喜欢的还是这类水彩水粉画，圆形团扇面设计特别精致。

Many children choose to paint irises/calamus. I'm not sure whether their teachers asked them to do, while I think it's a nice choice. I remembered that I wrote an article about how to distinguish these two kinds of flowers. I'll resteem to you guys if I can find it out.

有很多孩子选择了画鸢尾/菖蒲，不知道是不是老师布置的。我记得曾经好像写过一篇文章，介绍如何分辨这两种花，有机会的话我找出来分享给大家。


To be continue...
