There are some theoretical evidence prove that yellow is more likely to delivery positive emotions, so objects in yellow are more likely to be accepted by people. For example, we prefer to keep company with orange cats, Shiba Inus as well as Corgis in yellow. When it comes to animated characters, Minions and SpongeBob are world-famous among these years. For me, the **Pokemon Pikachu** is my favorite animated character, no other options.

The film **_Pokémon Detective Pikachu_** that was released in May 2019, has been hotly discussed online since the trailer was released. Pikachu is known for his yellow skin, red cheeks and boyish voice, whereas he's actually has furs in the movie version... What's more, this character is dubbed by _Ryan Reynolds_, who provided excellent performance in **_Deadpool_**.

This movie version of Pokemon is not a simple reproduction of the animated version, nor a crude attempt to awake the audiences' memories or sell feelings cheaply. In this film, Pikachu is no longer a pure cute image, but has more human-like personalities and emotions. After watching this movie, I felt that Pokemon are not only cute pets, but also the companions and comrades with human beings.

If you have become numb in your daily life, _Pokémon Detective Pikachu_ is a great choice for you to bring back the happiness. **Let's PIKA PIKA PIKACHU~**

「中文部分」

有理论依据表明黄色比较容易传达积极的情绪，因此黄色的事物更容易被人们接受。举例子来说，我们更喜欢橘猫、黄色的柴犬以及柯基犬，又比如说小黄人和海绵宝宝。对于我来说呢，精灵宝可梦中的皮卡丘就是我最喜欢的一个动画形象，没有之一。

电影《大侦探皮卡丘》于2019年5月上映，在预告片放出之后就引起了网友的热烈讨论。在我们印象中，皮卡丘应该是黄色皮肤、红色腮红并具有稚嫩嗓音的形象，然而电影版的他居然有皮毛…并且还是一个大叔配音的。

这部真人版的精灵宝可梦不是动画版的简单复刻，更不是粗暴的拼凑回忆和贩卖情怀。在这部电影中，皮卡丘不再是纯粹可爱的形象，他具有更多类似人类的性格和情绪。看完电影之后，我觉得精灵宝可梦们不仅仅是萌宠，他们更是人类的伙伴和战友。

如果你已经在生活工作中变得麻木，《大侦探皮卡丘》是一部极好的让大家能找回童真的电影。让我们一起PIKA PIKA PIKACHU~
