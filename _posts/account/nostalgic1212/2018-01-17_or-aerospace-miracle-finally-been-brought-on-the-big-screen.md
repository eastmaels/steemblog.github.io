这些年我们看过很多太空题材的电影，比如《地心引力》、《星际穿越》以及《火星救援》。每一部，我相信，都给大家留下了深刻的印象。今天要介绍一部同样是太空题材的电影---《太空救援》。

In these years we have seen many films about aerospace as "Gravity" "Interstellar" and "The Martian". Each of them, I believe, left a deep impression on everyone. Today I'll introduce a movie that is also a aerospace theme - "Salyut 7".

与其他几部电影不同，它是根据冷战时期真实事件改编的。本次被救援的对象，既不是被困宇宙的宇航员，也不是流落在火星的植物学家（太空荒野求生记），而是一架名叫“礼炮7号”的宇宙空间站。影片中两位勇敢的宇航员在经历了宇宙空间站对接、太空舱寒流、空间站失火、太阳能充电系统失灵等一系列危机之后，最终完成了所有人都认为不可能实现的任务并平安返回地球。

Different from the other films, it was the recomposition of real events during the Cold War. The object waited to be rescued was neither an astronaut trapped in the universe, nor a botanist wandering on Mars, but a space station called Salyut 7. After a series of crises, such as cosmic space docking, cold weather, space station fire, and solar power system failure, the two brave astronauts eventually completed the task that everyone considered impossible and safely returned to Earth.

因为维修任务艰巨，宇航局不得不找来当初因为声称看见“天使”而退役的苏联宇航员弗拉基米尔·贾尼别科夫（Vladimir Dzhanibekov）。他和工程师维克托·萨维尼赫（Victor Savinikh），驾驶T-13号宇宙飞船前去执行任务。当然第一次对接尝试失败了，宇航局的同仁们让他们休息，并展开激烈的讨论。就在同事们打开通讯想要遗憾的通知他们前景不是很乐观时，男主汇报道：我们对接成功了。

Because of the arduous task of repairs, Russian Aerospace Angency had to find Vladimir Dzhanibekov, a Soviet astronaut who had retired for allegedly seeing "angels." He and engineer Victor Savinikh drove the mission T-13 to fulfill the task. Of course, the first docking attempt failed. RASA colleagues let them to have a rest, and did heated discussions. When the colleagues wanted inform them that the prospects are not very optimistic, the astronaut reported: we have a successful docking.

当他们进入空间站后，发现空间站完全冰雪覆盖着（吐口痰都能立刻结冰的程度）。就像开头说的那样，工程师冒着短路的危险，用联盟飞船的蓄电池做了一个“热得快”，加热空间站（虽然听起来不可思议，但真实情况确实是如此）。

When they entered the space station, they found that the it was completely covered with snow (the spit can immediately freeze). As the beginning of the story, the engineer took great riskes and made a "hot blast" with the battery of the alliance's spacecraft to heat up the space station (though it sounds impossible, but it's the real truth).

当冰雪化了以后，他们开始将它们收集起来。当然也正是这些雪水，导致电路短路，引发了联盟飞船化为火海（真实情况飞船并未爆炸，且其中一个宇航员还是搭载T-13返回地球的）。

When the snow and ice turns into water, they began to collect them. Of course, it was also the snow water that caused the short-circuit, which triggering the Alliance spacecraft into a fire sea (the spacecraft did not explode in reality, and one of the astronauts returned to Earth with the T-13).

为了不让美国挑战者号得到空间站“偷窃”苏联的技术，局方决定将空间站击落，带回宇航员，但氧气只够一位宇航员。局方商量后决定放弃前宇航员，并安排了主角妻女与他的对话。当女儿问爸爸：你在哪？在天上么？你回来么？而带泪的妻子最后说了一句：回来吧！这段显得格外感人。

In order to prevent the US Challenger from getting the technology of the space station, the RASA decided to shoot down the space station and bringt one of the astronauts back to the earth, for the oxygen was enough for only one people. The RASA decided to give up Vladimir and arranged the his wife and daughter to talk to him. The daughter asked her Dad: Where are you? In the sky? Are you back? The tearful wife said the last sentence: come back! This section is particularly touching.

当工程师得知他一个人能够返回地球，而队友拒绝他想要留下来的提议时，声音嘶哑的低吼：我一个人活着回去，你让我如何面对我孩子的眼睛，又要如何面对你孩子的眼睛？它们尝试了很多次，想要砸掉传感器的防护罩，从日出到日落，都没有成功。

When the engineer learned that he was the only one who can return to earth, and his partner rejected to let him stay, his shouted with hoarse voice: You let me to go back. And then? How did I look to my children's eyes? How did I look into yours? They tried many times to remove the sensor, from sunrise to sunset, but all attempts turned into failure.

此时，局方的领导也拿起了锤子向模拟机器上的传感器砸去，以他的胖壮的体格费尽全力也无法砸掉传感器，气氛一度变得非常悲凉。

At this point, the supervisor of RASA also picked up the hammer to the sensor on the analog machine. Enough him with strong body can't do it, and the atmosphere became very sad.

突然男主想起小时候和父亲在树林里的夜晚，寒冷的时候链条断了。原来，金属在极低温的情况下，会因为冷粘度降低，变脆而容易断裂。于是他们又开始了尝试砸掉传感器，一次又一次。在最后一刻终于成功了，传感器掉了，充电指示灯亮起，空间站恢复供电，运转正常。局方那边得到消息后，互相拥抱庆祝。

Suddenly Vladimir thought of a thing that when he was a child, he and his father stay in the woods at night, and found the chain was broken in the cold. It turned out that the metal viscosity decreases in the case of very low temperatures, and easy to break. So they started trying to smash the sensor again and again. At the very last moment, the sensor is off, and charging indicator light. The space station restored power supply, and operated normally. When the supervisors got the good news, the burst into celebration.

当美方的航天飞行员看到两位前苏联宇航员站在空间站边上，缓缓敬了个礼。

When the US space pilot saw the two former Soviet astronauts standing on the edge of the space station, they showed their respect.

这一刻，我想，双方都超越了意识形态。毕竟在浩瀚的宇宙中，国与国之间的争端，人与人之间的隔阂，显得多么不值一提。

At this moment, I think both sides go beyond ideology. After all, in the vast universe, it is not worth mentioning the disagreements between nations.

以往我们说起太空题材的电影，大多数想到的都是美国大片，但《太空救援》另辟蹊径的展现了老毛子特有的“熊系”风格。我想，大概没有同类电影，在宇宙空间站这样高精密设备和仪器环境中，用“热得快”加热、用榔头锤、没事还喝两口伏特暖言身子的行为吧，但这就是俄罗斯式解决问题的方式---简单粗暴富有冲击力。

In the past, when we talk about movies of space themes, most of us wil think of U.S ones. However, "Salyut 7" is another way to show the unique "bear style" of russian ways. I think there is probably no film will do such things in the spacecraft with high-precision equipment---heat with "hot fast", or smash with a hammer, or drink in the space. It is the Russian-style solution, which full of captivation.

如果有可能，希望大家都走进影院，去感受这场太空救援奇迹。同时，欣赏浩瀚宇宙的魅力。

I hope everyone will go to the cinema to experience this space rescue miracle. At the same time, enjoy the charm of the vast universe.
