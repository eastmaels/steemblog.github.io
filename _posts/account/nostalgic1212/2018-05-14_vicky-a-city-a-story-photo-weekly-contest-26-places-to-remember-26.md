Hi, steemit friends!❤️
Here is my entry for [A City A Story Photo Weekly Contest](https://cnsteem.org/citystory/@aaronli/special-edition-a-city-a-story-x-places-to-remember-collaboration-26-place-to-remember-winners-of-25) held by @aaronli.
> 这是我参加的由 @aaronli举办的[小城故事相片比賽](https://cnsteem.org/citystory/@aaronli/special-edition-a-city-a-story-x-places-to-remember-collaboration-26-place-to-remember-winners-of-25)的作品。

There is a famous person who has more than 180 pen names in his life. When he was young, he went to Japan to study, and was highly praised for the development of Japanese culture and technology. He had a Japanese sister-in-law, and broke with his younger brother because of her. When the war began, he published a lot of anti-Japanese articles as a author, calling on people to keep the united front to the outside world. His articles are included in the textbooks of primary and secondary schools. Speaking of this, I think you should know who I am talking about. Yes, he is **Lu Xun**.
> 有位名人，一生有180多个笔名，年轻的时候赴日留学，对日本文化及科技发展推崇备至。他有一位日本弟媳，并且因为她与胞弟决裂，俩人分家而居。当战争打响后，他以文人墨客的身份发布了很多抗日文章，号召人们统一战线一直对外。他的文章，许多都被收录进了中小学的课本。说到这里，我想大家应该知道我想要说的是谁了。没错，就是**鲁迅**。

The theme of citystory in this week is "**Places to Remember**". I think that you should remember the name of Lu Xun, if you finished your primary and secondary schools in the mainland of China. Speaking of him,  we're naturally  thinking of **Lu Xun's Former Residence**. This time, please travel with Vicky to Lu Xun's hometown --- Shaoxing.
>这期citystory的主题是【**让你不能忘怀的地方**】。我想，国内念完高中朋友们的应该都对鲁迅这个名字记忆犹新吧~~中小学做了多少关于他文章的选择、阅读理解和问答题，想忘掉都难啊！~~那么由他~~请允许我牵强的设定故居和人一样令人难忘~~我们自然会想到**鲁迅故居**~~我真的只是想找个理由出去浪😂~~。今次，就跟着Vicky去一趟鲁迅故里——绍兴。

I select two famous scenic spots to introduce to you: **Sanwei Study** and **Baicao Garden**.
> 我挑选了两个比较有名的景点，想要介绍给大家：**三味书屋**和**百草园**。

The Sanwei Study has a history of more than a century, but it is well preserved. Houses, tables, chairs, plaques, couplets and so on are mostly original. The owner of  Sanwei Study contributes it to the country. As a important cultural relic in China, Sanwei Study has been properly protected and has become an important open place in Lu Xun's memorial hall.
> 三味书屋距今已有一个多世纪的历史，但被保存的十分完好。房子、桌椅、匾额、对联等大多都是当年的原物，三味书屋主人将它慨赠给国家。三味书屋作为中国重点文物得到妥善的保护，并成为鲁迅纪念馆的一个重要开放场所。

A Qing-Dynasty-style building, the House Complex of the Shou Family, composed of a foyer, a reception room, a main building, a single-storey house and wing rooms, was the residence of Shou Jingwu(Lu Xun's tutor) and his family members. The eastern wing room was Sanwei Study(Tree-Flavor Study), Mr.Shou used it as a tutoring room where he inculcated in his students Chinese classics.
> 寿家台门（三味书屋）系清代建筑，是鲁迅塾师寿镜吾家人世居之地，由门斗、厅堂、座楼、平屋与厢房组成，其中东厢房为三味书屋，寿镜吾在此设馆教书。

Speaking of Lu Xun's teacher, I naturally think of the image who is intoxicated with his reading and always has a ferule in his hand.
> 说到鲁迅的老师，那个沉醉读书、大敲戒尺的教书先生形象立刻浮现在我的脑海中。

Shou Jingwu(1849-1930), was "the most upright, honorable and erudite man in our town", whose moral and meticulous scholarship deeply influenced Lu Xun.
> 寿镜吾(1849-1930)，名怀鉴，字镜吾，是一个学问渊博的宿儒。他品行端正，性格耿直，一生厌恶功名，自考中秀才后便不再应试，终身以坐馆授徒为业。鲁迅称赞他为“本城中极方正，质朴，博学的人”。

![IMG_6394.JPG](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWKinANdnF1tC7CnF6RTsm8oUd51yMjuBKmy6oetw92AY)

The small reception room was used by the Zhou Family as a dining and guest-entering place. During the period of Xinhai Revolution(1911), it was in this room that Lu Xun received his relatives and students.
> 小堂前（客堂），绍兴俗称堂前。此为鲁迅家吃饭会客之处。辛亥革命期间，鲁迅常在此接待来访的亲友和学生。

Lu Xun showed highly respect for Mr. Shou. After he left Shaoxing, he had been in contact with Mr. Shou by writing letters. Lu Xun returned to Shaoxing in 1906 and visited his tutor again. This is the place where he told Mr.Shou what he saw outside.
> 鲁迅对寿镜吾先生充满了真挚的爱戴和敬意，离开绍兴之后，与寿镜吾先生一直有书信往来。1906年鲁迅曾回绍兴，又去看望这位老师，就是在这里给他讲外面的所见所闻。

The tablet was a present sent by Mr.Shou's nephew in 1928, a year before his death. “重游泮水” is a kind of celebration ceremony in the imperial examination system of Qing dynasty.
> 在退堂屏额上悬挂着一块“重游泮水”匾，这块匾是寿镜吾中秀才（入泮）的第六十年，即1928年他过世前的一年，他的侄儿寿孝天送来祝贺的。“重游泮水”是清代科举制度中一种庆贺仪式。

In the middle of the study is a plaque with the word of "Three-Flavor". What is "Three-Flavor"? According to his son's memory: "读经味如稻粱，读史味如肴馔，诸子百家，味如醯醢。" Among them, "醯醢" means seasoning. Under the plaque is a picture of Pine and Deer. The students should salute to plaque and picture before they started studying.
> 书屋正中悬挂着“三味书屋”的匾额。何为“三味”？根据寿镜吾先生的儿子回忆：“读经味如稻粱，读史味如肴馔，诸子百家，味如醯醢。”其中醯醢是调味品。匾额下挂着一幅《松鹿图》，学生每天上学要先对着匾和图行礼，然后才开始读书。

The southern wing is now on display to introduce the history of ancient education in Shaoxing.
> 南边的厢房，如今陈列着介绍历史文化名城绍兴的古代教育史。

**Introduction**: Shaoxing can trace its brilliant history of education back to the 5th century BC when Gou Jian, the King of Yue state from 497 to 465 BC, adopted some effective measures to initiate the education. Wang Chong(27-97), philosopher and author of Lun Heng in Eastern Han dynasty(25-220), started one of the earliest private schools in Shaoxing. In the last years of Western Jin dynasty(256-316) and especially during Eastern Jin dynasty(317-420), multitudes of people who used to live in the central plains of China moved to Shaoxing. Some people among these migrants ran schools in various ways, which greatly promoted Shaoxing's education.
> **《越中教育简史陈列》前言**：绍兴古代教育发端甚早，公元前五世纪晚期，越王勾践“十年生聚，十年教训”，已有积物育人，开展教育的举措。东汉时，王充就读于上虞书馆，后又亲自设塾授徒，为绍兴境内办学之始。西晋末，中原人口大量南迁，不少文人移居会稽，于境内办学兴校，越中文化教育大见进展。唐代，越州及诸暨、嵊县建立官学并有书院之设。北宋，越州属县皆设县学，书院有增，同时出现颇具规模的民间义学。南宋，越州升绍兴府，都市繁荣与文教发展并进，书院勃兴，学塾遍设。历明迄清，文教益盛，更兼名家荟集，学术交流频繁。书院学塾遍举和讲学授业成风，对绍兴近代教育的形成和发展影响深远，不少书院和学塾成为新式学堂的前身。

**Shaoxing's prefecture and county schools**: Prefecture and country schools were places of instruction operated and maintained by the local government. Government-running schools in Shaoxing originated in Eastern Jin dynasty(317-420), started operating in the early years of Tang dynasty(618-907) and flourished in Song dynasty(960-1279). Yuan(1279-1368) and Ming(1368-1644) dynasty followed suit until prefecture schools were revived in the early years of Qing dynasty(1644-1911). Later, with the abolition of the imperial civil examination system(called keju in China) in 1905, the schools were abandoned and transformed into modern style secondary schools.
> **越中府县学**：府学县学是官立的教育处所。越中官学始于东晋，县学创于初唐，至两宋府县学兴盛，元明因袭，清初府学复盛，清末科举罢，府县学废，先后改建为中学或教育馆所等。

**Shaoxing's shuyuan**: Being either government-running or non-governmental, shuyuan(academy of classical learning) was initially a place for revision and annotation of classical works and later used for academic learning and instruction. Shuyuan in Shaoxing originated in Tang dynasty(618-907) and prospered throughout Song dynasty(960-1279). They were still encouraged but at the same time were kept under tight government controlling in Yuan dynasty(1279-1366). Ming and Qing dynasty saw rapid growth and prosperity of the academies in Shaoxing with a multitude of scholars pursuing serious learning here. Shuyuan in Shaoxing began to decline after the abolition of the imperial civil examination system in 1905.
> **越中书院**：书院有官办、民办两种性质。初为校书，藏书的场所，后亦供人读书，讲学。越中书院起始于唐，勃兴于宋，元季倡导并加强控制，使书院逐渐官学化；明清时名家荟萃，研究之风炽烈，书院大盛。清末科举罢废，书院式微。

**Shaoxing's xueshu**: Xueshu(shu means "private school"), an old-style private school, used to be the basic educational institution in China. They fall into jiashu(family school), xueguan(roughly the equivalent of shu), and yishu(free private school). Shaoxing's xueshu originated in Eastern Han dynasty(25-220), remained prosperous in the succeeding dynasties, and was most prevalent during Ming and Qing dynasty.
> **越中学塾**：学塾是古代的教育基础设施，有家塾，族塾，村塾，学馆和义塾等几种。越中学塾起始于东汉，之后，代见兴盛，明清时学塾遍设。

Lu Xun and Zhou Zuoren are both pioneers of New Culture Movement, which prevailed throughout 1920s and 1930s. The Zhou brother helped lay a solid foundation for new Chinese literature through their creative and vehement writing in defiance of the reactionary social and literary system. Unfortunately, they chose and followed different ways of life after "fighting" shoulder to shoulder at early stages.
> 鲁迅和周作人是五四新文化运动中最有影响的代表性人物，他们双峰并峙，以卓越的反叛精神和创作业绩，为中国新文学奠定了坚实的基础。令人惋惜的是，周氏兄弟在并肩作战后，走上了两条截然不同的路。

Walking out of the **Sanwei Study** and heading towards the street, we went to Lu Xun's former residence. Here we will see the **Baicao Garden**, which appears in Lu Xun's articles many times.
> 从**三味书屋**出来，向着古街深巷走去，我们来到鲁迅故居。这里我们会看到他的生平，以及课本上出现过很多次的**百草园**。

![timg4567890.jpg](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVnyAhN1QqBr9xkkW71dUR9iaeGJYhkbxitMgtTwG3tZM)

Baicao Garden was originally a deserted vegetable plot shared by all the residents in the New Taimen(New House Complex) of the Zhou family. As Lu Xun recalled, "There was a large garden in the rear of my house, which was said to be a One Hundred Plant Garden… Although there was, in fact, nothing more than some weeds inside, it was my paradise when I was young." In his childhood, he used to play in this garden together with his peers.
> 百草园原为周家新台门族人所共有的一个荒芜的菜园，鲁迅曾经回忆说：“我家后面有一个很大的园，相传叫作百草园。……其中似乎确凿有一些野草；但那时确是我的乐园……。不必说碧绿的菜畦，光滑的石井栏，高大的皂荚树，紫红的桑椹；也不必说鸣蝉在树叶里长吟，肥胖的黄峰伏在菜花上，轻捷的叫天子（云雀）忽然从草间直窜向云宵里去了，单是周围的短短的泥墙根一带，就有无限趣味”摘自《从百草园到三味书屋》。

This is the place where Lu Xun played as a child. The tall saplings, the smooth well curb, the mud wall as well as the mulberries were still there. Is the cricket still singing there?
> 这是鲁迅小时候玩耍的地方。高大的皂荚树还在，光滑的井栏也在，泥墙根也在，紫红的桑椹也还在。只是，蟋蟀还会来弹琴吗？
