This story happens in the after life world, but it's not as dark as we think. Season 1 gets 7.8 points in Douban, and season 2 rose to 8.5 points. It has a very high score in ROTTEN TOMATOES, which is an American website, mainly providing news and comments about movies as well as TV dramas.

When Eleanor opened her eyes, she was told that she was in **The Good Place**. What is **The Good Place**? Generally speaking, it is the Heaven. Michael, a gray-haired and gentle old man, introduce himself as the urban designer. Everyone in this city has his/her soul mate, and Eleanor's soulmate is an ethicist named Chidi.

Eleanor had a huge secret. She was actually a foul-mouthed and mischievous young woman, who was absolutely not up to the standards of heaven. She tried to tell more lies to keep herself from being banished from the Heaven, but the secrets were driving her mad. One day Eleanor confessed to Chidi that she had been assigned to the Heaven because of a systematic error, hoping Chidi could help her.

Their neighbor is a couple that is equally odd. Tahani is a rich girl who grows up in the shadow of her sister. Her lifelong wish is to get rid of her sister's aura and let her parents and people around her pay attention to her. Jianyu, a Taiwanese monk who is performing his testimony. Tahani is a social animal who loves hosting and attending parties, while for some reason Jianyu can't say a word.

The later plot is quite surprising, and I'll leave you guys to watch by yourselves. In fact, I was attracted to the show at the first sight because it used some high concept to frame good within the first few minutes. Like the SIMS gamer, you start by accepting the game. The first two episodes describe the world they live in, for example:

* Columbus and others were in the bad place because they participated in the killing；

* Almost every artist and past President of the United States has gone to the bad place (except Lincoln)；

* Any dirty words will be corrected to the other words in time: Fuck will turn into Fork, and bullshit will turn into bullshirt；

* Any language will be unified into English；

* Eleanor's "evil ideas" can create chaos for the good place.

I personally adore the heroin Kristen Bell very much. She played the role of Electronic Woman in the classic American TV series ***Heroes***. She also shot to fame and won multiple awards for her role in ***Veronica Mars***.

She is a very good dubbing voice at the same time. She voiced princess Anna in ***Frozen*** and sloth, metro staff and lightning colleagues in ***Zootopia***. What surprises me the most is that she is also the narrator of one of my favorite American TV shows ***Gossip Girl***.

The actress I'm most interested in is the one who plays Janet. The cast list says her name is D 'arcy Carden, but there's very little information online about her. Meanwhile, I can't tell her from Amy in ***The Big Bang Theory***.

**Author's Words**

I have been sorting out past articles on Wordpress these days and saw this movie review. This is my first article since I started my website. At that time, my writing style was not yet formed and my words were still immature. When I clicked to release after finishing, I did not expect to automatically synchronize to steemit.

When I opened the Partiko habitually this morning, I found that many friends upvoted and  left many comments behind it. Until then, I realize the thing of synchronization. Thank you so much for supporting me like this and I am also very grateful for the trust of @steerem.io, which gave me support as usual.

**Chinese Version**

本剧背景设定在死后世界，但并不是我们印象中的阴暗基调，算是一部用轻松的方式谈论生死的美剧。豆瓣评分第一季7.8分，第二季不降反升直接飙到了8.5分。在烂番茄更是有100%这一不俗表现，足以见得该剧编剧功底。

Eleanor睁开眼后，被告知自己在善地。什么是善地？通俗来说就是天堂吧。有个头发花白一脸和善的老头，Michael自称自己是善地的城市设计师，并且领着她介绍了这座城市。在这个城市，每个人都有自己的soul mate，而Eleanor的灵魂伴侣则是一位叫Chidi的伦理学家。

Eleanor有着巨大的秘密。她生前其实是一个满口脏话，小坏事做尽的妹子，按照道理来说是完全不符合进入天堂的标准的。对外人她要极力说更多的谎言来保住自己不被从天堂驱逐，但秘密本身快要逼疯她了。于是，有天Eleanor向Chidi坦白自己是因为系统错误，被分到善地，希望Chidi可以帮助她。

个人觉得Eleanor是那种缺少家长关爱，青春期无限延长的人。她不算好人，但不至于让人觉得讨厌。~~参照人物：We Are The Worst《我爱上的人是奇葩》中的女主角Gretchen。~~

他们的隔壁，住着一对同样诡异的couple。Tahani是个在姐姐阴影下成长起来的富家女，毕生愿望就是摆脱姐姐的光环，让父母以及周围的人关注自己。Jianyu是一位在履行缄言的台湾和尚，本剧的前半段他几乎一言不发。Tahani是个social animal，热爱举办和参加各种party，而因为某些原因，Jianyu一句话都不能讲。

后面的剧情走向，还是比较让人感到惊喜的，Vicky就不在这里多剧透啦，留给大家自己去慢慢观看。其实这部剧会吸引到我，是因为开始没几分钟，就用了一些高概念对善地进行了构架。就像模拟人生的游戏玩家，一开始就要接受这个游戏的玩法。比如，前面两集就交代了它们所处世界的情况：

* 哥伦布等人在恶地，因为他们参与了掠杀；

* 几乎所有的艺术家和往届美国总统都去了恶地（林肯除外）；

* 任何脏话会被及时修正为其他词语：Fuck会变成Fork，bullshit会变成bullshirt；

* 任何的语言都会被统一转换为英语；

* Eleanor的“邪恶想法”会对善地造成混乱。

女主角克里斯汀·贝尔 Kristen Bell，我个人非常喜欢。她在经典美剧《英雄》Heroes中，饰演放电女这一角色。她还凭借主演了《美眉校探》迅速蹿红，并获得多个奖项。

同时，她是位非常出色的配音。她在《冰雪奇缘》中为安娜公主配音，在《疯狂动物城》中为树懒、车管所员工和闪电的同事配音。最让我惊喜的是，我最爱的美剧之一《绯闻女孩》中，那个未曾路面过的旁白也是她。

我最感兴趣的，还是饰演Janet的演员。演员表中显示叫D'Arcy Carden，但是网上关于她的资料非常少。脸盲如我，把她和《生活大爆炸》中的Amy傻傻分不清。

**写在后面**

这几天在整理Wordpress上过去的文章，看到这篇影视剧推荐。这是我个人网站开设以来的第一篇文章，当时个人写作风格还未形成，笔触还很幼稚。当时只是稍作整理以后点击了再发布，没想到自动同步到了steemit上面。

早上起来习惯性的打开Partiko，我发现有不少朋友upvote了这篇文章，还有给我留言，这才发现了同步的事情。在此非常感谢这些朋友们，没有笑话9个月前的我写的这篇文。也超感谢@steempress.io的信任，一如即往的给了我支持。
