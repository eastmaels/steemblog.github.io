对我这种肉食动物来说，一天没吃到肉基本等同于没有吃过饭。对于肉食主义的吃货们来说，没什么比一份肉质鲜嫩多汁的煎牛排更能满足口腹之欲啦。去西餐厅吃饭气氛固然很好，但总有种吃不饱的感觉。

于是呢，我们买好了牛排决定在家里自己动手做一份黑椒煎牛排。

For me, if I haven't eaten any meat a day basically means I eat nothing this day. For carnivores, there's nothing more satisfying than a juicy steak. The atmosphere in western-style restaurant is fascinating in deed, while I often feel the steak is not enough for me. 

As a result, we bought the steak online and decided to cook  the **Fried Beef Steak with Black Pepper** at home in the weekends.

1、将速冻箱内的牛排拿出来解冻，洗净后在砧板上用刀背拍松；

2、将牛排放在厨房用纸上，吸干牛肉上面的水分；

3、在牛排的两面均匀抹上盐和黑胡椒，放在边上静置半小时待用；

Defrost the steak in the freezer, wash it clean and pat it loose on the cutting board with the back of knife;

Place the steak on kitchen paper and try your best to drain the water off the beef.

Rub the suitable amount of salt and black pepper on both sides of the steak and set it aside for half an hour.

4、在等待牛肉腌制的时间里，我们先来处理配菜。将洋葱放进冷冻箱，西兰花、胡萝卜洗净；将西兰花掰成小块，胡萝卜切成小块然后过水待用；从冷冻箱中拿出洋葱，去除外皮后切成丝状；

While we wait for the beef to be ready, we can use the time to deal with the side dishes. 

Put the onions in the freezer, then wash the broccoli and carrots. Break the broccoli into small pieces, and cut the carrots into small chunks. Cook the broccoli and carrots in the water with some salt, then put them in the bowls. Get the onion out from freezer and cut it into filaments.

5、黄油放入锅中，待融化后放入牛排小火煎熟。这时候要注意来回翻面，根据自己的喜好控制熟的程度；

Melt the butter in the pan and cook the steak over low heat. At this point, pay attention to fry both sides of steak equally. You should control the degree of doneness based on your own preferences;

6、将牛排装入平盘中，我们来处理酱汁的部分。油锅加热后放入黄油和洋葱，待洋葱充分变软后加入黑胡椒酱和盐调味；

7、将酱汁浇在牛排边缘，并放入西兰花和胡萝卜点缀，完成！

这样，家庭版的黑椒煎牛排就做完啦，是不是很简单？还等什么，周末的时候一起在家里试着做一次吧:D

Put the steak on a flat plate and then let's prepare the sauce. 

Heat the oil and then add in the butter as well as the onion. When the onion is soft, add the black pepper sauce and salt to adjust the flavor. Pour the sauce over the edges of the steak and decorated the it with broccoli and carrots. 

Done!

Well, that's the whole procedure of **Fried Beef Steak with Black Pepper** in home version. Isn't it easy? Let's try to make it in the following weekends! Can't wait to see your works :D 


(The End)
