At the beginning of the film, a Chinese woman **Anna** (starred Tang Wei) is running down the street in rags and covered with wounds. Since she wants to elope with Wangjing who is her first lover, her husband discovered this affair and nearly beat her to death. He declared that he would kill them both. Anna was sentenced to nine years in prison for accidentally killing her husband when she fought back. 

Seven years later, Anna's beloved mother was dead and her brother paid the bail. For that, Anna had three days return home for the funeral. The sky of Seattle is cloudy. Anna happened to meet with **Hoon** (starred Hyun Bin) on the bus and she imperceptibly opened her heart to this stranger. 

Hoon attended the funeral of Anna's mother. When he saw Wangjing keeping company with his wife and baby, Hoon wanted to claim justice for Anna and he beat Wangjing heavily.

Three days later, Anna stepped on the bus back to the prison. To her surprise, Hoon also bought a ticket to accompany her the whole way. Hoon said to Anna that he would wait for her  and asked she to meet him in this cafe shop when she releases from prison two years later.

When Anna got out of jail and arrived at the cafe as promised, she didn't find Hoon instantly. Finally, She said to the empty seat opposite: It's been a long time.

If the quarrel between Hoon and Wangjing at the funeral is the climax of the film, the cafe shop was the turning point of the film. Perhaps Anna would never be able to figure out the reason Hoon's leave without saying goodbye. I recommend that you guys should review the film ***Late Autumn*** and I trust you would not feel regretful for watching it :D

影片的开始，一个华裔女子**安娜**（汤唯 饰）衣衫褴褛浑身是伤的在街道上跑着。她因为想和初恋情人王晶私奔，被丈夫发现后暴打到昏死过去。安娜为了反击失手误杀了丈夫，为此她被判9年有期徒刑。七年后，因为母亲过世安娜的哥哥缴纳了保释金，她获得三天回家置办丧事的时间。

西雅图的天空灰蒙蒙的，安娜在前往回家的路上遇到了**勋**（玄彬 饰），心灰意冷的安娜不知不觉地对这个陌生人展开了心扉。勋参加了安娜母亲的葬礼，并在见到王晶的时候狠狠教训了一顿对方。三天过去，安娜踏上了返回监狱的汽车，不料勋也买了车票一路陪同。在车上，勋对安娜说会等她，等她两年出狱后两人就在这个咖啡厅再见。

两年后，安娜出狱如约到了那个咖啡厅，对着对面空荡荡的座位说了句：好久不见。

如果说葬礼上勋和王晶的争吵是影片的高潮，那么汽车临时停靠的那家咖啡厅则是整部影片虐心的转折点。因为安娜怎么也想不明白，说好要等他的勋为什么会不辞而别。这个周末，冰冰推荐大家去重温一下这部电影，你不会后悔的:D
