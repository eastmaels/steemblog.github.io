The movie ***Hello, Mrs. Money*** is adapted from a famous foreign stage play ***Charlie's Aunt***. Combined with the rich stage experience of **Mahua FunAge Team**, this film becomes a very successful comedy. In the process of watching the film, it is not difficult for the audience to find that the film is very complete in both scenario structure and characters' motivation. Meanwhile, *Hello, Mrs. Money* is in an appropriate rhythm sensation

Of course, there are some shortages in *Hello, Mrs. Money*. There're many details are too objectified to women and too much vulgar sexual innuendo in the film. In addition, the movie also has the problems of "Low Tactile Impression", "Exaggerated Color Matching", "Coarse Lines and Scenes Transferring" and so on. Besides, *Hello, Mrs. Money* is too weak in the story itself!

Whereas, *Hello, Mrs. Money* is a great attempt by Chinese films in the field of sexual comedy. At this point, we should give Mahua FunAge Team some encouragement to support them. Speaking of sexual comedy, I recommend you guys to see the movies such as *American Pie*‎ (1998), *Love & Other Drugs‎*(2010), 색즉시공‎ (2002) and *Some Like It Hot* (2016).

《李茶的姑妈》的剧本改编自国外一部知名舞台剧**《查理的姑妈》**，结合开心麻花团队丰富的舞台经验，使得这部电影成为一部非常成功的喜剧片。观众在观影的过程中不难发现，这部电影无论是剧情结构还是人物动机都非常完整，整个节奏感也安排地非常合适。

当然了，《李茶的姑妈》在票房和口碑都不尽如人意是有一定原因的。电影中很多细节过于物化了女性，并且在片中存在大量低俗的性暗示情节。除此以外，电影还存在着「电影质感低下」、「配色夸张」、「台词和转场粗糙」等问题。更要命的是，作为一部电影它的故事性实在太弱了！

值得肯定的是，《李茶的姑妈》算是国产电影在性喜剧领域的一次尝试。就这点来看，也需要给开心麻花团队鼓掌以支持。说起性喜剧，我比较推荐大家去看看《美国派》、《爱情与灵药》、《色即是空》、《情圣》等。
