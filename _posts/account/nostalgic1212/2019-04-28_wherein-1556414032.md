For the films released among the National Day, the audience mainly focused on seven films: ***Shadow***, ***Project Gutenberg***, ***Ash is Purest White***, ***Hello, Mrs. Money***, ***Fat Buddies***, ***Golden Job*** and ***Lost & Found***. These films include comedies, art-house films as well as action films, and more than half of them were well received by the audience.

In the previous articles, I've introduced the two films of ***Project Gutenberg*** and ***Hello, Mrs. Money***. Today, I want to introduce another movie ***Lost & Found***, which is starring by Chen Yao and Yili Ma.

In the beginning, I thought that ***Lost & Found*** was a movie about "looking for the children". Before this one, I have seen the movie ***Dearest*** starring by Wei Zhao, Lei Hao and Bo Huang. 

The touching story makes the film still in the high-scoring movie of Douban. The audience couldn't help worrying about whether the movie ***Lost & Found*** would be able to surpass the movie ***Dearest***.

The story of ***Lost & Found*** is between the female role of Li Jie and Sun Fang. As a lawyer, Li Jie has a crisis with her husband because of her busy work and the inability to handle the relationship with her mother in law. During the process of divorce, she urgently needs a nanny who is good at getting along with her daughter. 

At this time, Sun Fang appeared. This kind and capable nanny almost solved all the troubles in Li Jie's life, so she relies on Sun Fang very much.

When Li Jie thought that things were going to be on the right way, Sun Fang disappeared with her daughter... At the end of the movie, the child returned to Li Jie safely, and Sun Fang jumped into the sea.

From the overall film, we can clearly perceive the progress of the two heroines in acting skills. In addition, the integrity of the story is also good. 

After watching the movie, I feel that it is not a movie of "Looking for the Children", but rather a movie about **"the Females Looking for Themselves"**.

Li Jie is a successful career woman, while she is also helpless in facing the problems from the workplace and family. 

Sun Fang is a rural woman who has no knowledge, no background and no money. She has to face the sexual harassment from the people around her, the domestic violence from her husband and deep malice from the society. 

Zhu Min is a full-time housewife who has abandoned her academic qualifications and career. As for her, she  has to deal with her inner feelings of loss and the betrayal from her husband.

In the 21st century, we all feel that the status of women has been rising. In fact, the living environment of women has not improved. Due to the rising cost of living, many women must continue to work in the company after they are getting married. 

However, in the culture of many ethnics, women are born to serve the parents in-law, taking care of the husband, raising the children, and deal with household chores... 

In my opinion, the living environment of women has not been improved. On the contrary, females are fall in rather tough situations.

Maybe when women no longer need to make choices between "work" and "life", it is the situation that women status is really rising.

To be continue...

「中文部分」

去年国庆档的电影，观众们关注的焦点主要集中在七部电影上，分别是：《影》、《无双》、《江湖儿女》、《李茶的姑妈》、《胖子行动队》、《黄金兄弟》和《找到你》。这几部电影包含了喜剧片、文艺片、动作片等多种形式，半数以上获得了观众们的好评。

在之前的文章中，我曾经介绍了《无双》和《李茶的姑妈》这两部电影。今天呢，我则想向大家介绍这部由姚晨和马伊琍出演的电影《找到你》。

粗看之下，《找到你》是一部“找孩子”的电影。在此之前，我们已经看过由赵薇、郝蕾和黄渤主要的电影《亲爱的》，里面感人肺腑的剧情使得该部电影至今仍在豆瓣高分电影之列。观众们不经担心，《找到你》是否能超越《亲爱的》这部电影呢？

《找到你》的故事，是在李捷和孙芳两位女性之间展开的。身为律师的李捷，由于工作繁忙、不善于处理婆媳关系而和丈夫感情出现危机。正在办理离婚手续的她急需一名善于和孩子相处的保姆，这时候孙芳就出现了。这个和善能干的保姆几乎解决了李捷生活中所有的麻烦，因此她非常喜欢孙芳。

就在李捷以为事情都要走上正轨的时候，孙芳带着李捷的孩子消失了…电影的最后，孩子平安地回到了李捷的怀抱，而孙芳则翻身跳入大海。

从影片整体来说，我们可以清楚地感知到两位女主角在演技上的进步。故事的完整性也比较好，该讲的话都讲的非常清楚。看完电影以后，我觉得与其说这是一部「找孩子」的电影，不如说是一部**「女性发现自我」**的电影。

李捷是一位事业成功的职业女性，但她在面对职场、家庭的时候同样束手无策；孙芳是一位没有知识、没有背景也没有钱的农村女性，她面对的是来自周遭的性骚扰、来自丈夫的家暴以及来自社会对穷人深深的恶意；朱敏是一位舍弃了学历和事业的全职主妇，面临着内心的失落感和来自丈夫的背叛。

在21世纪的今天，我们都觉得女性的地位已经不断升高，但其实女性的生存环境并没有改善。由于生活成本的不断提高，很多女性必须在结婚后继续在公司工作。但在很多民族的文化中，女性的本职是侍奉公婆、照顾丈夫、抚养孩子、处理家务…在我看来，女性的生存环境非但被没有变好，反而变得更加危机四伏。

等女性不再需要在「工作」和「生活」中做出选择的时候，才是地位真正升高的情形了吧。

（未完待续）
