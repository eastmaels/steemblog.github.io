[![2019-06-26 21.37.13.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/06/26/5d13765fd5ae617393.png)](https://i.loli.net/2019/06/26/5d13765fd5ae617393.png)

In 2017, I was attracted by a low-budget movie called ***Get Out***. The unexpected scenario made the movie win an Oscar nomination. In the meanwhile, the director and screenwriter Jordan Peele won the prize of best original screenplay by beating the movie ***Lady Bird‎***, ***The Shape of Water‎*** and ***Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri***‎. Two years later, Jordan Peele brought his second film: ***Us***

The main roles are played by black actors. The frightened face and mask on the poster makes the audience feel terrible. The trailer was fabulous and the fans are looking forward to the movie.

In 1986, Adelaide Wilson went to the beach with her parents to enjoy the summer vacation. For some reason, she went into an underground space. This space is full of mirrors and she saw an identical version of herself! Then she laid unconscious and this accident becomes a shadow over her childhood. 

Decades later, Adelaide returns to the beach with her husband and two children for summer holiday. Unfortunately,  they found four people who look exactly like their family members are coming for them.

These were clones created by the government to control the body, and the research base was abandoned after the project failed. The unsupervised clones feed on rabbits for generations and unconsciously repeating the same behaviors as humans on the ground. And now, it is the time for their revenge!

There are many articles and video on the Internet about this movie. If you are interested, you can find them and have a look. If you want to see a screaming-horror movie, I would recommend you to watch the works directed by James Wan. If you want to watch some different horror movies, then I think *US* will be a good choice for you.

2017年的时候，我被一部小成本的电影《逃出绝命镇》深深吸引。电影的构思和反转使得其获得奥斯卡提名，导演兼编剧乔丹·皮尔更是击败了《伯德小姐》、《水形物语》及[《三块广告牌》夺得奥斯卡最佳原创剧本。两年后，乔丹·皮尔带来了他的第二部作品《我们》。

电影的主要角色均由黑人演员担任，海报上惊恐的表情、面具足以让人觉得背后发凉，而预告片更是让影迷们对这部电影充满期待。

1986年小女孩阿德莱德和父母来到海边度假，因为某些原因她走入一个地下空间。在满是镜子的地下空间中，她看到了一个一模一样的自己！随即她就晕了过去，这件事在她心里留下了童年阴影。几十年过去，阿德莱德和丈夫以及两个孩子再次来到这片海边度假，却发现四个和他们一家长的一模一样的人出现。

这些是被政府创造出来用来控制本体的克隆人，由于项目失败研究基地就被废弃了。无人看管下的克隆人们靠着吃兔子繁衍了一代又一代，无意识地重复着和地表人一样的行为举动。而现在，正是他们展开复仇的时候！

关于这部电影，网上有很多解读的文章和视频，大家有兴趣的话可以找出来看一看。对于我来说，与其去揣测导演背后的寓意，不如静下心来挖掘他为了最后的高潮而铺设的一个又一个隐喻和细节。

如果你想要看吓到尖叫的恐怖片，我会推荐你去看温子仁导演的作品。如果你想要看一些不一样的恐怖片，我想《我们》会是你不错的选择。
