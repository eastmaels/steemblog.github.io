Several days ago, I read the article of [**WhereIN "10 Questions"**](https://staging.busy.org/@wherein/wherein-10-questions-no-2-fantastic-lifestyle-on-steem-share-while-you-travel) that an interview with  @joythewanderer. From that interview, I learned that Steemfest⁴ will be held in November this year in Bangkok, Thailand. It reminded me that when I firstly joined Steem in 2018, the Steemfest was held in the Netherlands. 

The long distance travel and high air ticket price made me feel that Steemfest is an event that I out of reach. This time, the Steemfest⁴ will be held in Asia, which allows me consider the feasibility of this trip.

Three days ago, I saw @travelgirl posted an article [Steemfest 之路 | 計劃、期待和考慮參加Steem Fest? 寫出你的想法！](https://partiko.app/@travelgirl/steemfest-or-steem-fest?referrer=nostalgic1212). After reading it, I noticed that the organizers encouraged the steem users to write down plan whether they'll participate in SteemFest or not.  Well, I'd like to share a few thoughts about it in the following words.

**「Feasible Aspect」**

_VISA_

As a tourist country, the visa of Thailand is very easy to get. For the holders of Chinese mainland passports, we can apply for visa on arrival at the airport or apply for paper visa in China in advance. When I went to Thailand a few years ago, I experienced the application for visa on arrival and the procedure was very simple;

_TRANSPORTATION_

The direct flight from Hangzhou to Bangkok has been available for a long time. It only takes 30 minutes to drive from my home to Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport. If there are no air traffic control problems after boarding, I can be in Thailand within four hours. 

Till now, Bangkok has two international airports and they're Don Mueang International Airport as well as Suvarnabhumi International Airport. For that, we will have more options when it comes to choosing flights;

_VACATION_

By the time I'm writing this article, I still have 5 days of annual leave with pay. If I decide to take part in the SteemFest⁴, I think I will adjust the schedules about the trip to Mongolia in September and the trip to South Korea in November.

**「Considering Problems」**

_LANGUAGE_

From my last experience in Thailand, language is a huge problem...My oral English is not good enough to communicate with Thai when I asked for directions and brought things. I've been lost in Bangkok before, which was quite a horrible experience for me. If I decide to join the Steemfest⁴, I hope I can find someone with good language ability to go with me;

_ACCOMMODATION_

I am very grateful to @michaelcabiles for he offered to help the steemians who prepare to participate the event to find a comfortable and cost-effective room.  If I choose to attend Steemfest⁴, I think I will also consult some friends who often travel between Hangzhou and Thailand to give suggestions for me;

_BUDGET_

If the cost of airplane ticket and hotel can be limited within 5000 yuan, then I think there should be no big problem with this trip. According to my previous travel experience, the consumption in Thailand is not very high. If we don't spend too much money on eating, drinking or purchasing things, then the whole expense will not be very high. 

The biggest problem is still the Entrance Ticket. I have heard that it needs several thousand yuan, which is far more than my budget for the whole year. I wanna to control the whole budget within 8000rmb for all.

**「Conclusion」**

I'm interested in SteemFest ⁴ and I also hope to have a Durian Feast with my friends for they're big fans of this Fruit Queen. If the schedule is available, I probably will try to find a day or two to go diving for I haven't been diving since I got the OW diving license last April. If I don't train enough, I doubt I will forget all the skills I have learned.

I'm not sure wether I'll attend or not, but I'm quite looking forward to it. I hope to take part the event in Han Fu (the traditional Chinese costume) and meet steem users from all over the world :D
