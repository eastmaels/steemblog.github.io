I went to my colleague's wedding on Friday after work. Before going there, I heard my colleagues talking about that the bride and groom had their marriage licenses within three months after they first met each other. 

For the groom is a suburban, the wedding is held in their village. However, they invited the professional wedding company to arrange this wedding ceremony. The atmosphere is quite lovely and the dishes is absolutely delicious. Most of the guest are satisfied with the ceremony, I think. 

During the dinner, my colleagues asked me when I plan to get married, which definitely is a very embarrassing question to me...

「中文部分」

周五的时候，我去参加了公司同事的婚礼。出门前才知道，原来新郎新娘认识3个月就领了结婚证，不经感叹这个速度实在是太快了。

因为新郎是郊区人，婚礼就在他们村里举办。虽然如此，婚礼现场请了专业婚庆公司来操办，布置地非常温馨好看。菜品又多又好吃，我们都超满足的。

期间被同事问及我什么结婚，这倒是个很尴尬的问题啊…
