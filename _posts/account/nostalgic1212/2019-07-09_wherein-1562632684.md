Someday on October in 2017, I heard a strange voice outside of my room. When I hurriedly ran out, I found that Duoduo fell off the sofa. She was panting and stiffing in a strange position. My mother and I hurried went out with her and we drove to every pet hospitals we can remembered. Since it was National Day Holiday so many hospitals were closed for rest. It was nearly noon when we arrived at Hongtai Pet Hospital.

The doctor diagnosed her with a number of serious medical problems and asked me why I had never brought her to the hospital to have a body check. Till now, we could only helplessly asked the doctor what treatment should be done. 

Since she was so timid that we didn't wanna to leave her alone in the hospital, so we went back and forth between the hospital and home every day. I sent my mother and Duoduo in the hospital in the early morning before I went to work. My mother would accompany her to the hospital the whole day until the daily treatment was finished. After I got back from work, I drove to the hospital to take them home.

All our attention was focused on Duoduo since then and I held her in my arms in my most spare times. I keep thinking that how lonely she must be when she waiting for us at home alone. When she craves our attention, we waste our time on unimportant things. She must be in pain because she is in such bad health condition. What's worse, the poor little puppy even can't use words to express her feelings...

Even my mother and I who love Duoduo so much that we haven't noticed her illness. We're so careless that had never thought about taking her to have a body check since she was getting older and older. 

「中文部分」

去年十月的某一天，我在房间突然听到“咚”的一声。当我慌忙跑出去后发现，多多从沙发上摔落。她正以一个很奇怪的姿势僵直着，不断地喘着粗气。家里当时只有我和妈妈，我们慌忙带上她开车跑遍了家附近所有的宠物医院。当时正好是国庆假期，很多宠物医院都是关门休息。当我们赶到虹泰宠物医院的时候，时间已近中午。

医生诊断出她身上有很多很严重的病症，问我为何从没带她来诊疗过。妈妈抱着她，我们只能很无助地问医生后面应该要怎么治疗。她胆子很小，我们舍不得留她一个人在医院住院，于是每天往返于医院和家之间。每天一大早我会开车送妈妈和多多到医院然后去上班，妈妈会在医院里面一直陪她到点滴打完，等我下班后再开车去接他们回家。

我们所有的注意力都集中在了这个小家伙身上，很多时候接她回家以后我都是默默抱着她坐在房间地板上。我反复会想，她一个人在家等我们回来的时候，一定很寂寞吧。她渴望我们关注她的时候，我们却把时间浪费在了并不重要的事情上。她身体那么不好，一定很疼吧。这个可怜的“小哑巴”，却不能描述自己的不适。

自以为很爱她的我和妈妈，却粗心到从未想过带她去做个身体检查。


（未完待续）
