This weekend, I stayed at home and watched a Korea TV drama named <strong><em>What's Wrong With Secretary Kim</em></strong>. The hero is narcissistic and handsome, while the heroine is capable and beautiful. After watching this, a voice came into my mind: Life has been so frustrated, we need such a relaxed and funny romantic comedy to calm the body and mind.

This TV drama is adapted from Korean comics and produced by the famous TV station tvN. It tells the romantic story of Lee Yingjun, the vice President of a famous company, and secretary Kim, who has been worked with him for 9 years. The audiences who are familiar with Korean TV dramas should know that Korea's marvel shows have long been known for their excellence, while tvN has produced many high quality TV shows.

Lee Yingjun, the vice President of a large south Korean company. He is not only handsome in appearance but also outstanding in ability.

For years, he kept the company organized. He is strict with himself, but also with his subordinates.  He'll never allow the subordinates to have a second chance to make a mistake. In his opinion, people can get experience and success by learning and working hard. As a result, the cooperators and subordinates are both afraid of him.

As a colleague, he is horrible. However, he is very popular as a man. Most of the female employees in the company have a crush on him. Lee Yingjun knows that he's handsome, and he often indulged in his appearance.

Narcissistic and handsome, which makes Lee arrogant. He feels that no woman in the world is worthy of him, so he never speak to women or touch them. However, one woman is an exception.

<a href="https://i.loli.net/2018/08/25/5b80d8641a4e4.jpg"><img src="https://i.loli.net/2018/08/25/5b80d8641a4e4.jpg" alt="p2524268170.jpg" /><br/></a>

Secretary Kim has worked alongside Lee for 9 years. All the year round, she can work as a driver, a nanny and a partner to join the party.

The other girl's bags are contained with tissues, mirrors and cosmetics. While in Kim's bag, they are ties, handkerchiefs and lighters. She prepares the stuffs all the time, in case her boss need them. She knows all the preferences and habits of her boss and has an insight into the surrounding situation. She's a brilliant secretary.

Lee is used to working with secretary Kim and never think about her days away. But one day, Kim suddenly offered to resign. Lee believes that secretary Kim's resignation comes from the jealous of his dating with the others. He think that Kim is absolutely falls in love with him. As a consequence, he embarked on a series of pursuits.

<a href="https://i.loli.net/2018/08/25/5b80dd9208309.jpg"><img src="https://i.loli.net/2018/08/25/5b80dd9208309.jpg" alt="p2525268261.jpg" /><br/></a>

All the pursuit method didn't work, and Lee came up with a idea: Propose! Unfortunately, he was rejected by Kim. Reminded by his best friend, he decided to start with what secretary king liked.

<a href="https://i.loli.net/2018/08/25/5b80df19ec351.jpg"><img src="https://i.loli.net/2018/08/25/5b80df19ec351.jpg" alt="p2528324854.jpg" /><br/></a>

Secretary Kim seems to see that Lee is serious about this relationship, so she concerns to accept him. Kim's sisters are oppose to this relationship, for they afraid that their precious little sister would get hurt. Lee does a lot of things to comfort them. Besides, the elder brother is also like Kim, and wanna to pursuit her. However, he's out of game very soon.

In fact, the show isn't just about romance but also suspense. This couple not only been the colleagues for nine years, but they've been involved since they were 4 or 5 years old.

<a href="https://i.loli.net/2018/08/25/5b80e09a5ce49.jpg"><img src="https://i.loli.net/2018/08/25/5b80e09a5ce49.jpg" alt="p2529070182.jpg" /><br/></a>

The Korean dramas have been excellent since the beginning of the year, but the overall topic is mostly dull. In terms of the completion of the whole series, the other shows starts with a marvelous beginning, but ends up with a bad or lossy ending. <strong><em>What's Wrong With Secretary Kim</em></strong> is out of this pattern. You deserve this sweet romantic comedy.

<strong>Chinese Version</strong>

这个周末台风来袭，我抱着ipad在家里刷完了这部被称为是沙雕玛丽苏的中二神剧《金秘书为何那样》。男主自恋逗比，女主干练漂亮，这样的组合很容易让人喜欢。看完以后最大的感觉是：生活已经如此艰难，就需要这么一部轻松逗乐的爱情喜剧来安抚身心。

本剧由韩国漫画改编，由著名的tvN电视台出品。讲述财阀二世、“唯一集团”副会长男主李英俊，和在他身边如影随形、能力满分的9年女秘书金微笑的浪漫爱情故事。熟悉韩国影视剧的朋友们应该都知道，韩国的漫改作品一直以出色著称，而tvN电视台出品的影视剧质量大多也属上乘。果不其然，这剧没有播出多久就有了8.6豆瓣评分，实至名归的高分剧。

男主李英俊（朴叙俊饰演），是韩国一家大型企业的副会长。他不仅外形俊朗，还能力出众。<del>你们告诉我，哪一部韩剧的男猪脚不是介个样子的😂</del>

多年来，他都把公司打理的紧紧有条。他对自己严格，同样也对下属高要求，决不允许属下有第二次机会。在他看来，明明学习和努力就可以获得经历和成功，不去这么做的人简直就是犯罪。因此，每次开会下属们皆是如临大敌、战战兢兢。

作为同事，他给人的感觉大多是「恐怖」；但作为男性，他却非常受欢迎。公司里的女员工大多对他心生爱慕，<del>妥妥的玛丽苏剧情啊…霸道总裁爱上我有木有😂</del>宴会上诸多美女也是盯着他不放。李英俊不仅帅，还自知，常常沉迷自己美貌无法自拔。在宴会上，如果李英俊直径向你走来，千万别误会，他只是想在镜子中欣赏自己的脸罢了。

自恋多金又帅气，这让李英俊很狂妄，他觉得世界上没有女人能配得上他，因此他也从来不和女性搭话，不主动接触女人。然而，有一个女人是例外的。

女主金微笑（朴敏英饰演）<del>你们能猜到，如此颜值满分的朴敏英今年已经32岁了嘛？完全看不到任何奔三了的痕迹有木有！！！</del>作为男主的私人秘书，已经在他身边工作了9年。一年365天全年无休，内能当司机、保姆，外能当女伴兼职跑腿。

别的女生包包里装的都是纸巾镜子化妆品，而她的包包呢？领带手帕打火机，已被各种不时之需。她了解上司男主的一切喜好习惯，洞察周围的情况。她永远行动在老板开口之前，堪称秘书的模板。

李英俊早已习惯和金秘书搭档工作，也从未想过她不在身边的日子。但是，有一天金秘书突然提出要辞职。<del>这也就引出了本片的题目，金秘书为何那样？</del>我们这位极度自恋的男主固执的觉得，金秘书是因为爱上了自己，吃醋自己和别人约会而故意闹脾气。于是，他展开了一系列令人啼笑皆非的追求。

送礼加薪统统不管用，李英俊使出了杀手锏：求婚！结果，还是被无情拒绝。后来在好友的提醒下，他决定从金秘书喜欢的事情开始着手。你喜欢旋转木马，我就为你包下整个游乐园；你喜欢吃烤猪皮，我就陪你体验生活；你喜欢烟花，所有的烟火只为了你一个人而绽放。<del>用吃瓜群众的话说就是——“虽然李总裁的追妻方法没有一毛钱参考价值，但一定会让你嘴角疯狂乱他妈上扬。”</del>

金秘书似乎看出霸道总裁对这段感情认真了，她也在认真思考要不要接受。期间也有出现金秘书家人反对，<del>她们觉得霸道总裁不会对自家妹妹认真，害怕她受伤，</del>也有男主的哥哥出来搅局，<del>但还没定型就被pass，堪称被悲惨的男二😂</del>

其实，这部剧也不只是甜甜蜜蜜谈恋爱而已哦，悬疑色彩也是做足了功夫。两人不仅是9年的工作搭档，而且4、5岁的时候便有纠葛。在这段过往中，红色高跟鞋、长发女子、狭窄的空间不断闪现。<del>一瞬间感觉像是恐怖片😭</del>

今年的韩剧从开年开始就十分出色，但总体来说话题大多比较沉闷。就整个剧集的完成度而言，「烂尾」的现象也频频出现。《金秘书为何那样》虽说剧情过半以后少显拖沓，但完成度还算可以。这部甜腻的爱情喜剧，你值得拥有😆
