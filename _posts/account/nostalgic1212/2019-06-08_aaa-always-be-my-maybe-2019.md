[![2019-06-08 10.58.24.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/06/08/5cfb257a751e675534.png)](https://i.loli.net/2019/06/08/5cfb257a751e675534.png)

With Asian actors such as Sandra Oh (*Grey's Anatomy*, *Killing Eve*) appearing in popular IP movies and TV series, the Hollywood and even the whole world are gradually beginning to like the movies and TV works starring by Asian actors. The film I wanna to recommend to you today, its leading roles and important supporting roles are mainly played by Asian actors.

***Always Be My Maybe*** is produced by Netflix. The title can easily reminds us the movies of *Jeux d'enfants*‎, *Flipped‎* as well as *Crazy Rich Asians*‎.

The heroin Sasha is played by **Ali Wong** who is a world-famous female talk show performer. When she was pregnant, she made two talk shows (*Hard Knock Wife* & *Baby Cobra*) that talked about the difficulties of being pregnant in a biting and witty way. Marcus is starred by **Randall Park** who has brilliant performance in *Aquaman*‎ and *Ant-Man*. In the meanwhile, he's also a director and screenwriter.

We must quite familiar with this scenario. These two main characters are neighbors who grew up together. Sasha's parents are too busy to stay at home taking good care of her. Whereas, Marcus and his family next door look after her, so she didn't feel herself miserable during her childhood. What's more, Marcus's mother played an important role in her life, for she started Sasha's interest in cooking. 

Just when the audience thought that Sasha and Marcus would naturally start dating, they broke up for 16 years because of a quarrel. What will happen to these two main characters after they reconnected?

If you wanna to watch a romantic comedy, I think the movie ***Always Be My Maybe*** would be your good choice :D

随着**吴珊卓**（《实习医生格蕾》、《杀死伊芙》）等亚裔演员出现在各大热门IP电影和爆款电视剧中，好莱坞乃至全世界都逐渐开始喜欢亚裔演员主演的影视作品。冰冰今天想要推荐给大家的这部电影，主角和重要的配角几乎都由亚裔演员担任。

《两大无猜》由Netfilx拍摄，看到影片的名字很容易联想到《两小无猜》、《怦然心动》和《摘金奇缘》。女主角Sasha由**黄阿丽**饰演，挺着大肚子的她曾经用辛辣诙谐的语言（污段子）讲述了女性怀孕的各种不易，这两场脱口秀（《铁娘子》和《小眼镜蛇》）使得她被全球观众所认识。男主角Marcus则是曾经参演过《海王》和《蚁人》的**兰道尔·朴**，他同时也是一名导演和编剧。

故事的情节并不新鲜，男女主角是一起长大的邻居。Sasha的父母工作很忙常常不在家，隔壁Marcus一家人对她非常照顾。尤其是Marcus的母亲，开启了Sasha对烹饪的兴趣。就在观众觉得Sasha和Marcus会顺理成章地开始交往的时候，两人却因为一次争吵整整断联了16年。相遇后的两个人会有怎么样的发展呢？这就留给大家去观影啦。

《两大无猜》是一部比较中规中矩的电影，在喜剧和爱情两方面都刚好够60分。假期还有剩余，很适合看一部这样轻松搞笑的爱情喜剧:D
