<h4><strong>This is Steemit Monthly Author Challenge Day 1's post.</strong></h4>

之前看果壳的公众号，里面有很多鼓励师，对，就是主子们，羡慕的紧。工作到头昏脑胀的时候，看一眼主子们的美颜，即使被白一眼也是极好的（emmm，我可能有抖M倾向>-<!!!）。

When I see the official account of Guokr, I find their colleages will take cats,which they called cheerleaders, to go to work. I admire them so much. When I feel tired at work, by taking a glimpse of the cats, I'm sure that all the tiredness must be gone instantly.

朋友见我最近郁闷的紧，把他家的主子借我玩几天（主子：大胆奴才！！谁玩谁还不知道呢！！）。于是乎，我就带着主子上班去啦，哈哈哈。

My friend found me in bad mood these days, so he lent the fuzzy one to me. In that case, I have the chance to take cheerleader go to work with me.

画风是这样的.....

So...here it is...

讲真，毛茸茸的小动物真的很有治愈作用。这家伙在我桌子上走来走去，咬我的笔，喝我杯子里的水，而我就是一张痴汉脸看着她。有时候这家伙会跳上我的膝盖，呼呼睡一觉。猫咪的咕噜声，治愈能力满分！

To be the truth, fuzzy animals are really healing. This guy walked up and down on my desk, biting my pen and drinking the water from my cup. I just looked at her with a stupid face. Sometimes this guy will jump on my knees and whistle to sleep. Cat grunt is super healing!

背景： Background

主子叫13（本姑娘给取的名字，此后被n个人控诉），2岁，是个小女生。两年前被她主人（铲屎官）领养。

This cat was named by me called 13, which complained by many people, for 13 means crazy in Chinese. She's 2 years old, and was adopted by her owner 2 year ago.

据主子的前铲屎官说：我家养了四只猫和两只狗，平时笼子就放在门外。可能是附近的居民，知道这点的，就用个环保袋把这小家伙包着，给放在我家门口了。本来我也想养，可惜小家伙太小，我家四只猫又欺生，无奈只能找领养人。

The former owner said: I have 4 cats and 2 dogs. The neighbors, who knows that, put the little cat in a bag, outside of my house. I wanna to keep her, but she was so small and my 4 cats really don't like her. So I have to find another owner for her.

从此主子就在铲屎官的家里过着无忧无虑的生活，王子和公主happy ever after～（深切感觉到了铲屎官要杀人的眼神= 。= ！！！）

Finally, the prince and the princess live together and happy ever after~ (OMG...I already feel my friend's kill eyes...)
