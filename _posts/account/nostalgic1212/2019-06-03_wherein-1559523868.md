Perhaps, my mother and I becomes famous among the neighbors for being cat lovers, the neighbor on the 4th floor asked us to look after her cat on Friday morning. The kitty's name is "Guo Bao Rou", which means a very well-known dish called Double Cooked Pork Slices in northeast district in China.

When the neighbor accompanied us upstairs on Friday afternoon, we found out that cat had just given birth to four lovely babies a few days ago. My mother and I felt worried that whether she would became sensitive and aggressive. However, my neighbor promised to us that "Guo Bao Rou" is a very clingy cat with good temper. Generally speaking, she wouldn't attack people around her.

We learned that "Guo Bao Rou" hurt her right eye accidentally while playing with her brothers and sisters when she was a little kitten. The consequence was awful that she could no longer see anything through her right eye. Her previous owner didn't wanna to keep her for her disability and her pregnancy made the situation even worse. As a result, they threw the her to my neighbors to keep.

We went to the neighbor's house on Saturday morning with some uncertainty, and we're surprised that "Guo Bao Rou" is really a super good-tempered cat. She would stay by our side while we're cleaning her toilet, adding some water and food into her bowls. What's more, she would also sit primly with us as we checked on her babies.

The neighbors are coming back in the evening, and we are going to finish being a pop-picker. We sincerely hope the babies will grow up healthy and the cats will not change owners again :D


「中文部分」

大概我和妈妈是猫奴/狗奴这件事在邻居间出名了，周五下班的时候四楼的邻居请我们照顾他们家名叫“锅包肉”的猫咪。

邻居陪同我和妈妈上楼的时候，我们发现这是一位猫妈妈。她在几天前刚生下了四个可爱的小宝宝们，这让我和妈妈有些担心“锅包肉”是否比较敏感好斗。邻居和我们反复说猫咪非常粘人脾气也很好，一般不会攻击人让我们放心。

通过聊天我们得知“锅包肉”小时候和兄弟姐妹大家，结果不小心伤到了右眼。这件事产生了不良的后果，她的右眼再也看不见了。她之前的主人因为这一点加上她后来怀孕了，就萌发了不想在养下去的念头。后来，他们就把猫咪送给了我们的邻居来养。

抱着有些忐忑的心情，我们来到邻居家里。正如邻居所说的，“锅包肉”是一个脾气超级好的猫咪。她会在我们给她清理厕所、添加水和猫粮的时候亲昵地蹭蹭我们，在我们检查宝宝们是否安好的时候，一本正经地坐着陪我们一起。

邻居今天晚上就要回来了，我们也即将结束为期3天的铲屎官生涯。希望宝宝们能健康长大，猫猫们也不要更换主人了:D
