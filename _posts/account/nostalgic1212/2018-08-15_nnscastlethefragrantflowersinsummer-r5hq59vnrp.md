In my hometown, Spring is the season of flowers, while the Summer means green. In my childhood memories, the Summer in this city often associated with mom's ice green bean soup , ice cream cart and the orange-flavored pop at corner stores. What's more, there are some sellers who sell flowers in aluminum lunch boxes along the road.

Most of the flowers they sell are <strong>Jasmine</strong> and <strong>Michelia</strong>. They will pick the most tender flowers in 5-6 o 'clock every morning, putting them in the small box and covering them with gauze, which has the proper humidity to keep the flowers fresh. They will sell the flowers in crowded downtown or scenic spots, or shuttle along the road between the speeding vehicles.

At the end of July last year, I suddenly smelled a familiar smell when I was hanging out with my boyfriend on Nanjing West Road in Shanghai. I found an old woman standing by the road selling the flowers. Michelia is still the same as I remembered. The old woman wore a steel wire in a loop that the Michelia could be hung on a button. What attracted me the most was that she made a necklace out of jasmine with Gomphrena. Red combines with white, which is absolutely impressive.

After a while, I was attracted by the fresh orange juice at the entrance of the subway station. As I sipped my orange juice, my boyfriend walked over and put a ring on my finger, a jasmine ring. That's the most romantic present I've ever recieved.

These are other summer fragrant flowers in my heart, like <strong>Hedychium (Ginger Flower)</strong> and <strong>Gardenia</strong>. People get familiar with Gardenia, while they are relatively strange to Hedychium. On this trip to Taiwan, my friend told me that the Yangming Mountains are covered with ginger flowers. If I have a chance, I will go there to see them specially.

Well, what's the summer fragrant flower belongs to you?

<strong>Chinese Version</strong>

在我生长的城市，春天是百花齐放的季节，而夏天意味着满眼的绿色。在童年的记忆里，这座城市的夏日往往与妈妈煮的冰绿豆汤、卖棒冰的推车和街角小卖铺橘子味儿的汽水联系在一起。当然，还有在路边用铝制饭盒卖花的婆婆和叔叔。

饭盒里面的花，大多是<strong>茉莉</strong>和<strong>白兰</strong>。他们会在五六点钟的时候，采下当天最鲜嫩的花朵，在饭盒中摆好好再盖上湿度得当的纱布。然后，他们会在人流密集的闹市和景区售卖，或者穿梭于车辆疾行道路。

大抵是去年7月底的时候，和男友在上海南京西路闹市区闲逛，我突然闻到一阵熟悉的香味。拉着他寻着香味找去，发现一个老婆婆站在路边，盒子里卖的就是茉莉和白兰。白兰还是记忆中的样子，用一条钢丝穿起来打个圈儿，可以挂在纽扣上。最吸引到我的，还是她将茉莉配上千日红穿成了项链。红白相间，煞是好看。

不一会儿，我被地铁站口的鲜榨橙汁吸引，一溜烟的跑了过去。正当我美滋滋的喝着橙汁，男友慢悠悠地走过来，在我手指上戴上一枚戒指，一枚茉莉花戒指。

夏日香花自然不止这两种，在我心里还有<strong>姜花</strong>和<strong>栀子花</strong>。栀子花自是不必多说，人们对于姜花还是比较陌生的。这次去台湾，友人曾提起阳明山上漫山遍野种植着姜花。如有机会，一定要专门过去看看。

那么，属于你的夏日香花是什么呢？
