我是个非常喜欢看剧和电影的人。从07年进入大学以来，保持每天必定要看1-2集剧（美剧、英剧、日剧主要，偶尔会看韩剧、泰剧以及一些小语种的剧）或是一部电影的习惯。这样的优点是，妈妈再也不用担心我的英语口语和听力啦。作为一个英语专业的学生，我很不厚道的说，大部分课程我靠的都是语感，并且以此坑蒙拐骗了一堆奖学金。

I am a person who really likes watching TV dramas and movies. Since entering college in 2007, I keep a habbit of watching a movie or 1-2 episodes everyday (dramas mainly from USA\England\Japanese, and occasionally from Korea\Thailand and other some small language countries). The advantage is that my mother no longer has to worry about my spoken English and listening comprehension. As an English majors, I have to say that most of the courses I rely on are language sense, which helps me to achieve a pile of scholarships.

和大多入门美剧的人不同，我入门的是《绯闻女孩》。那时候年纪小啊，上东区华丽丽的生活真是让我的大学生活满满的都是罗曼蒂克的幻想。接着就是《英雄》、《越狱》、《豪斯医生》、《犯罪心理》、《生活大爆炸》等等，英剧入门的是《神秘博士》、《神探夏洛克》之类，日剧一时是想不起来了，但是东野圭吾作品改编的我大多看过。

Unlike most people who is fond of US TV dramas, I started with Gossip Girl. At such a young age, the fantastic life in the Upper East really makes my university life full of romantic imagination. Then I watched the "Hero", "Break", "The House", "Criminal Minds", "Big Bang theory" and so on. English drama started with "Doctor Who", "Sherlock",etc. When it comes to Japanese TV drama, I really can't figure out the names, but most of the works edited by Higashino Keigo I've been watched.

如果你问我最喜欢的剧是什么，每种语言列出前三名，我做不到。因为时间的推进，我这周给你的答案和下周可能就会不同。

If you ask me which my favorite show is, just name the top three in each language, I can not do that. With time goes by, I can give you different answers each week.

那么国剧呢？我印象中，喜欢的国语片大多是台湾的：《我可能不会爱你》《荼靡》《恶作剧之吻》之类。大陆的作品呢？我仔细想了很久，在2017年之前，心里真的没有印象，当然完全是因为我阅片过少。

How comes to Chinese TV drama? Most of my favorite mandarin dramasare Taiwanese, such as "In Time With You", "Life Plan A and B", "It started with a Kiss" and the like. How about the mainland works? I think it carefully for a long time and fail to name one. Of course, it mainly because I haven't watch enough dramas, lol...

在我看来，2017年对于大陆电视剧市场来说，绝对是个元年。去年出了三部口碑炸裂的作品：《河神》---玄幻题材、《无证之罪》---犯罪题材、《白夜追凶》---犯罪题材。三者，我没记错的话，都是以网剧的形式出现在大众眼前。

In my opinion, 2017 is absolutely an important year for the mainland drama market. Last year, we have three dramas which got great reaction from the audience: "Tientsin Mystic" --- fantasy theme, "Burning Ice" --- crime theme, "Day and Night" --- crime theme. All these three are in the form of net drama.

看美剧一定知道一句话，网飞出品，必属精品。网飞（Netflix）是美国流媒体巨头，世界最大的收费视频网站。为了扩张版图，它家这几年不断在收集全球的好故事。比如最近回归的《黑镜》，就是从BBC接手的（当然，个人觉得《黑镜》不在BBC的时候精彩）。前不久，还收购了我们大火的剧集《白夜追凶》。

The US drama fans must know a word, Netflix produced, must be great. Netflix is the streaming media giant of United States , and the world's largest paid video site. In order to expand the territory, it continues to collect good stories around the world in recent years . For example, the "black mirror" is taken over from the BBC (of course, personally thinking, "black mirror" is as wonderful as it used to be). Not long ago, it also acquired our drama "Day and Night".

最近又被我找到一部被网飞收购的网剧《杀无赦》，改编自同名美剧《chosen》。目前在爱奇艺上播放了全部的三集，大概270分钟。之后它将会在190个余个国家上映，着实让人期待。剧情类似之前我们看过的一些同类片，《大逃杀》《饥饿游戏》《人类清除计划》《雪国列车》《摩天大厦》等等。

Recently, I found another mainland net drama "Chosen", the recomposition of the american version. It is also purchased by Netflix. Chinese audience can watch it on the video websites and then it will be put around to neayly 190 countries. The story is similar to the movies we've seen before: "Battle Royale" "The Hunger Games" "The Purge" "Snowpiercer" "High-Rise", etc.

表面上，都是营造了一个虚拟世界，以达到某种极端环境，这是明局。实际，却是对现实的一种压缩和变形，这是暗局。就像用显微镜观察细微的生物，我们能够掌握一些世界的共同点。最后我们无奈的发现，我们能逃得出游戏，却逃不出杀人的社会。

On the surface, it creates a virtual world to achieve some extreme environment, which is the bright spot. In fact, it is a kind of compression and distortion of reality. It looks like using microscopes to see subtle creatures, and we will be able to grasp the common points of the worlds. We can escape from the game, but we can not escape the murderous society.

我们不得不承认，大陆最适合拍摄的还是犯罪题材类的作品。但是因为最近几部好作品的出现，让大众开始对国剧抱有希望起来。相信在不远的将来，我们不再对美剧趋之若鹜，而是轮到那些黄头发蓝眼睛的“家伙们”，好好学习中国话，笑.

We have to admit that the mainland is most suitable for crime theme works. However, due to the good works which appear recently, the audience begin to have hopes for the mainland drama market. In the near future, we are no longer persue only the foreign ones. On the contray, those guys with blond fair and blue eyes, have to learn Chinese for the great TV dramas, lol~

另：差点忘了，非官方的，我们的《西游记》、《还珠格格》以及《甄嬛传》在国外也有一大票粉丝呢。

BTW: Unofficially, our "Journey to the West" "My Fair Princess" and "Empresses in the Palace" have millions of fans in foreign countries.
