<p>这几天倒腾手头上的事情，以至于看到的几则消息没时间，好吧是静不下心来整理。看看时间又快下班了，能写多少是多少吧。</p>
<p>These days, I have to deal with a lot of things, so that I can't find the time to see the news. It's time for get off work, see how many words I can write.</p>
<p>1、支付宝年度账单暗藏蚂蚁信用协议 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alipay hinds the ant credit agreement annual in its annual statement&nbsp;</p>
<p>自从关闭微信朋友圈以后，整个人感觉清爽了，当然也有可能是因为不再看广告满屏飞的微博。相对来说，收到到消息就会稍微有些delay，毕竟不可能一直挂着代理看推。依稀记得就这几天老有人发年度关键字：自信、旅游、旺之类的字眼。大概是在本周三，突然推上开始大炒支付宝年度账单的时，一寻思，对，今年的还没看呢。麻溜的看了一圈，除了在这一页看到个奇怪的协议以外，倒是没有看到网友在说的在首页勾选这样的情况。</p>
<p>Since shutting down the WeChat friends, the whole person feels relaxed. The other reason, I think, is probably because I'm not looking at Weibo , which is always full of ads. Relatively speaking, there will be a slight delay in receipt of the messages, after all, it is impossible to stay on twitter all the time. I can remember the words appeared on my timeline these days: confidence, tourism, wang, etc. It was on Wednesday, probably, when it was suddenly on the top of the news, I thought, yes, I hasn't seen my annual statement yet. With a quick look at the annual statement，I didn't see the front page which they're talking about. Otherwise, I found the situation below.</p>

<p>再翻翻报道更近，原来支付宝在发布消息的当天晚上十一点发表申明。原来我看的时候，支付宝已经对脚本进行修改，并鸡贼的把开通权限的地方挪到了我看到的位置。对于她们的这份申明，起码我是没有感觉到有歉意的。
<p>With further information , it turns out that Alipay made a statement at 11:00 p.m of that day. When I saw it, alipay had changed the script, and hid the credit agreement in the place where I saw. From the statement, at leas, I don't feel any of their regrets.</p>

<p>2、微信查看/保留用户信息 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WeChat view/retention of user information</p>
<p>2018年1月2日，一则《马化腾，你到底看没看我的聊天记录？》的报道热火了起来。微信官方表示，不留存也没有权限看用户的微信聊天记录。此前吉利控股集团董事长李书福曾说：“我心里就想，马化腾肯定天天在看我们的微信，因为他都可以看。”</p>
<p>On January 2, 2018, a report of "mahuatan, did you look at my chat record?" heated up on the internet. Li shufu, chairman of Geely Holding Group, once said: "I thought, ma huateng must be looking at our WeChat every day, because he can look at it."</p>
<p>看到有个推油发了一条消息：我昨天回复朋友圈一个朋友——你需要一个男票。 今天微信就给我推珍爱网广告。腾讯还说不偷看我聊天！</p>
<p>Once I saw a tweet: I replied to my friend that you need a boyfriend yesterday. And you guess what? I receive the ads from the love and marriage company！ How I trust you？！</p>
<p>长老也说：我最近在看车，结果朋友圈就是不是push各种车子的广告。</p>
<p>And my friend also said: I'm seeking information of cars, and the WeChat push ads of it frequently.</p>
<p>日常聊天当然用WeChat没关系，哪怕你用Alipay也是你的选择。当涉及到一些商业机密，敏感词汇之类的，还是建议用telegram、signal之类的加密聊天软件，用iMessage可以。</p>
<p>Daily chat with WeChat, even with Alipay is Okay, of course, that's your choice. When it comes to trade secrets, sensitive words, etc, it is strongly recommended to use encrypted chat software such as telegram and signal, even iMessage.</p>
<p>或许有些人觉得不就是开个权限，也没什么大不了啊。也有人会觉得，我行的正站的直，怕什么别人看，又不是做则心虚。这不是开不开放权限和给不给看这个问题，而是首先，民众需要有被告知的权利，其次，民众要有说不的机会。</p>
<p>Maybe some people don't think it's a big deal. Others may feel that I am a decent guy so that I don't afraid anyone to see my things. This is not a question of opening or not opening, but first of all, people need to have the right to be told, and secondly, people have the opportunity to say no.</p>
<p>在这样的互联网情况下，我们需要开始自救，纠正自己的一些从父母那辈沿袭下来的观念。短期内互联网的大环境也不会变的更好，甚至随着技术的不断进步变得更糟。信息泄漏的情况也会一再一再的发生，有心之人会跟全面更深层的挖掘用户/非用户的个人信息。但人是可以选择自救的，并不是没有选择的余地，就看你愿不愿意开始第一步。</p>
<p>In the case of the Internet, we need to start saving ourselves, correcting some of our parenting ideas. The Internet in the short term will not change much better, even worse as technology continues to improve. Information leaks will happen again and again, the people with certain purpose will dig deeper and deeper into the user/non-user personal information. But people can choose to save themselves. The issue is that would you like to start the first step.</p>
