After watching ***The Guest***, I'm fascinating about the Korean TV series with supernatural themes, and ***Possessed*** just appeared in the right time. Don't be delude by the poster I use, cuz ***Possessed*** is not a love story, at least not a romantic one.

This drama tells a story about possession, and the protagonists are the policeman Kang Pil Sung and the witch Hong Seo Jung.

Despite of the sensitive intuition, Kang Pil Sung seems to be an ordinary person that is lazy and full of chaos in his daily life. Hong Seo Jung was born with spiritual power, while she seems to deliberately hide this ability. Because of a bizarre case,  Kang Pil Sung met Hong Seo Jung and happened to know her ability. There after, these two protagonists solve a series of cases about possession.

I remember that when I first watched ***Possessed***, it has rather a high score about 8.9 on Douban rating. Nevertheless, it's only 6.6 now.

I believe the main reason for that is the scriptwriter over-empowered the boss, making him a character that no one would be able to exterminate. As the plot progresses, the supporting characters die one by one while the boss becomes more and more powerful, which makes people feel especially despress. In the last episode, the main characters suddenly come up with a way to kill the boss that makes the audience feel very confused.

Finally, I could help complaining that this actor is definitely the most indecent and incompetent one in Korean dramas that I have ever seen.

IMDb: 7.5/10

「中文部分」

在看完《鬼客》以后，我疯狂迷上了看灵异题材的韩剧，这部剧出现的时机刚刚好。大家不要被我放上来的海报迷惑噢，《附身》不是一部爱情片，起码不是一部浪漫爱情片。

这部剧讲的是一个附身的故事，主角则是警察姜弼成和神婆洪瑞贞。

姜弼成除了直觉很准以外似乎没有什么优点，成天懒散邋遢并且满口粗话。洪瑞贞天生具有神力，但是她似乎故意想要隐藏起来。因为一起离奇案件，姜弼成认识了洪瑞贞并发现了她的能力，两人一起解决由附身带来的一系列案件。

我记得刚开始看的时候，《附身》在豆瓣上的评分有8.9分，但现在去看的时候只有6.6分。

我想，这和编剧过于强化boss的能力，把其树立成了一个没有人可以摧毁的人物。随着剧情的推进，配角们一个个都死去而boss的能力越来越强，让人觉得特别绝望。在最后一集的时候，主角们又突然想出了杀死boss的方法，这点让人觉得非常疑惑。

最后，这个男主角绝对是我看过韩剧中最丑、最窝囊、最没有能力的男主角，没有之一。


豆瓣评分：6.1分
