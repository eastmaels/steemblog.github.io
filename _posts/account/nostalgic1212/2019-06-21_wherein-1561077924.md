***One Spring Night*** (봄밤) is directed by Pan-suk Ahn and he had produced a popular K-drama ***Pretty Sister Who Buys Me Food / Something in the Rain*** (밥 잘 사주는 예쁜 누나) last year. I love *One Spring Night* for it tells a love story between two adults, which is full of realities. 

**Lee Jung-In** (Han Ji-min) is a librarian who worked for serval years after graduation. Her father is the school principal and her mother is a full-time housewife. There are three sisters in the family. The eldest sister is a famous TV compere who married with a dentist. Her little sister has just come back from studying abroad in France. Her boyfriend is a bank executive, and his father is the chairman of a consortium and her father's boss.

**Yoo Ji-Ho** (Jung Hae-in) is a pharmacist and he occasionally get together with his friends to drink or play basketball after work. In his mid-thirty, he looks solid and mature. Well, he's also a single father. 

These two protagonist did not meet in a romantic way, even a little awkward. Perhaps you'll think that since they were fall in love with each other, why can't they be together? However, the love in the world of adults' is not so easy. 

Lee Jung-In has a boyfriend who has been in love for many years and is about to get married. For the side of Yoo Ji-Ho, he has a son left by his ex-girlfriend. The show reminds me a Japanese drama ***Hirugao: Love Affairs in the Afternoon***, which is also full of struggle for love.

What scenario will happen between these two leading roles? This K-drama has been updated to the 9th episode, and I'm strongly recommend you guys to watch this! 

《春夜》是安畔锡导演与金恩编剧继《经常请吃饭的漂亮姐姐》的第二次合作，讲述了两个成年人之间充满烟火气息的爱情。

李静仁（韩智敏 饰）是一位图书馆管理员，父亲是学校校长母亲是全职主妇。家中有三个姐妹，长姐是著名电视节目主持人，嫁给了牙科医生；小妹刚从法国留学回来，在家待业中。她的男朋友是银行高管，男友的父亲是财团理事长，她父亲的上司。

刘志浩（丁海寅 饰）是一名药剂师，下班以后偶尔和朋友聚会喝酒或者打打篮球。35岁的他看起来很踏实靠谱，唯一不普通地方是他同时也是一位单亲爸爸。

两个人的相遇算不上是浪漫，甚至有些小尴尬。也许有人说，既然喜欢了就干脆在一起，但是成年人世界的恋爱哪有那么容易。一个有相恋多年即将结婚的男友，一个有前女友留下的儿子，男主角甚至还是女主男朋友的学弟…这部剧不免让我想起了直接大火的日剧《昼颜》。

他们两个之后会有怎么样的剧情呢？目前更新到第九集，强烈推荐大家去看！
