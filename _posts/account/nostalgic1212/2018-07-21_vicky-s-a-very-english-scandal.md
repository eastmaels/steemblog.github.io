前阵子Vicky曾介绍给大家日本一部由深夜SP开始爆红，继而出了日播剧的[《大叔之爱 Ossan's Love》](https://cnsteem.org/cn-reader/@nostalgic1212/vicky-s-ossan-s-love)，小伙伴们的评论基本成两个极端。男生大多直截了当说没眼看，totally的接受不到。至于女生勒，大多和我一样一路尖叫着看完⁄(⁄ ⁄ ⁄ω⁄ ⁄ ⁄)⁄ 今天，Vicky同样要介绍一部同性题材的片子：**英国式丑闻**
> Recently, I introduced a Japanese TV drama [*Ossan's Love*] (https://cnsteem.org/cn-reader/@nostalgic1212/vicky-s-ossan-s-love), and my friends' comments divided into two extremes. The male audience totally cannot accept it, while the females screaming when they watching the drama, just like me. Today, I'm also going to introduce a homosexual TV series: ***A Very English Scandal***.

#### <center>**剧情介绍&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plot Synopsis**</center>

这部英剧改编自英国近代史上**最轰动的政坛丑闻**——**杰瑞米·索普案**。杰瑞米·索普出身贵族，曾经是英国60年代最受欢迎的政客。他英国自由党的领袖，在1974年有望成为副首相的人物。而我们这位大政客，偏偏有个**“好男色”**的癖好。~~在本剧的后面，我们都可以看到索普诱拐斯科特并不是第一次出手。~~
> The British drama is based on the case of **Jeremy Thorpe**, the most sensational political scandal in modern British history. Jeremy Thorpe, a patrician, was once Britain's most popular politician in the 1960s. He is the leader of Britain's liberal party and is expected to become a deputy prime minister in 1974. And this Mr.Big, has a penchant for having sex with males.

虽说，大家现在提起英国就直接昵称其为“腐国”，但其实早在1967年之前，英国同性性行为都是违法的，将会面临严重的刑事处罚。
> Although when we mentioned the UK, we'll describe it as the "British Gaydom", homosexual sex in the UK was illegal until 1967, and any homosexual behavior will face serious criminal penalties.

索普喜新厌旧，在与斯科特分手后因为担心别人把他俩联系起来，拒绝给情人社保卡。~~科普：在当时的英国，社保卡就相当于是身份证一样的存在。如果没有社保卡就相当于没有身份，也就意味着这个人不能享受医保，不能申请工作，严格意义来说连兼职都不行。~~
> Thorpe refused to give Scott a social security card after breaking up with him for fear of being connected with him by the public. Note: in Britain, social security cards were almost like identity cards in our country. If you don't have a social security card, you don't have an identity, which means you can't get health insurance, or apply for a job. You can't even have a part-time job.

斯科特要公开其同性恋的身份，这对索普来说，等于断了他的政治前途，于是他决定派人干掉斯科特。但这位杀手实在太弱鸡了，没打中斯科特，反而打死了他的狗。盛怒之下的斯科特，在一群好心人的帮助下终于让这个斯文败类站在了审判席上。
> Scott wanted to make Thorpe's homosexuality public. For Thorpe, that was the end of his political career, so he decided to send someone to kill Scott. But the killer was so weak that he missed Scott and killed his dog instead. Scott was so angry that he determined to suit Thorpe. With the help of a group of well-wishers, he finally put the polished scoundrels on trial.

1979年，索普被指控密谋杀自己的前情人，**成为英国历史上第一个因谋杀案而受审判的英国政治家**。虽然，最终法院判定他无罪当庭释放，但失了民心的他也不得不提前结束了自己的政治生涯。
> In 1979, Thorpe was charged with the murder of his former lover, which made him as the first British politician ever to be tried for murder. Although he was eventually acquitted by the court, he had to end his political career early for losing the hearts of the public.

#### <center>**写在后面&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments**</center>

本片由休叔饰演自由党领袖索普，本喵演他的小情人。
> Hugh Grant plays Jeremy Thorpe, the leader of the liberal party, and Ben Whishaw plays his young lover.

要知道大叔都曾是一枚鲜肉，休叔年轻的时候叫美休，曾经出演过：**《理智与情感》、《莫里斯的情人》、《诺丁山》、《四个婚礼与一个葬礼》、《BJ单身日记》**等一些列经典爱情影片。而说到本喵，我想大家应该对**《香水》**这部电影并不陌生吧🎬
> Hugh Grant is incredibly handsome when he was young, and he starred in a number of classic love movies: ***Sense and Sensibility***, ***Maurice***, ***Notting Hill***, ***Four Weddings and a Funeral***, B***ridget Jones's Diary***. Speaking of Ben Whishaw, I think everyone is familiar with the film ***Perfume***.

至于二位主角是如何在片中相爱相杀的，Vicky就不再这里多做剧透啦，如果你不是特别坚定的反同主义者，这部英剧还是非常值得一看的🎉
> The amazing parts are left for you to watch by yourself, so I won't reveal more about the plot here. If you're not a particularly committed anti-gay person, this British drama is well worth watching
