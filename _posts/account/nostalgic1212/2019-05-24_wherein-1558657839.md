One of the happiest things I can imagine of the coming summer is eating the barbecue and crayfish while drinking a glass of cold beer. Last weekend, my friends and I found this restaurant on Yunnan South Road in Shanghai.

The seven of us ordered five dish of crayfish in different flavors including the spicy one. Besides, we ordered roasted potato chips, oysters, chicken wings and so on. The dip in their restaurant is quite unique. It is said that the dip is made of vinegar, soy sauce and ginger.

It costs us 200 yuan per person, and it is rather cost-effective. However, some friends said that the price is still a little expensive, and they also worried about wether it is healthy when eating crayfish outside. For that, I found an article I wrote last summer about ***How to Make the Spicy Crayfish*** and I wanna to shared it with you :D

**「Attentions」**

No.1/ Although most of the crayfish are now farmed rather than living in the ditch like they used to in the past, while in order to avoid vomiting or diarrhea,  you must make sure that you've washed them clearly;

No.2/ Be aware the amount of water, cuz too much water will reduce the flavor of the dish.

「中文部分」

一边吃烧烤和小龙虾，一边大口喝冰镇的啤酒，简直就是夏天我能想到的最幸福的事情之一。上次假期的时候，我和朋友找到了这家位于上海云南南路上的餐厅。

我们七个人一共点了五份小龙虾，分别是香辣、白灼、蛋黄、咖喱和十三香口味的。除此以外，我们还点了烤土豆片、烤生蚝、烤鸡翅等食物。他们家的蘸料非常有特色，听说是由醋、酱油和生姜熬制而成。

人均消费200元左右，性价比可以说是相当高了。不过，也有朋友说这个价格有些贵，同时也担心在外面吃小龙虾不够卫生。所以呢，我就找出了去年夏天写的一篇关于如何制作香辣小龙虾的文章分享给大家:D

**「材料」**

小龙虾、葱、蒜、香芹、香菜、花椒、干辣椒、八角、冰糖、豆瓣酱、盐、食用油、水

**「制作方法」**

1、将整个头部摘除，身子的部分用牙刷仔细刷干净；

2、葱和香芹切段，蒜一部分切片另一部分拍扁备用；

3、在锅内放入水和少许盐，等到水沸腾后倒入刚才处理好的小龙虾，等小龙虾变色后立刻捞出装盘备用；

4、锅中倒入食用油，等油温升高之后放入干辣椒、蒜片爆香，之后依次放入豆瓣酱、花椒、香芹段和冰糖进行翻炒；

5、放入小龙虾，将小龙虾炒匀后转大火并加适量水，这时候也可以撒入少许盐进行调味；

6、等到汤汁差不多收干后，撒些葱段/香菜即可出锅；

7、搞定！

**「注意事项」**

1、虽然现在小龙虾大部分是养殖的，不像过去那样生活在水沟内，但为了不拉肚子建议大家一定要将它们洗干净；

2、加水的时候要注意适量，水太多了就不好吃了。
