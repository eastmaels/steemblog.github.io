**「The Cats 猫咪」**

Most of my intimate friends know that I am a super animal lover and have many fuzzy little animals in my family. My love for cats originally came from tabby cat which kept by my grandfather.

The memory about the tabby cat is very vague. My mother once said that the cat could not be touched by others, except me. It wouldn't bite me even if I grabbed its tail and lift it up. Such an intelligent creature!

My mother and I both feed feral cats in recent years.

There are three cats living in our company's garage, and sometimes there're other cats outside the yard would come to eat. They will eat much more when they breed, especially in cold winter. Last winter, the hungry mother cat ran to my office door and called me to feed her. I was shocked but also be touched by the great maternal love.

Unlike me, my mother feeds the feral cats with fish nuggets, which means she must go to the market to buy fresh fish almost every day. A few times later, the owner of the fish stall learned about this situation. Sometimes, they will sell the fish to my mother at a relatively lower price, and sometimes they will provide some fish with no charge.

Going back home, my mother will wash and cook the fish pieces. 7 o 'clock in the morning and 3 o 'clock in the afternoon, the cats downstair will wait for my mother to feed them. If someone doesn't show up for dinner for days, we will be very worried and look for them all over the subdistrict.

Recently, two mother cats gave birth to their babies at the same time，and the baby cats are super adorable!

Feral cats' living condition doesn't optimistic. They lack of food and shelter in most times. In the meanwhile, they suffer from diseases and sometime the injuries from human beings. All we can do now is to provide them with as much food as possible and to allow them to leave relatively gracefully when they die.

My mother and I have treated a number of feral cats with eyes and skin diseases, but we are not be able to deal with more complicated symptoms. We also tried to take the cats downstairs to the hospital for sterilization, while unfortunately, we did not succeed in capturing them...

To feral cats, still there're something we can do. Please show them more kindness if it is possible. For example, please give them some food in the cold winter, or provide them with enough clean water in the hot summer. 

***To remember those feral cats which once appeared in my life. R.I.P***


「中文部分」

和我熟悉的朋友都很清楚，我是一个超级动物爱好者，家里也养了很多毛茸茸的小动物们。对毛孩子们的喜欢，最初来自爷爷养的一只狸花猫。

关于那只猫的记忆已经很模糊，听妈妈说那只猫别人都碰不得，但是被我抓住尾巴提起来都不会咬我。妈妈说，通灵性的小动物是不会欺负老人和孩子的。最后那只猫去了哪里不得而知，他的离开让幼年的我学会了「离别」两个字，也开始了我和猫的不解之缘。

我不确定是妈妈影响了我还是我影响了妈妈，我们俩都在喂养流浪猫们。

我公司车库里常住着三只大猫，两只花的和一只黑白相间的，偶尔还会来一些小客人们。在繁殖下一代的时候，他们的食量会变得非常大，尤其是在冬天。去年最冷的时候，饥饿的猫妈妈跑到我的办公室门口喊我，我在震惊之余也不经感叹母爱的伟大。

我妈妈的工作，则更为忙碌一些。不同于我使用的猫粮，妈妈主要喂他们鱼块，这就意味着她差不多每天都要去鱼摊那里买鱼。几次以后鱼摊的老板都知道了这件事，有时候会以相对低廉的价格卖给她，随机还会送上一些别的鱼。

回家以后，妈妈要把这些鱼块清洗并且煮熟。早上七点和下午三点是家里楼下的毛孩子们吃饭的时间，妈妈说他们很早就会蹲在那里等着。如果有谁连着几天没有来吃饭的话，我们会在小区里面到处找他们。

最近家里楼下的两只猫妈妈同时生了宝宝，看着那些毛茸茸的小家伙们，实在是太可爱啦！

野猫们的生存环境其实并不乐观，缺乏食物、住所、疾病、人为驱赶和伤害…我们目前能做的只是尽可能提供给他们足够的食物，以及在他们去世的时候让他们相对体面的离开。

我和妈妈曾经治疗了一些有眼疾和皮肤病的毛孩子们，但是更多复杂的病症并不是我们可以处理的。我们也曾经尝试着想带着楼下的猫咪们去医院做绝育手术，但是很无奈，我们并没有成功把他们捉起来…

对于流浪猫们，我们能做的很有限…但如果可以的话，请给他们多一点儿的善意，比如在寒冷的冬天为他们提供一些食物，或者在炎热的夏天为他们提供干净的水源 :D

***谨以此文纪念我生命中那些逝去的流浪猫们，R.I.P***
