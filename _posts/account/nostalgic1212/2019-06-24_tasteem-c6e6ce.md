After cleaning up the house last weekend, my mother and I looked for a place to have lunch near our home in Heda City. We went to the third floor of the shopping mall, and there're several restaurants seem attractive to us. Finally, we chose a Japanese restaurant named **Morita Chi**.

When we entered the restaurant, we immediately felt the strong feeling tha we're actually in Japan. There are plenty of Japanese decorations, folding fans, wines, drinks, and famous Japanese anime characters (Totoro and Lucky Cat).

There is a poster of Japanese male stars on the wall. I could hardly recognize two of them, and they are **Jun Matsumoto** and **Kazunari Ninomiya**. The other three look familiar to me while I'm not sure of their names. If you can tell who they are, please leave me a message :D

The waiter guided us to our seat beside the window. There are some delicate japanese-style tableware on the table, and I even wanna to buy some in my own house.

We ordered a bottle of white peach flavor soda which is my favorite. This bottle cost me 30rmb, which is twice as expensive as it in the supermarket!

For the main course, we ordered Rice with Fried Pork Chop in Curry Sauce. The rich flavor of curry and crispy fried pork chop inspires our appetite instantly.

-------


**Comments:** The food in this restaurant is quite delicious, especially the curry ones. Perhaps Heda City is the the only shopping mall nearby, the food price in Morita Chi is expensive and the service attitude is soso. I think I would not consider to come again in the future.
