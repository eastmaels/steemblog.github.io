**This is Steemit Monthly Author Challenge Day 17's post.**

这其实是春天时候就想写的话题。那天看到朋友发了一张樱桃的照片，心想着楼下那株有20年树龄的樱桃树应该也要结果了，说不定那些闻香而来的鸟儿们早早地就尝了鲜。但由于我上班，总也是赶不上邻居收成的时候。让我感动的是二十年来，我虽早已经从扎着麻花辫的小姑娘长大，邻居却总不会让我给我留上几根上头挂满樱桃的枝条。
> This is a topic that I wanted to write about in the spring. One day I saw my friend posted a photo of cherries, and it reminds me that the 20-year-old cherry tree downstairs would also bear fruit. Maybe the gluttonous birds might have tasted it already. I always miss my neighbors' harvest of cherries, for I have to work at the weekdays. What touched me the most is that my neighbors will me leave me branches with cherries on them, even though I've grown up.

这是来自长辈们，无言却满满的爱意吧。
> Maybe it's the love, deeply but silent, from the elders.

说起樱桃，我一直也搞不清东北大樱桃、樱桃和车厘子间的关系。只能勉强地从颜色来分辨他们：红到黑紫的是车厘子，深红色的是东北大樱桃，至于那如同女子朱唇般色泽的，就是樱桃。关于口感三者也不尽相同，其中最纯厚的自然是车厘子，最清透的就是樱桃。这其中，我独爱那最最原始的樱桃🍒
> When it comes to cherries, I've always been confused about the relationship between different kinds of them. I can distinguish them only by color: some of them are purple, some of them are deep red, and the others are vermilion which are the same as women's lips. These three kinds of cherries are also different in taste. I only love the most primitive cherry.

在我的成长中，樱桃不是一种可以大量食用的水果。在我记忆中吃的最丰盛的那次，是舅妈嫁过来的那年，带来了我这辈子见过最多的樱桃。到底是有多少呢？我想80、90后童年应该在一种塑料的大澡盆里洗过澡吧，就是用那样的大盆子满满地装了两大盆。樱桃，是我对舅妈最初的印象。
> Cherries weren't an generous edible fruit when I was growing up. I can remember the year my aunt married my uncle and she brought me the most cherries I've ever seen in my life. How much? I think the 80-90 generations should have taken a bath in a big plastic tub. The cherries she brought could fill-up two of them. Cherry was my first impression of my aunt.

物资匮乏的年代，越是吃不到的东西越是心仪。幼年时的我，对蛋糕上那红色绿色的罐头樱桃执着到了逢见必吃的地步。其实，那丝毫没有丁点儿樱桃味，充满了防腐剂味道的装饰品并不好吃，甚至可以说是很难吃。但那又如何呢？就像如今我们常常在求而不得的人与事，又有哪个人哪件事，是自己真的喜欢的。
> In the past, we're eagerly to chase whatever hard to get. When I was young, I was so attached to the red and green canned cherries on the cake that I would definitely eat them whenever I saw them. In fact, the cherries are just decorations with preservative and really taste bad. So what? Just as now we are always asking for people and things that we cannot get, but seldom of them are our truly love.

我曾经有过一段拆迁过渡住在山上的经历，那可能是我唯一的童年时光。同一个院子里的孩子，会在春花烂漫的季节上山摘果子，大多是山里的野货，放在溪水中冲洗拿衣角擦干了就直接上嘴啃。即便是现在，我都能记得那是甘甜的口感。
> I once had a period of living in the mountains, that may be my only childhood. The children in the same courtyard will go up the mountain to pick fruit in the Spring. Most of them are wild goods in the mountains. Even now, I still can remember they were sweet.

最喜欢的还是凌晨三四点的时候，小伙伴叫起来去捉萤火虫。现在的孩子，想必几乎都没有见过这些闪光的小小精灵。曾经在我家这边，弄了一个萤火虫主题公园，听说耗资巨大空运了一大批结果路上死伤无数。开园当天还引起了踩踏事件，萤火虫们也所剩无几。有时候真的很心疼现在的孩子，虽然他们有手机、电脑和iPad，可他们除了这些又还剩下些什么呢？
> When three or four o 'clock in the morning, the children in the same courtyard asked me to get up and catch fireflies. The children of today must have hardly seen these little shining elves. My hometown once set up a firefly theme park, and I heard that it cost a lot of money to transport the fireflies by air. Unfortunately, there was a stampede on the opening day, and there were few fireflies left. Nowadays, although the kids have phones, computers and iPads, they don't have the colorful and interesting childhood as I used to have.

噢，对了。即便我已经是18岁的少女了😉每年生日妈妈还是会很执着的问我，要不要吃蛋糕上的那些装饰水果。我想，无论过去多少年，在妈妈心里我都是那个追在她身后的跟屁虫，也是那个天天惦记着门口那些花儿的小屁孩吧。
> By the way, even though I'm an 18-year-old girl already, my mom would still insist on asking me whether I wanna to eat the decorative fruits on the cake on my birthday. I think, no matter how many years have pasted, I'll always be the little girl in my mother's heart.
