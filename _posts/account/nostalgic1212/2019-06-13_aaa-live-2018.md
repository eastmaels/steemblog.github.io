**Lee Kwang-soo** becomes popular through the variety show ***Running Man***, and he has always appeared as a funny entertainer. Last year, a Korean TV series starred by Lee Kwang-soo and **Jung Yu-mi** really touched the audience's deep feelings. After broadcast by tvN station, it immediately rated as the TOP 1 drama and induced a heated discussion online. It's name is ***Live***.

Unlike previous police motif dramas, *Live* shows the lives and work scenes about a group of struggling policemen. Most of them join/stay in the police force because they have no other choice.

As police, they must rush to the scene at the first time after receiving orders even on snowy days.

When they're on duty, they had to sit on the ground in the snow with their lunch boxes. It was a heavy snow, **Han Jung-O** (Jung Yu-mi) and **Yeom Sang-Soo** (Lee Kwang-soo) took a glimpse to each other. Han Jung-O's shivering feet, Yeom Sang-Soo's shaking hands, nearly everyone's noses and ears were freeze to red and the death cold food...

This series of life-based details shows us that these policemen were really cold and they are truly hungry.

Most of the career themed TV shows in China finally turn into romantic dramas, while this problem doesn't occurs in *Live*. Though it has a few romantic scenes between Han Jung-O, Yeom Sang-Soo and **Choi Myung-Ho** (Shin Dong-Wook), it's not the main part of the series.

The reason why Korean films and TV dramas with realistic themes have been popular with audiences in recent years is that their editors dare to write and are willing to write about the pain of the current society.

For example, *Live* discusses issues such as kinship, gender inequality, official power, and the current situation in grass-roots work. Audiences will have a strong emotional resonance and empathy in the process of watching the drama, which is probably one of the reasons for the high ranking score of this drama.

I remember reading an article on the Internet saying that the name of the show *Live* should be changed to ***"Survive"*** because the policemen had been nursing a grievance against the current situation for days and years. What support them to insist doing this job is the sense of righteousness to the whole society and citizens.

Most of us have never been through a rough time. After graduating from college, we tend to find a stable job, get married and then have children. When I was young, I wanted to be a big man and to do some supper awesome things. As I grow older, I don't dream about it anymore. I just want to be healthy and have a happy family.

Whereas in most of times, it's hard to be ordinary. When challenge of life comes, we can do nothing but accept it.


「中文部分」

李光洙作为《Running Man》的常驻嘉宾，一直以来都是以搞笑艺人的身份出现。去年由他和郑有美主演的韩剧《Live》赚足了观众的眼泪，在韩国tvN电视台播出之后立刻掀起了一波观看热潮。

不同于以往警察题材的电视剧，《Live》展现了一群不断挣扎的派出所民警的生活和工作场景。他们大多是因为没有别的选择才加入/留在警察这个行业中，无奈之中又带有些许卑微的感觉。

作为警察的他们即使是下雪天，接到命令后也必须第一时间冲到现场。

终于等到开饭时间，他们也只能拿着饭盒露天坐在地上在雪中吃完这一顿饭。大雪从天空飘下，**韩静吴**（郑有美 饰）和**廉尚秀**（李光洙 饰）对视了一眼。韩静吴颤抖的脚、廉尚秀握住勺子颤抖的手、几乎所有人冻的通红的耳朵和鼻子，还有几乎没有热气的晚饭…

这一系列生活化的细节都在像我们展示，这些在外执勤的警察们真的很冷，并且他们真的饿极了。

中国的许多职业剧常常会演变成爱情片，虽然《Live》中也有少许韩静吴与廉尚秀、**崔明浩**（申东旭 饰）感情戏，但那并不是整部电视剧的主要部分。韩国现实题材的影视剧之所以这几年受到观众的喜爱，主要是因为他们的编辑敢写也愿意写当下社会的痛症。

比如《Live》这部韩剧，里面就探讨了诸如亲情、男女不平等、强权、基层工作事多权小等问题。观众在观影的过程中会产生强烈的情绪共鸣和代入感，这大概也是这部剧能位居排行榜前列的原因之一吧。

我记得在网上曾经看过一篇文章，作者称《Live》这部剧的名字应该干脆改成《Survive》，因为这里面的民警们生活和工作地实在是太憋屈了。

我们之中的很多人都没有经历过什么大风大浪，大学毕业后找份相对稳定的工作然后结婚生子。年少时候曾经想要成为大人物的梦想，会随着年龄的增长变成不奢求可以有大富大贵，只希望身体健康家庭合睦。

但是很多时候，只是保持“平凡”已经很难。面对生活带给我们的考验，我们也只能全盘接下。
