In the winter of 2017, a TV show named ***This Life Is Our First Life*** soothed me as I was stuck in some chaos. There are three main lines in this drama, they are "Nam Se-Hee / Yoon Ji-Ho", "Ma Sang-Goo / Woo Soo-Ji" and "Sim Won-Seok / Yang Ho-Rang". The first couple is my favorite one, so I wanna to share more details about them.

**Yang Ho-Rang** (starred Jung So-min) determined to be a screenwriter, she worked and lived alone in Seoul. At the age of 30, she had no boyfriend or steady job. What's more, she has to give house she bought by drained all her savings to her younger brother to let him get married. Under this miserable situation, she happened to meet with Nam Se-Hee who want to find a roomer.

**Nam Se-Hee** (starred Lee Min-ki) is a programmer, who brought house property in his young age and have a detailed load return plan. He noticed that Yang Ho-Rang is able to do housework efficiently, good at sorting rubbish and takes good care of his cat. She is the best among all the roomers till now. Therefore, he proposed to Yang Ho-Rang and asked if she would like to **share a sham marriage** with him.

The whole play starts with a sham marriage between the two protagonists and ends with their true love for each other. Compared to the first 6 episodes, the rest of the scenario is a little bit cheesy. After all, it is still a romantic comedy combines warmth and reality. 

This life is our first life, but also the only life. If it is possible, I hope my life would be with ample money, not love :D

2017年的冬天，《今生是第一次》这部电视剧抚慰了陷入混乱时期的我。这部剧主要有三条人物线，分别是「尹志浩 / 南世熙」、「马相九 / 禹秀智」以及「杨浩朗 / 沈元錫」，这其中我最喜欢的是第一对。

**尹志浩**（郑素敏 饰）独自在首尔打拼，一心想要成为知名编剧。但是几年过去，已经三十岁的她没有男友、耗尽积蓄买的房子被弟弟用来结婚，甚至没有稳定的工作。没有地方去住的她，偶然间遇到男主南世熙并和他开始同居生活。

**南世熙**（李民基 饰）是一位程序员，年轻时候买下房产并有计划的还房贷。尹志浩会做家务、擅长垃圾分类并且能照顾好他养的猫咪，是所有租客中表现最优秀的，于是他提出和尹志浩假结婚。

整部剧从男女主角的契约婚姻开始，到最后真正意义上的爱上对方。相较于最初的六集，后面的剧情显得有些俗套，但仍是一部现实中透着温情的爱情喜剧片。今生是第一次，也是唯一的一次。如果是我的话，今生我希望不是爱情的部分会多一些，比如钱:D
