Many nosheries in Hangzhou are open every day. The famous chain restaurant **Zhi Weiguan** has a wide variety of snacks with relatively high prices. Meanwhile, there are some other restaurants with rather lower price and shares the most local taste of Hangzhou, just like **Xinfeng Snacks**. 

In addition to these two old-fashioned food and beverage outlets, there are great nosheries in each district, street as well as the community.

Last weekend, my friend and I went to **Pan-fried Buns with Beef in Houshi Street** to have a try.

杭州很多小吃店都是全天开放的，有品种繁多价格也相对高一些的**知味观**，也有价格亲民富有最本土杭州味道的**新丰小吃**。除去这两个老牌餐饮店以外，其实每个区、街道、社区里面都有自己特别棒的小吃店。

趁着周末有空，我就和小伙伴摸到了这家**后市街牛肉煎包(望江店)**。

Speaking of pan-fried buns with beef, the foodies in Hangzhou must familiar with noshery that near Huimin Road Primary School in Hefang Street. 

The proprietress’s voice is particularly loud with rather cold attitude. My mother and I would go there for lunch after watching the doctor in Hu Qing Yu Tang every time, for that I've been there for several times.

Most of the regular customers are the old neighbors around, but there are also some new faces who hear about the noshery and wanna to taste the legendary delicious pan-fried buns with beef. As a Internet celebrity noshery, I really have seen some foodies came here to eat by driving their Lamborghini cars. 

About a years before, due to the centralized rectification of that block, the noshery was also faced with the situation of suspending business and moving to another site.

说起牛肉煎包，老杭州的食客们一定忘不了河坊街惠民路小学附近的那一家。老板娘嗓门特别响而且态度冷淡，我和妈妈每次看完中医以后路过进去吃，总会说感觉自己就是送上去讨骂的…

回头客大多是周围的老邻居，但是也不乏一些慕名而来的食客。就像很多网红店会用“开着兰博基尼来吃”的噱头，但是负责地说我真的见过开着豪车来这家牛肉煎包店领骂的客人。

后来由于那个区块集中整治，那家店也面临停业再择店址的处境。

The reason why I provide so many background about the noshery is mainly because we guess that the pan-fried buns with beef in Houshi Street is the relocation of the one in Huimin Road.

The decoration of the noshery is relatively stark, and the sanitary conditions seems not so good. 

We ordered the pan-fried buns, the pan-fried dumplings and the beef soup. The customers will cost nearly 25-35 yuan for every person in the similar noshery in Shanghai, while we just spent 10-15 yuan per person in here. 

之所以用那么多笔墨讲这些呢，主要是因为我们猜测后市街牛肉煎包(望江店)就是惠民路那家搬迁过来的。

店面里面的布置很简单，卫生条件只是说是一般吧。我们点了煎包、锅贴和牛肉汤，两个女孩子嘛胃口比较小，不想吃不完浪费。不像上海生煎包店动则人均25-30元的价位，杭州的这些小吃店人均10-15元就可以吃的很满足啦。

I personally prefer to eat the pan-fried dumplings, and I deliberately ask the server to give me the one that pan-fired even longer than the others. The crisp pasta as well as the juicy stuffing makes me feel in the paradise. 

I ate the pan-fried dumplings before in Shanghai, and I feel the taste is a little bit strange, cuz they're half salty and half sweet. Furthermore, the vinegar there combines sour as well as sweet, and I can't get used to it. 

However, I have to say that the spicy soy sauce that Shanghainese used when they're eating fried pork chops is really special. You must try it if you have a chance to go to Shanghai.

我个人更喜欢锅贴多一些，特意让阿姨给了煎地焦一点的那种。一口咬下去酥脆的面皮和juicy的肉馅，实在是太幸福啦。

之前我在上海吃过生煎和锅贴，味道倒是不错，但是那甜不甜咸不咸的味道实在是太奇怪了…而且他们醋都是有点酸甜口的，还是觉得完全的咸味才吃起来更稳妥。不过我要说一句，上海专门拿来吃炸猪排的辣味酱油真的很特别，大家一定要试一试。

The best collocation with the pan-fried buns with beef is the beef soup. We don't wanna to be glutted with food, so we just ordered the beef soup without bean vermicelli. I heard that the noodles mixed with lard is so tasty in this noshery. 

There is also a unique soup which has sheep liver and lung in it, and my friends who have eaten it said that the taste is quite good. They prefer to pull some special pepper into the soup, which is able to reduce the feelings of greasy and made the guests have  more appetite. 

和牛肉煎包最搭配的，自然是牛肉汤啦。因为比较有饱腹感，我们没有要牛肉粉丝汤，不过还是很建议大家去尝一尝的。这家还有拌面也很值得一试，是最老底子的猪肉拌面，杭州人都很好这一口。

这里还有独有的羊肝羊肺汤，我不太敢喝所以没有点。听吃过的朋友说味道相当好，配上他们店里特调的胡椒面，既解腻又开胃。
