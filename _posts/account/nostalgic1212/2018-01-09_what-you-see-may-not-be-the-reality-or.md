<p>中国人喜欢讲，耳听为虚眼见为实。我常常会想，亲眼见到的就一定是真实吗？正好最近看到几个小故事，想拿来说一说。</p>
<p>There is an old Chinese saying: Words are wind, but seeing is believing. I often wander whether what I see is the reality or not. I wanna to share 2 stories I read recently.</p>
<p>1、或许，你欠我一句对不起 &nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you owe me a sorry</p>
<p>这是一则泰国短片。怒气冲冲的老板娘到市场收租，原本市场内欢快的气氛随着她到来一下子变的凝重起来。她和商贩说：别装可怜，该交多少交多少。她将卖肉商贩的称丢到地上，把其中一个商贩的两盘蔬菜搬走，还叫自己的两个手下把一个商贩扛了出去。有客人拍下了这些场景并传到了网上，一时间舆论哗然。网友都在声讨老板娘，并说一定不去光顾这家市场，要让市场倒闭。</p>
<p>This is a Thai video. The angry landlady went into the market to rent, and the atmosphere in the original market with her arrival suddenly became dignified. She said to the vender： Don't pretend to be poor, give me the rent. She threw the butcher's weighing on the ground and took away two of the vegetables from one of the vender. Furthermore, she asked two of her men to carry out a vendor. Some guests took these scenes and posted them on the Internet. Netizens are clamoring for the landlady, and say they must not go to this market in order to let the market shut down.</p>
<p>当手下告诉老板娘网络上发生的这些事后，她沉默了，但依然昂首挺胸一如既往的向市场走去。原来，她会把商贩多给她的钱退回去，告诉她该就多少就是多少。老板娘丢掉卖肉商贩的称，是因为他在称上面做了手脚。她不允许自己的市场里出现不诚信的买卖行为。老板娘让手下搬走单亲妈妈卖剩下的两盘蔬菜，并支付给她菜钱。至于最后两个手下架着一个商贩出去，是因为这个商贩中暑了。老板娘在一边帮他卖力的扇扇子，希望小贩能赶紧恢复。</p>
<p>She was silent when she told her about what had happened on the Internet, but she kept her head up and went back to the market. It turned out that she gave her money back to the vender and told the vendor she gave too much. The landlady threw the butcher's weighing because he had done something about it. She doesn't allow dishonest buying and selling in her market. The landlady brought the vegetables which the single mother could not sell out. As for the vendor who was taken out by two men, he was in heat stroke. The landlady was helping him with his fan, hoping the vendor would recover.</p>
<p>2、孩子，不等同于不会做坏事 &nbsp;&nbsp;Being underage is not the same as not doing bad things</p>
<p>最近在英国伦敦的西南部，三名女孩带着一名流浪汉走进餐厅。她们让流浪汉坐着，对他拍照拍视频，然后对他说她们去给他点些吃的。看起来是一起“摆拍式”的慈善行为。三个姑娘在柜台嘻嘻哈哈了一阵，然后就准备走。流浪汉叫住她们，问，你们给我点了什么吃的？几个姑娘大笑，直接推门出去，这笑声及之前她们的行为已经引起了餐馆其他客人的注意力。</p>
<p>Recently, three girls and a homeless man walked into a restaurant in southwest London. They asked the homeless man to sit down, and took a pictures as well as videos of him, and then tell him they will get him something to eat. It appears to be a "pose" charity. The three girls were at the counter laughing for a while, and then they were ready to go. The homeless stopped them and asked: "what did you give me to eat?" The girls laughed and went straight to the door. The laughter and their behavior had caused the attention of the other guests in the restaurant.</p>
<p>流浪汉等了又等，最后还是站起来去问柜台。不出所料，她们并没有下单。失望的流浪汉离开了餐厅，让潜伏在门口等待拍下流浪汉失望表情的姑娘们兴奋不已。这一幕，被Sally Cudmore放在了社交网站上。</p>
<p>The homeless guy waited for really a long time, and finally stood up and asked the counter. As expected, the girls did not did not order anything for him. The disappointed homeless left the restaurant and excited the girls waited outside bursted into heehaw. Sally Cudmore put this scene on her social networking site.</p>
<p>一时间双方各执一词。索性当时的目击者不只sally一个。多名目击者站出来以后，几个姑娘也不得不承认，自己这么做就是为了寻开心。</p>
<p>For a moment, the two sides held each other's word. Sally was not the only witness. When several witnesses stood up, these girls had to admit that they were doing it for fun.</p>
<p><strong>我们这个时代或许太过浮躁，浮躁到很多事情，我们只相信眼睛看到的，就带上自己的主观色彩。</strong></p>
<p>Our time may be too impetuous. We only believe what we see, with their own subjective color.</p>
<p>可有的时候，你看到的并不是真的。遇事不要断章取义，妄加揣测，你不是当事人，永远不知道他们经历了什么。盲目的站队并不是明智之举。</p>
<p>But sometimes, what you see is not true. Don't take things out of context. You're not a client. You never know what they've been through. It's not wise to stand in line blindly.</p>
<p>正如短片最后说的那句：As the short film concludes</p>
<p><strong>人的价值，不能仅仅以你所看到的画面作为评价，打开你的头脑，用智慧看见没有看见的事情。</strong></p>
<p>The value of a man cannot be judged only by what you see, but by opening your mind and seeing what is unseen with wisdom.</p>
