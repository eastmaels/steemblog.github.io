Hello, my dear Steemians! Here is an easy special recipe of marinated bacon provided by my younger brother @xiaoshancun for everyone to try at home. Just by looking at the photos you know it’s yummy.

In my hometown, the marinated bacon is one of the traditional foods. When we were just kids, looking forward to spending the Spring Festival, we were actually hungry for the delicious foods which made the mouth watery, especially the marinated bacon hung under the eaves. 

Every one has one’s own unique method for making marinated bacon, salty or sweet, by adding more or less salt depending one’s taste. 

The specialty dish developed by my brother has been listed in the directory of local snacks.

Streaky pork is the preferred source, and below is the making method, taking the amount of 5km as an example. 

Cut the pork into stripes, about 4cm-5cm in width, which is convenient for pickling and drying. If you like spicy food, you may add the dried pepper mince into it.

Ingredients:

Mushroom dark soy sauce, 500 grams

Salt, 50-100 grams

Add all the above ingredients into the meat which is to be pickled, and stir by hand for several times, until all kinds of spices can be evenly distributed. Afterwards stir once every other day. About ten days later, when all spices are nearly absorbed, drain the meat and hang up to dry them out in the shade for three or five days. 

Cook one or two strips in a steamer for half an hour, then you can enjoy the delicious food you’ve made by yourself. 

To enjoy the fruits of your success is a good thing!
