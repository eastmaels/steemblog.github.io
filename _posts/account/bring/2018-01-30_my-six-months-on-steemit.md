Hello, my dear friends on Steemit. I am @bring from China, and you may call me Old Wu, or 老吴 in Chinese for I am already in my fifties, which is the age of knowing the destiny according to a saying in Chinese history. But I do not believe in fate, so I keep working hard.

Time flies. It occurs to me that it is six months since I joined Steemit on July 30, 2017. I am lucky to meet with Steemit, and then we are well acquainted with each other, and become bosom friends. To her, I pour all my sorrow and feelings, hidden deep in my heart, endlessly and completely, but she is only listening quietly. To my surprise, she rewards me with dollars at last, saying I have done a good job. Since then I start to write articles on Steemit every day.

Till now I have published about 300 articles, and got my first bucket of gold on Steemit (withdrawing about $5000), with reputation scores of 62.97 and 743 followers. 

Happily, I have joined “the Global Translation Program” launched by @rivalhw and become a translator. The article “English Teahouse Series One: Words and Dictionary” written by me was published on OCD International Daily thanks to  the recommendation of @htliao and @travelgirl, two predecessors in the Chinese community.

I have also tried to write several English or bilingual articles for speakers of English. In the future I will focus on “going global” in my writing. I’m sure I will have more opportunities to participate in all kinds of activities on Steemit.

However, there are some problems that deserve attention. Others have pointed out the problems in my writing, even if I am not delighted to hear criticism, I should also be open-minded, showing tolerance. Tit for tat is undesirable. 

To err is human, to forgive is divine. I should have never been   too rigorous and dogmatic in picking faults in English translations which are fluent and authentic in general. 

For new things, what should be given is encouragement and support. Spring is coming, the Spring Festival is also drawing near, and we can also feel the breath of spring on Steemit -- all kinds of activities in full swing and the bustling crowd. This is also a festival of Steemit.

Finally, I would like to draw some words as the end of this article from a poem of Chairman Mao, the great leader and founder of the People’s Republic of China.

 “多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”

So many deeds cry out to be done,
And always urgently;
The world rolls on,
Time presses.
Ten thousand years are too long, 
Seize the day, seize the hour!
