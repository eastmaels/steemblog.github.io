If you suffered a breakup with someone you once loved deeply, how to forget her or him?

My dear friends, as a man of 50 with some experience in life, I would like to give you some suggestions, which are, I think, useful and practical.

You should bear in mind that time is a good medicine, it can cure all your injuries; time is the lethe water, it can help you to forget anything.

**Firstly, don’t stay in touch**

Continuing to “stay in touch” with her or him is dangerous, because human emotions are irrational, making us falsely believe that they’re somehow somewhere available. Love is gone, but friendship remains. That’s wrong. It is just an excuse to stay in touch. Make a lightning decision. If your love is like a lotus root, linked by fibres though divided, you will end up becoming more painful. 

Stop keeping in touch with her or him. No phone calls, no re-reading your old messages. Finally, no meeting again, and say Goodbye forever. 

**Secondly, focus on yourself**

Jump into the hobby you’ve always wanted to pursue. For instance, start reading good books. Read biographies of great personalities, and inspiring stories. Bury yourself in great books, and concentrate on them, you can find something different. Furthermore, focus onyourself–most neglected but most important, and take a fresh look at your life.

**Thirdly, forgive and forget**

Forgive her or him for whatever good, bad or evil she or he have done to you. Then forgive your own self. It’s only a good memory, the girl or guy, the lady or gentleman was gone, gone forever, and never coming back. You lose nothing, your suffering comes from the imaginary loss of someone you loved, and you do not want to accept the present or the way things are. 

**Fourthly, travel to faraway places**

Go on a trip to beautiful places to embrace the amazing nature, and you will love it. You may move to a new place, if possible. And when you return, plunge yourself into work, and try to realise your goal. 

Sometimes you have to forget what's gone, appreciate what still remains, and look forward to what's coming next.

If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things. —Albert Einstein
