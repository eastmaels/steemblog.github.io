Wherever they are, the Chinese people are always full of deep attachment and admiration to Taishan. Among the numerous worship of Taishan, three are related to Jiang Taigong.

Jiangtaigong is “Shigandang of Taishan”. There are several accounts of the origin of " Shigandang of Taishan ". One saying is that Jiang Taigong himself is Shigandang.

According to the legend Jiang Taigong was so busy creating gods that he forgot to make himself a god,so he styled himself "Shigandang of Taishan".

无论在哪里，炎黄子孙对泰山始终充满着深深的眷恋和崇拜之情。在诸多的泰山崇拜中，有三项与姜太公有关。

一、姜太公就是“泰山石敢当”。关于“泰山石敢当”究竟是怎么来的，有好几种说法。有一种说法是姜太公就是石敢当。传说姜太公封神，封来封去，到最后不知道是公而忘私，还是忙得糊涂了，竟然忘记了自己的名姓，最后只好自封为泰山石敢当。

Creating Goddess of “Granny of Taishan”. 

In Chinese folklore Bìxiá Yuánjūn (碧霞元君),also known as the Heavenly Immortal Lady, Old Mother of Taishan, is a goddess that blesses her people and eliminates the disaster, which has a great influence among the people. 

It is said that Jiang Taigong decided to make Huang Feihu God of Taishan at first, but Bìxiá Yuánjūn (碧霞元君), Huang Feihu's sister, didn't agree, who came to ask Jiang for Taishan. Brother and Sister did not make mutual concessions, so Jiang Taigong suggested to them that they should settle the matter by mountain-climbing competition, and whoever reached the top of Mount Tai first should be the God of Taishan.

Huang Feihu's sister is so clever that she came up with an idea. At the beginning of the game, she took off one of her shoes and threw it to the Jade Emperor Peak of Taishan with her divine power. 

Having good physical strength, Huang Feihu already climbed to the top of the mountain. When he saw her sister coming long, he said to her, "I came before you, and Taishan is mine.!" “I reached the peak long ago, and thought something was wrong with you. I was going to meet you on the way." Huang Feihu didn’t believe. Led by his sister, he came to the Jade Emperor peak to see the embroidered shoe which her sister had placed there before. 

Finally, Brother and Sister reached a compromise: Sister lived in Azure Cloud Temple on top of the mountain, and Brother lived in Tiankuang Palace under the mountain, who were jointly in charge of Taishan.

二、姜太公封“泰山老奶奶”。碧霞元君民间称之“泰山老奶奶”、“泰山老母”，是坐镇泰山，能为百姓赐福，消灾去难的女神。在民间极有影响，碧霞祠常年香火不断。

传说碧霞元君是黄飞虎的妹妹，姜太公封神时本来要把东岳泰山封给黄飞虎，可黄飞虎的妹妹不答应，也来找姜子牙要泰山。黄氏兄妹互不相让，争得面红耳赤。姜太公提议兄妹展开登山竞赛，谁先登上泰山，泰山就是谁的。黄飞虎的妹妹十分聪明，想出了一条妙计。比赛一开始，她先将自己的鞋子脱下一只，使了个神法，将鞋子扔到泰山玉皇顶上，然后不慌不忙地爬起山来。兄长黄飞虎体力很好，早已爬到山顶。见妹妹姗姗来迟，便对她说：“我比你先到，泰山是我的！”黄妹说：“我早就到了，以为你在路上出了什么事，前去接你来。” 黄飞虎不信，要看证据，于是黄妹领哥哥来到玉皇顶，去看自己早已放在那里的绣花鞋。尽管有证有据，黄飞虎还是不服气，认为妹妹欺骗他。最后兄妹二人达成妥协，妹妹住山上，哥哥住山下，二人共管泰山。姜子牙赶到泰山，见黄氏兄妹都协商妥了，将计就计，把黄飞虎封为泰山神，把黄妹封为碧霞元君，一个住山下天贶殿，一个在山顶碧霞祠。

King Wen of Zhou thought Jiang Taigong administered the fiefs very well with outstanding achievements, so King Wen granted him the title of Great Minister of War. 

So, people began to draw from this story a conclusion that Jiang Taigong was mighty enough to suppress ghosts and gods, and that as long as he was here ghosts and gods dared not to do evil. 

三、将刻着“姜太公在此，诸神归位”的砖砌于墙壁，用来降服鬼妖。

自唐代以来，很多地方大街小巷的要冲位置，都有刻着“姜太公在此，诸神归位”的砖砌于墙壁，用来降服鬼妖。

传说周文王曾封太公为灌坛令，管理泰山地区。结果泰山周围风调雨顺，五谷丰登，万民欢庆。忽然一天晚上，文王做了一个奇怪的梦。梦见在他出巡的路上，有一个非常漂亮的少女当道而哭。文王问其缘故，那少女答道：“我是东岳泰山神的女儿，如今到了婚嫁的年龄，父王嫁我为东海妇。可我要去东海必须兴风作雨，这样势必要毁坏百姓的庄稼和房屋，姜太公的名声威望，也会一落千丈。我左右为难，因此而哭。”文王一觉醒来，见是一梦，急召太公来问。就在太公前来面见文王的当天，泰山地区便有大风疾雨出现，泰山神之女乘太公不在，兴风作雨去了东海。

文王认为太公治理封地有方，政绩突出，于是封他为大司马。所以，民间便从这个故事得出结论，姜太公威镇诸神鬼怪，只要他在此，鬼神就不会兴妖作孽了。

因此，人们纷纷把刻着“姜太公在此，诸神归位”的砖砌在屋外、路口的墙壁上，用来降服鬼妖。
