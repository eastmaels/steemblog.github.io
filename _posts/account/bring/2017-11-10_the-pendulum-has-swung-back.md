As the saying goes, the pendulum has swung back. But now I'm afraid it will take less than ten years for the pendulum to swing back.

My colleague Ms. Guan’s husband is an associate professor at Taishan University; from her we know that her husband's university is undergoing a huge change. The system of competition for positions will be introduced, including the implementation of fixing teaching posts, defining personnel quota, fixing duty and determining remuneration, signing a contract with a term of 4 years, publishing relevant papers during the tenure, etc. in order to achieve the target.

University campuses and hospitals, taking the lead, are beginning to undergo major changes.

Government bodies and public institutions, which have always been regarded as the iron rice bowl, will also usher in earthshaking changes.

So, it is undoubtedly a head-on blow to the people who have gotten in by the back door, live comfortbly and drift along without worrying about their lives.

Nowadays, the world is changing with each passing day, and the change has become a strong color and theme.

The wave of reform has come. If you want to become a pioneer, instead of being drown in the tide, the best way is to learn the skills.

The one without real qualifications will find no place in the world. This is the progress of the society!

俗语说，三十年河东三十年河西。可是，如今恐怕用不了十年就要河东河西了。

 同事小关的老公是泰山学院的一名副教授，今天同她攀谈起来得知，她老公所在的大学正在进行改革。所有的大学老师要重新竞争上岗，实行定岗、定职、定责、定酬，签订聘用合同，任期4年，并要求在任期内要发表相关论文，达到制定的目标等。

大学校园、医院，首当其冲，正开始发生重大的变化。

历来被认为是铁饭碗的机关事业单位，也即将迎来翻天覆地的变革。

所以，那种凭着关系、后门，认为就可以抱着铁饭碗混日子，衣食无忧，可以混到退休的人，无疑是当头一棒。

当今世界日新月异，瞬息万变，变革成为强烈的色彩和主题。

改革的浪潮已来，要想成为弄潮儿，不致使自己淹没于潮水中，唯有学好本领才是上策。

滥竽充数者，最终会没了市场。这就是社会的进步！
