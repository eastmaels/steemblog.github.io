Preface: it is lucky to grow up at the foot of Taishan, and having the advantage of being in a favored position, I would introduce local Taishan food to my friends on the Steemit from this issue. Borrowing the title from the phrase of “A Bite of China”, I also name it “A Bite of Taishan”. In this issue Taishan baked wheaten cake with donkey oil is introduced. 

Fan Town is located in the east part of Taishan (Mount Tai), about 20km away from Taian City, and under the jurisdiction of Daiyue District, Taian City, Shandong Province. Fan Town was first built in Ming Dynasty, named Fanjiazhuang village after the surname of Fan, and then gradually expanded into a market town, thus the name of Fan Town.

There are many cultural sites, places of interest and historic sites in Fan Town. Sun Chuanfang, the biggest warlord in the late period of the Republic of China, was a native of Fan Town.

According the records, when Martial Emperor in Han Dynasty offered sacrifices to Taishan, he stayed in the City of Fenggao (within Fan Town now), and was served by Fan Town Baked Wheaten Cake with donkey oil. The cake turned out to be delicious and gained highest praise from the emperor. Since then Taishan Baked Wheaten Cake has been famous all over the world.

It was selected into Shandong intangible cultural heritage list in 2011. 

A piece of Taishan Baked Wheaten Cake with donkey oil sells at 5 yuan (about one dollar), five times the ordinary one. You know, only 10 kilograms of donkey oil can be made from a donkey, so the cost of the cake is high.

If you have the chance to visit Taishan, you must not forget to go to Fan Town to taste the authentic Taishan Baked Wheaten Cake with donkey oil. It will definitely make your visit worthwhile.

前言：有幸生长在泰山脚下，也是近水楼台先得月，从本期起我将陆续向Steemit上的各位朋友们介绍一下泰山地方名吃。借鉴“舌尖上的中国”一说，我也把自己文章的题目取名为“舌尖上的泰山”，希望对您有所裨益。本期介绍的是泰山驴油火烧。

范镇，山东省泰安市岱岳区辖镇，位于泰山东麓，距市区20公里。范镇始建于明，以范氏得名范家庄，后逐渐形成集镇，遂改名为范镇。

范镇历史上文化遗址、名胜、古迹较多，著名的有奉高城遗址，沟头村落遗址，洪福寺、增福寺、四槐庵、付家庄观音阁等古建筑遗址。民国直系后期最大军阀孙传芳就是范镇岔河村人。

范镇火烧又称泰山火烧，是一道色香味俱全的汉族传统小吃。因产于山东省泰安市岱岳区范镇而得名，是范镇第一名吃，在全国各地享有盛名，销量海内外八十多个国家和地区。其制作历史悠久，至今已有400多年的历史。几经工艺改造，如今已是驰名中外，家喻户晓，深受世界各国消费者的喜爱。

正宗的范镇火烧是用精制面粉，盐，驴油，花椒，芝麻等材料混合而成。其实正宗的范镇火烧做法比较复杂，要有18道工序才能走上人们的餐桌。捞麦，选面，发引面，熟面，发酵面，拌面，混面团，揉面，化碱，面碱混合，接面，制酥油，试面，擀面团，上顶炉，烤制，两头装箱。这18道工序完全手工制作。

和面，熬油酥(用驴油熬），芝麻盐，案板，擀面杖，火烧专用炉等。把发好的面弄成纪子，用擀面杖擀成条，一次在面饼上抹上酥油、芝麻或者芝麻盐。然后卷起，擀成饼状。贴在炉上。在炉面上熥一遍，记得两面都要熥，然后放在抽子里烤，大约2分钟后可以看到一个正宗的范镇火烧了。

据记载，汉武帝封泰山时，住在奉高城（位于范镇境内），有食宫在蒸制随军主食“馍”时，依照当地民众只有在庆祝丰收时，才特意制作的贡品——“驴油火烧”之做法，也在其面团中加用当地的驴油等调料。成熟的“馍饼”奉于武帝品尝，膳毕，汉武帝龙颜大悦，拍案叫绝。一时间，“泰山驴油火烧”名扬天下。

泰山驴油火烧制作技艺，在2011年入选山东省非物质文化遗产保护名录。泰山驴油火烧好吃得益于驴油酥，驴油酥由驴油、面粉和调味料熬制，冷却后凝固而成。这其中关键的调味料是祖传秘方，有去除驴油腥味的作用。

一个泰山驴油火烧要5元,是普通火烧的五倍,一头驴只能出10公斤的驴油，所以驴油火烧的成本高。

泰山驴油火烧具有层次分明，外酥内软，满口香酥，回味悠长等独特之处，营养丰富，老少皆宜，便于携带储存，宜为馈赠佳品。

如果您有机会来泰山游览，一定不要忘了到范镇去尝一尝那正宗的泰山驴油火烧，定会让你不虚此行。
