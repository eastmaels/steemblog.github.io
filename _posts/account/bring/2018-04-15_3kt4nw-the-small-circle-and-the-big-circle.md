The only way for a boy coming from a rural family to go out of the countryside is to rely on reading, or knowledge, and I have come in this way. Knowledge can change the destiny,and I hold this belief, never changing my mind. 

But how hard and rough the road is, only one’s personal  experience can tell.

In a materialistic and money-mad times, reading was destined to be a different kind of scenery. 

Because there was no immediate and material change, I was once blamed or even reprimanded by my wife, which I could endure and understand her intentions and her own difficulties. To a destitute couple nothing goes well. After all, poverty is our tangible pain. The ideal future, perhaps beautiful, cannot bring anything tangible in the present.

Ideal and future are the big circle, and the reality is the small one. People staying in the small cirlce cannot see, or realise the broad and profound world outside, indulging in self-delusion and, like the frog at the bottom of a well, failing to know how big the world above is. 

My opinion about the Small Circle and the Big Circle has been ridiculed and dismissed by my wife. Although staying in the small circl, I always think of the big thing, that’s to improve themselves,  rise to a higher level, and enter the big circle.

Self satisfaction, indulging in the joy over one’s success, drifting along and following the prescribed order, all these can be referred to as “the comfort zone”.

Stability and security won’t develop your character. In order to grow and get out of your comfort zone, you have to explore the unknown things.

By trying new things and things you’re afraid of, your self-esteem will grow. When you open your wings to fly, you allow other cultures and ideas to enter your life, and you will have a lot to learn.

The world is an open book and your only task is to read it, to learn new lessons every day.
