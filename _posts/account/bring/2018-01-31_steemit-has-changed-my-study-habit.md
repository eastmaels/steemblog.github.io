Unconsciously, one person or one thing is walking into your heart, and I have scarcely remembered when I began my writing. All I can remember is that I started to keep a diary in a notebook with a plastic cover which I felt as if I had found a priceless treasure.  

When I had an English class in junior high school, I had a strong interest in English. Although Chinese and English are different languages, I remain enthusiastic and interested in Chinese writing and English learning until today. 

I spent more time in learning English than in writing article before I joined Steemit. After all, it's almost unrealistic to earn a living by writing on Steemit. However, if you learn English well, you would have a chance to show your talents and realize your ambition. 

Steemit is such a good platform where you can not only develop your writing skills but also earn more money. Why not go ahead with it?

With the popularization and application of computer, I rarely write with a pen, but when I start with a first draft some characters escape me for the moment which I have always talked about. There are even some wrongly written characters in my writings. Out of practice for a long time, everything will become unfamiliar.

But all of this has been completely changed by Steemit.

Full of talented men and overwhelming posts with beautiful pictures, Steemit is an arena where only the strong stand out from the competition. If you want to get the upvotes from the big fish or whales, you should produce high - quality articles.

English learning is set in a secondary place. I begin to search for knowledge that I could need but know only a bit, and hunt up my daughter's textbooks and reading materials to read it carefully. I also take time to read Readers, Youth Digest, etc carefully.

Even in the course of English learning, I also pay attention to some of the knowledge points in case of need.

From a self-learner of English major, I begin to become that of Chinese language major, all of which benefits from Steemit.

Although the road is endless and faraway, I still want to pursue the truth in the world.

**Brief Biography of Old Wu, or 老吴 in Chinese:

Old Wu, male, born on Dec. 12, 1968, Chinese nationality, is a good man and has been studying English for over 30 years. He teaches himself English, and he does not believe in fate, so he keeps working hard. Humorous and optimistic, he will become your good friend. **
