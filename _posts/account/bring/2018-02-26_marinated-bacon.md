This is my entry for this week’s Food Photography Contest organised by @juliank.

Just by looking at the photos you know it’s yummy.

In my hometown, the marinated bacon is one of the traditional foods. The specialty dish developed by my younger brother @xiaoshancun has been listed in the directory of local snacks.

Streaky pork is the preferred source, and below is the making method, taking the amount of 5km as an example. 

Cut the pork into stripes, about 4cm-5cm in width, which is convenient for pickling and drying. If you like spicy food, you may add the dried pepper mince into it.

Ingredients:
Soybean sauce, 1000 grams
Mushroom dark soy sauce, 500 grams
Sugar, 100 grams
Monosodium glutamate, 20 grams
Wine, 250 grams
Salt, 50-100 grams

Add all the above ingredients into the meat which is to be pickled, and stir by hand for several times, until all kinds of spices can be evenly distributed. Afterwards stir once every other day. About ten days later, when all spices are nearly absorbed, drain the meat and hang up to dry them out in the shade for three or five days. 

Cook one or two strips in a steamer for half an hour, then you can enjoy the delicious food you’ve made by yourself.
