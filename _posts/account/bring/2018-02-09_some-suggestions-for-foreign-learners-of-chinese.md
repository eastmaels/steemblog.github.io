If you are a foreigner who are especially interested in Chinese, and determined to learn Chinese well, here is my advice for you to learn Chinese.

First of all, I suggest that you first learn Chinese in your country, going to a university or a training institution. If it is more suitable for you to learn via network, online learning is a good choice.

Of course, you have to study hard, including Chinese grammar, sentence structure, new words, etc. You must learn them by heart, and try to communicate with your Chinese friends, though in simple Chinese, it is also a kind of exercise. In order to write wonderful emails, you have to look up the dictionary for more words regularly.

For a period of time, half a year or a year later, when conditions permit, you may come to China to continue your learning of Chinese. Generally, you have better go to a Chinese training school. Of course, your classmates are probably foreign learners of Chinese from all parts of the world. Chinese classes usually make you feel boring and irritable, because your classmates may not be serious enough to learn Chinese. Even if they get together after class, they are used to communicating in English. It's very bad for you to be eager to learn Chinese well. 

So, I would advise you to go to a place where you can find Chinese people to practice Chinese after class every day, such as parks, university campuses, cafes, etc. Finding a place to sit in the park or campus and taking out your homework to do carefully, you can ask the Chinese people around you for help when you have problems in learning the Chinese characters. Chinese people will be ready to help those foreigners who are learning Chinese. So you can know a lot of Chinese friends through language learnign.

You have to create an environment and get involved in Chinese culture for yourself to learn Chinese, instead staying in your own English environment.

It is recommended that the local dialects of the place you want to go in China should be close to standard Chinese, not like Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong dialects, which are quite different from standard Chinese, commonly called Mandarin.

Your friends in China should be almost Chinese who can't speak English, so your Chinese will be improved very quickly. 

You can teach English in your spare time in China, so you can also earn the money for learning Chinese. In your learning Chinese, whenever you meet unknown words, you should write them down in  the notebook, then look up the dictionary, and sort out systematically, for example, according to verbs, nouns, adjectives, place names, food, animals and so on. 

In this way, you will be able to speak Chinese fluently for a few years in China, and the Chinese will not think you a foreigner. 

如果你是一名老外，而且对汉语特别感兴趣，并立志要学好汉语，那么这是我这位中国人对你学习汉语的几点建议。

首先，我建议你先在你的国家学上一段时间的汉语，去大学或者培训机构里学习。如果对你来说，更为合适的还是网络的话，通过网络学习也是一个不错的选择。

当然，你要认真地学习，语法、句子结构、生词等，要会背会写汉字，要和认识的中国朋友用邮件交流，尽管简单，也是一种锻炼。为了写出精彩的邮件，你得经常查字典找更多的词汇。

这样学习上一段时间，半年或者一年后，条件允许的话，就来中国继续学习汉语。一般是进入汉语培训学校，当然你的同学很可能是来自世界各地的汉语学习者。汉语课通常会让你感觉很枯燥，也会让你烦躁，因为你的同学可能都不怎么认真学，即使下课后聚在一起，他们还会用英语交流。对急于学好汉语的你来说，这很不爽。

所以，我会建议你每天下课后，到一个可以找中国人练习中文的地方，比如：公园、大学校园、咖啡馆等。到了那个公园或者校园就找个地方坐下，拿出作业认真做，碰到不认识的字就请教周边的中国人。碰到学习汉语的老外，中国人会热情帮助的。这样你就通过语言结识了很多中国朋友。

你要给自己创造学习汉语的环境，不能呆在自己英语环境中，要主动融入到中国的文化中。

建议你去的中国的地方，其地方方言要接近标准普通话，不要像上海，浙江，福建，广东那一带方言，他们与普通话完全不同。

你在中国的朋友圈要几乎都是中国人，而且是不会说英语的中国人，这样你的汉语水平就提高的很快。

你可以在中国兼职教英语，这样也能赚取学习汉语的费用。学习汉语时，每当看到不认识的字，你要记在本子上，然后查字典，系统性地整理出来，比如，按照动词、名词、形容词、地名、食物、动物等来分类。

这样，在中国待上几年，你就能够说一口流利的汉语，而中国人也就不会觉得你是一名老外了。
