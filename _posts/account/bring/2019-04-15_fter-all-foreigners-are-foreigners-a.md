Every day I spend much time on Steemit, browsing and upvoting My Feed’s postings, and sometimes I take a look at the postings under the “New”. However I scarcely browse the postings under the “Fashion”, the pending payout of which, I find, is very schocking. Morever, technical articles there are Greek to me. 

Several days ago., I ran into two postings under the “New”, which are interesting and of high quality written in English. One is “Haven't wrote a shitpost in a while” by @roundbeargames. I left a message below his posting-- If the title should be "Haven't written a shitpost in a while"?, which had a mistake in grammar. And “lol i have no idea” was his reply. 

From his homepage, I get to know he is from Seoul, Korea. He made a reply to me with “i have no idea” instead of “I don’t know”. Judged by this point, he is truly a foreigner.

Another is @ogoowinner from Nigeria, and most of her  postings, including “Virtues of Humility”, are made with positive attitude. I made some comments about her postings, for instance, “You are a prolific writer with positive attitude towards life and people.” She replied with “I appreciate this kind words.”instead of “Thank you”. She also made a reply with “Feel free to do so.” to my message—“Nice post. Plan to translate some of your articles into Chinese.”

From these words, I understand that her English is very authentic and should be the official language in her country.

From the two foreigners, I see that one should use English authentically and naturally, giving people a comfortable feeling, rather than rigid, difficult, and making them feel uncomfortable.

Steemit is a very good platform, I am proud of you! My Steemit! Really, it's a pleasure to have friends coming from afar!

我每天呆在Steemit的时间并不算少，除了浏览My Feed 的动态、点赞外，我有时还要去“最新”帖子看一看。我几乎从不去“流行”一栏看看，那里每篇帖子的收益让我吃惊，再者，好多技术专业类的文章，如同天书一般。

前几天，就在“最新”那里，我看到了两篇很是有趣、高质量的帖子，那是两名老外的大作。一篇是@roundbeargames 的“Haven't wrote a shitpost in a while”，我感到题目有点语法上的小错误，便给他留言：If the title should be "Haven't written a shitpost in a while"? 人家回复：lol i have no idea. 

我去了他的主页，才发现是一名来自首尔的韩国人。尽管英语不是其本族语，但他的答复没有用I don't know，这口气就是一名老外了。

另一篇是@ogoowinner的“Virtues of Humility”，她写的帖子质量很高，也充满正能量。我也去了他的主页，但不知她来自哪里。经过交流，才知她来自尼日利亚。我在她的帖子下面留言：You are a prolific writer with positive attitude towards life and people. 人家回复： I appreciate this kind words. 用的是appreciate而没有用Thank you. 我觉得他的文章很好，准备翻译成汉语：Nice post. Plan to translate some of your articles into Chinese. 她的回复是：Feel free to do so. 从这些用词上可知，她的英语很地道，在她的国家里应该是官方语言了。

从两位老外身上，使我懂得了运用英语要地道、自然，给人一种舒适的感觉，而不是生硬、艰涩，让人心情不爽。

Steemit就是一个很好的平台，我为你自豪！我的Steemit！真的，有朋自远方来，不亦乐乎！
