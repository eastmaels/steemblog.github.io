Respected Professors,

I am xx, a student from Taian No. 1 Middle School of Shandong Province. Taian is a beautiful city where Mountain Taishan is located. 

As an optimistic, cheerful and kind boy, I have been studying hard since primary school, and my academic achievements have always been among the best. Meanwhile I am also committed to all-round development. From primary school to high school, I have served as a monitor to the class and a leader of the Student Council. I have won the title of Outstanding Student Leader in Taian City.

 First, please allow me to introduce my personal interests and hobbies, for I always like to be an interesting person. I like playing basketball. With a height of 1.86 meters and a healthy body, I can play center on the basketball team with great facility. I like to travel, and I have once been to Changbaishan Mountain to see the beautiful Tianchi, to Inner Mongolia to enjoy the unique prairie and sunrise, to France and Italy to experience different customs. All these footprints have broadened my vision and enriched my life. 

I am also skilled in preparing baking, nougat, black tea cake, chocolate cookies and so on. After all, this is also a way for me to relax!

My interests and hobbies have not affected my study, but promoted my study instead. I like mathematics and physics most, and I have got the first prize in High School Mathematics Competition in Shandong Province, the third prize in Chinese Physics Olympiad and the second prize in National English Competition for Primary School Students. I like to make small experiments in physics, for example, making flashlights by use of waste products, assemblying small solar-powered fan, and so on. Unfortunately, I have not applied for a patent on these small inventions.

It is my dream to have my own patent one day, so today, I am here, standing in the classroom of Central South University, to report my past nineteen years to my dear professors.

The material discipline of Central South University has a long history. At present, the material college has 1 national key primary discipline --"Material Science and Engineering", 3 national key secondary disciplines—“Material Science, Material Physics and Material Processing Engineering”, one of the few colleges of the national "211 Project" and "985 Project" universities which own 3 national key secondary disciplines.

Profound cultural background, excellent faculty and advanced teaching ideas of Central South University—all these have attracted me deeply, happening to coincide with my hobbies and specialty.

I hope that in the next few years, I can sit in the classrooms of Central South University, listening to the teachers' guidance. Surely, I will grow up with my dream here!

Thank you！

尊敬的各位老师：

大家好。

我叫xx，来自美丽的泰山脚下，就读于山东省泰安市第一中学。

我是一个乐观开朗善良的男孩，学习认真刻苦，从小学至今，成绩一直名列前茅，同时也致力于全面发展，从小学到高中一直担任班长，也担任校学生会干部等职务，曾获得泰安市级优秀学生干部等荣誉。

一直喜欢做个有趣的人，先不谈学习，先说说我的小兴趣。我喜欢打篮球，这一八六的小身板打中锋得心应手；我喜欢旅游，去长白山看过美丽的天池，去内蒙古看过别样的草原日出，去法国、意大利体验过不同的风土人情，这些足迹开阔了我的视野，丰富了我的人生；我还有一门拿得出手艺——奇奇烘焙，牛轧糖、伯爵红茶蛋糕、巧克力曲奇饼干等，不在话下。这也是我休闲放松心情的一种方式！

 再来谈谈学习，我的兴趣并没有影响我的学习，反而更加促进了学习。我最喜欢数学和物理，曾获得山东省高中数学竞赛一等奖、全国中学生物理竞赛三等奖及全国中学生英语能力竞赛二等奖。我喜欢做物理小实验，废品利用做手电筒，组装太阳能板小风扇等，遗憾的是没有自己的小专利。我的理想就是有朝一日可以有自己的专利，所以，今天我才站在这里，站在中南大学的教室里，向各位老师汇报我的前十九年。通过了解，我知道咱们中南大学材料学科有着悠久的历史，目前, 学院拥有“材料科学与工程”一级国家重点学科及材料学、材料物理学、材料加工工程3个二级国家重点学科,是国家“211工程”、“985工程”高校中少数几所拥有3个二级国家重点学科的材料学院之一。重点是中南大学有着厚重的文化底蕴和雄厚的师资力量，还有先进的教学理念，这些都深深吸引了我，与我的爱好与特长不谋而合，这里正是我梦想开始的地方，希望未来的几年里，我可以坐在中南大的教室里，聆听老师的指导，在这里让我与梦想一起成长！

谢谢老师！
