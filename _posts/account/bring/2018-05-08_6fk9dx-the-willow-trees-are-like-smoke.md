The willow branches don’t speak
But can ward off the evil spirits
The willow trees don’t talk
But can communicate with each other

The willow trees become shady
Sway like smoke 
Asking the willow trees
Why do we call you weeping willows?

Friends appear, friends disappear
The past is like smoke
Do what you must do 
Miss whom you should miss

In China, some people carry willow branches with them on the day of their Tomb Sweeping or Qingming Festival. Willow branches are also put up on gates and/or front doors, which they believe help ward off the evil spirits that wander on Qingming. Legend states that on Qingming Festival, the ruler of the underworld allows the spirits of the dead to return to earth. Since their presence may not always be welcome, willow branches keep them away.

When insects begin nibbling a willow tree, the tree sends out a special smell at once. This smell tells the other willows that harmful insects are coming near. All of them quickly make a chemical in their leaves, which is bad to the insects. The insects do not like it and they fly away soon. In this way, the willow trees protect themselves from the insects.
