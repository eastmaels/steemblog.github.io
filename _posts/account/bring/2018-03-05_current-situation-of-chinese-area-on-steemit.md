For more than one month, I have found a phenomenon, that is, the pending payment of articles is obviously reduced, and sometimes the payment of $1-2 even becomes unachievable. Morever, I have also observed the situation concerning my brother @xiaoshancun as well as other several friends, and found the same results. Are the articles of poor quality? If the pending payment of one or a few posts is very low, it is still acceptable. If all the posts have been affected, despite our efforts in writing articles assiduously, there must be external factors in it.

As a tributary in the long river of Steemit, the Chinese Area is just a small one. During the normal period, there are about 500-600 people, and about 300 people during the depression, and now the number is close to 1000 people. For recent months, the up breakout of Steem and SBD has attracted a large number of newcomers into the river. With a common purpose, they have got together, which is to be able to get gold in the Steemit river. Speaking the same language, they come to the Chinese Area. Of course, there are many people who are fluent in foreign languages, and often visit the foreign language areas, but there are fewer people like this.

Crowds of minnows poured into the narrow river. They did not follow the routine, or even cheated, not only muddying the water, but also spoiling the atmosphere. Plagiarism, rough work, repeated post, even attacking each other, all kinds of chaos, dazzling the eyes.

The purpose of muddying the water is nothing more than to fish in troubled waters. It is difficult to distinguish the good from the bad in the muddy water. Having no energy to identify, big fishes and whales had to stop upvoting, or rarely upvoted. Some big fishes did not want to wade the muddy water, so they just left Chinese Area and went to the foreign language area. 

Although there are many warm and enthusiastic minnows who upvote generously, their voting powers are too small, which is of no avail. I have noticed the pending payments of a lot of articles written by my brother @xiaoshancun are less than $1.00 though there are about 80-90 people giving their upvoting. 

This is the feeling I have had for a month. What are we going to do as minnows that have been working hard on Steemt?

In the face of a system or status, there are only three ways: to change it, to adapt to it, and to escape it. Unable to change or not wanting to leave, we have to adapt to it passively at present. I believe that this phenomenon will not last long.

Heroes emerge in troubled times, and the times call for heroes, because the chaos of the world provide a stage for the emergence of heroes.

Even the posts carefully made have less pending payment, how much will it be for those meaningless and rubbish posts? In the long run, when their enthusiasm falls down, many minnows will naturally retreat, after all, they can not afford to consume the energy.

Maybe to keep watching for the big fishes and whales is right. In order to prevent the mistake, it is better not to upvote, for there is no time to discover the quality posts in the vast sea of posts.

We might as well take the "time for space" strategy, take a little rest, save energy, and wait for the water of the river of Steemit to become clear.

Whoever sticks to the end and laughs at the end, is the ultimate winner.
