Hello Steemians!

This is our entry to @juliank's Smartphone Photography Contest.


Once I visited the marvelous primitive tribes—Two-storied Stone Buliding（二起楼村）, a small village not far away from Mountain Tai, in Taian City, Shandong Province, China. 

The sky is clear and clean, the sun is shining brightly, and almond trees are blossoming. Spring is coming.

The photo is taken by me.
