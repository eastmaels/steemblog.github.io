My dear friends, if you read my posts on Steemit, you would expect to meet a young man. After all, an elderly person is not expected to be active on Steemit. However I am already in my fifties, and here I would like to introduce myself to you.

@bring— you may call me Old Wu, or 老吴 in Chinese: Old Wu, male, born on Dec. 12, 1968, Chinese nationality, is a good man and has been studying English for over 30 years. He teaches himself English, and he does not believe in fate, so he keeps working hard. Humorous and optimistic, he will become your good friend.

As a traditional and conservative person, I am not willing to accept new things. My elder brother, @wnh518518, joined the Steemit in May 2017, which was the period of prosperity for the Chinese Domain. One day, my brother, pointing to a post on Steemit, said to me, you can find that writing an article can earn hundreds of dollars. Isn't it good for you to write articles on it? I only laughed away, declining to give any comment. Is there such a good thing in the world? That's how I brushed past Steemit.

Later my elder brother made a personal example as an effective means of convincing me. It is not an invisible or visionary thing for me to write articles and get paid on Steemit. Since I love writing and English translation, if there is a platform for you to show, why not go ahead with it?

After my elder brother failed in helping me registering account on Steemit for several times, he turned to @myfirst for help. I would have never thought that @myfirst was so generous that he gave me the account @bring which he had registered in October 2016. Now the actual registration date of July 30, 2017 has escaped your attention. I am grateful to my predecessor @myfirst, who has made my dream come true.

Up till now I have posted about 400 articles on Steemit, among them some are well received, and three articles are published on OCD International Daily. 

It is my dream that some day I would have 2000 followers and my reputation scores reach 65, which I know I still have a long way to go. 

Having 1000 followers is a good thing to celebrate. But to realise my another dream needs painstaking efforts. One is never too old to learn. Seize the day, seize the hour. Only in this way can  the dream come true.
