Today I came across an article, from which I knew that Steemit is two years old. I am so happy that I want to write something to celebrate her birthday, and I am so busy in racking my brains. 

I searched the Internet for relevant information: the Steemit white paper was first released in March 2016, and on July 4, 2016, Steemit was officially released. From this point of view, it is the right time to write this article.

The support and encouragement given by the predecessors and my friends on Steemit are hidden in the bottom of my heart, which I will remember forever. Here I would just show what I have seen and heard on Steemit in the last 8 months, which I would like to share with you.

**First, My Harvest**

It has been 8 months since I joined Steemit on July 30, 2017, which is a great success to me. 

1.Having exercised my ability of writing

I often feel sentimental, but sometimes I don't bother to write. Since I joined Steemit, I have been serious—a post a day, even two posts a day, totalling more than 400 posts so far. At the same time I also publish my posts in "Baidu library". Till now there are 450 articles on the Open Document, and the Value of Wealth has increased to more than 10000. My writing capability is also advanced, and even sometimes I finish writing one post immediately. 

I also have the desire to read, because I worry that the brain will be stretched, and I would like to continue to prepare spiritual food for my brain. 

2.Having improved my English translation ability

I become crazy for the original English articles, and I have realized that it is not a small challenge for me to translate these Chinese articles with strong cultural background into anthentic English though I have joined the Monthly Review Translation Program sponsored by @rivalhw. I searched out The English World magazines which I bought twenty to thirty years ago, ready to re- read, and seriously began to read Zhang Peiji's Selected Modern Chinese Essays (1-4 volume). From the Amazon I bought tow books on poetry translation, including "An Exploration into Poetry Translation", and started to study the translation of poetry.

In a word, thanks to Steemit, I have been in the ocean of English knowledge.

3.A good harvest

Before I joined Steemit, I had not met such a good thing. I could also have a good income for writing, and can be recognized by others. I am lucky to sell some SBD and steem in the martket upswing. But I know it's just a motive, not a purpose. The gains and losses, honour and disgrace are only floating smoke and passing clouds. Only continuous improvement is the long-term policy. 

4.Having broadened the field of vision

If you lie on the bottom of the well, you will never see the world above. With the accumulation of knowledge, when you rise to the ground, you will know that the world is so large that a person is so small. At the same time, I have also found that Steemit is a place where people of unusual ability are to be found, and that there are many big fishes or whales that have never shown their truth, which makes me feel the vastness and depth of the world, and encourages me to continue to learn and explore the mysteries of the world.

Choosing Steemit is a good thing. You may write wherever you have time, and you may have a good income. What a good thing! In spite of the recent decline in bitcoin, we firmly believe that this splendour we’ve had will come back.

Steemit is still young, and there is a long way for her to go. What we could do is offer our support and love.

**Second, My suggestion**

1. The first tag can not be modified. For two times I have accidentally typed the wrong word, but failing to correct. Why can't the first tag be modified?

2. Once the resteemed article is forwarded, it can not be revoked. It's easy to forward the article, but it can't cancel the forwarding. Why?

3. After 7 days, the vote could not be made, which may be a professional and technical problem, to which I do not know whether there is a solution.

4. The system mechanism should be improved so that relation tickets and canvassing may be eliminated and the quality posts will get the due benefit.

It is suggested that the system should be improved in order to attract more people to join Steemit.

Steemit is only two years old. Like a lovely child, she is joyfully running to you and me, and what we can do is to greet her, hug her, and then take her hand to walk towards the future.
