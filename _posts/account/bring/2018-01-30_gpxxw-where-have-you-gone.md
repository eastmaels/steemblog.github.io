For so a long time 
I haven’t seen you 
Big fish and whales
Where have you gone
Perhaps 
Running away into the distance
But for what reason 
I don’t know

Giving guidance and help
You lead me into the sea
I’m only a minnow
Swimming in the sea 
Trembling with fear
To you 
I owe it all 
For what I am today

I miss you 
My dear friends
Come back home 
Come back home
But nothing changed 
Nothing to say
Nothing to see
