One day in July 2017 my elder brother showed me a website, saying that someone on it could make several hundred dollars by publishing postings on it. I made no reply, only giving him a faint smile, which meant I didn’t believe that. Just pie in the sky! 

Several days later,he drew about 200 dollars, and the 500 dollars from the bank gained by publishing articles on this website. How surprising it is! Really writing could make money. That’s true!

And then I began my journey on Steem. As a social media platform, Steem is drawing thousands of thousands of visitors, where everyone can write, publish, upvote and get pending payout depending on others’ upvote. 

Steem is like a river or the sea, full of fishes , big or small. Each can swim in it, communicating with others, showing their talents and getting others’ applause. However there are few big fishes or whales than tens of hundreds of minnows on Steem. We, beginnners on Steem, are only small fishes, and our pending payout and reputation mostly rely on the upvotes from big fishes. But how to achieve it? You may say that buying upvote is not a bad way. You may also find that a good article get few upvotes and little pending payout, but a posting with few words or even with only some beautiful scenic pictures could make a fortune.

Yes, there is no such thing as a free lunch. You must pay for it. And you will find it’s a balance, what you’ve get meets what you’ve paid. Morever, it’s only temporary, not lasting longer. Only high-quality postings could obtain upvotes from big fishes and attract their attention. 

 So try to write good articles and move on with perseverance and endurance. 

Steem is a platform where everyone can play games. How to guarantee a fair play system, I think, is the most important problem facing Steemians. The road ahead is long, Steem is young. We should look after it with care, tolerance and hope, hoping that Steem can have a bright future.
