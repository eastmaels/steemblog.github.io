Since ancient times, people have regarded Taishan as a sacred mountain, a holy mountain, and a soul mountain, making Taishan become so widely admired. 

Chinese people tend to describe a situation as being as stable as Taishan Mountain or a matter as being as weighty as Taishan Mountain, giving clear evidence of such an impression. 

It is true that overlooking the surrounding mountains on top of Taishan is just like in the blue sky--the rolling clouds below, looking like the sea or reefs, giving people a kind of feeling that they are walking on air. No wonder that the emperors of all dynasties come to perform grand ceremony of worship of heaven on Taishan Mountain to pray and say thanks for peace and prosperity travelling a long way and going through rivers and mountains. They regard Taishan as a ladder to Heaven, so climbing Taishan is like going up to the sky.

自古人们把泰山视作神山、圣山、灵山，对泰山石推崇至甚。

事实上也是如此，登上山顶如同置身青天，鸟瞰山下云雾翻滚，如大海似海礁，给人一种飘飘欲仙的感觉。难怪历朝历代政绩卓越的皇帝，历尽千山万水前来封禅，他们把泰山视作天梯，登泰山如同登天。人们向往的天堂是虚无飘渺的，而玉皇顶的楼台琼阁与山水构成的美景却是实实在在的。

Taishan comprises the three worlds: the Heaven, man’s world and the Hell. Climbing over the South Gate to Heaven, you enter into the world of Heaven. From South Gate to Heaven down to Haoli Mountain is the man’s world, and from Haoli Mountain to Naihe Rive, the Hell. The paradise that people long for is in the clouds, but ancient buildings on the Jade Emperor Peak constitute the landscape with mountains and rivers, which is real.

The masterpiece of Creation of the Gods starts with an introduction of Coiled Dragon Mountain ( Wuyan Mountain within the territory of Culai Mountain). At that time the king Zhou of Shang came to burn joss sticks, after seeing that the Goddess was very beautiful, he wanted to tease her by writing freely a poem on the wall. When she returned to the palace and saw the writing, the Goddess was so  angry that she sent a fox in the mountain to become Daji, who later brought calamity to the country and destroyed the king of Zhou. 

Later, Jiang Ziya rewarded the meritorious ministers in Taishan, so Taishan became the divine land. The book Journey to the West was also a myth and legend modeled on Taishan, which had clothed it in strong superstition colors. 

Why did the Goddess use the colored stones of Taishan to patch the sky, instead of stones from other places? Didn’t it further confirm that Taishan stones worked? 

泰山囊裹了三界，从南天门往上为天堂，至山下蒿里为人间，蒿里山到渿河为地狱。《封神演义》这部巨作，就是以盘龙山{徂徕境内无盐山}做引子开始写成的。当时纣王来此降香，见女娲娘娘长得很美，信笔题壁一诗来戏弄之。女娲回宫后睹此大怒，遂派山中一狐变作妲己，以色祸国，灭了纣王。后来，姜子牙把有功大臣封神于泰山，泰安于是成了神州。西游记也是以泰山为模特编写的神话传说。这更给泰山披上了浓厚的迷信色彩。女娲补天为什么偏偏用泰山的五色石，不用其他地方的石块？不更加证实了泰山石的灵验吗？泰山稳则国家安，天地间的灵气几乎都凝聚在泰山石中。作为镇宅之宝，只有泰山石才敢当此任。

The three great buildings in China—Tiankuang Palace, Hall of Great Achievement, and Emperor's Audience Hall all used Taishan stones as the foundation. After the founding of the people's Republic of China, the Great Hall of the People and the Monument to the People's Heroes were all based on the Taishan stones. Mao Zedong Memorial Hall was made of Taishan (Culai Mountain )granite. 

It is thus clear that what a position the Taishan stone is occupying in the minds of the people. 

以前中国的三大建筑：宋天贶殿、大成殿、金銮殿，都是用泰山石来铺垫的。就是一般的寺庙也用泰山石镶镇四角。中华人民共和国建国后，人民大会堂和人民英雄纪念碑的建筑，都以泰山石作为奠基，毛泽东纪念堂也全是用的泰山（徂徕山）花岗岩。可见，泰山石在人们心目中占据了何等位置！
