Rising and falling along lofty ridges and towering ranges, twisting and turning across deserts and plateaus for thousands of kilometers, the Great Wall of China is a fantastic sight. It is a great military defensive system of the world built in ancient times.

The construction of the Great Wall went on for over two thousand years through various historical periods and particularly during the Ming Dynasty. It was then over 6300 kilometers from Yalu River in the east to Jiayuguan in the west and became known as the Great Wall of ten thousand Li (one li equals to 0.5 kiometer). 

Most parts of the Great Wall we see today were constructed in this period. 

The Great Wall today may have lost its former functions; it has nevertheless become a monument of the ancient civilization of the Chinese nation. It is one of the wonders of the world, symbolizing the wit and spirit of the Chinese nation.

The Great Wall ranks the first in the program of “Chinese Attactions Most Favored by Foreigners”, followed by Mt.Tai.

It is about in March of 2015 that I visited the Great Wall at Badaling. Bustling people and steep road, it is just like climbing Mt. Tai, and from time to time you may run into foreigners from different countries. 

Walking along the Great Wall, I met with a foreign visitor from Germany with a clown riding on his neck, who spoke good English. Many visitors vied each other to have a picture with him and, of course, with the clown. Waiting for quite a while, I had a picture taken with the foreign friend and his clown on the Great Wall, showing I have visited here. 

We had a good laugh, and I know, that was our happy smiles. Wish the foreign friend a pleasant journey. 

Chairman Mao, the great leader and founder of China, once said, "不到长城非好汉”(One who fails to reach the Great Wall is not a hero.) —these seven Chinese characters are still engraved near the Great Wall at Badaling. 

That’s a pleasant trip to the Great Wall. 

Brief Biography of Old Wu, or 老吴 in Chinese:
Old Wu, male, born on Dec. 12, 1968, Chinese nationality, is a good man and has been studying English for over 30 years. He teaches himself English, and he does not believe in fate, so he keeps working hard. Humorous and optimistic, he will become your good friend.
