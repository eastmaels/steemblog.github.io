Although it is already the Spring Equinox, it is still cold these  days, and people have put on the thick clothes that were removed. 

After suddenly getting warmer, the weather has turned cold again. The spring in the north is like this. Though it is spring, people always feel that the winter has not gone far, and suddenly they would prepare for the summer. Actually, there is no shadow of spring at all. This is what the saying goes, "the spring neck is short."

On my way home from work, I will pass a stone bridge as usual where people around will sell their vegetables, fruits and so on, serving as a small market. You may find fresh vegetables, good price, and honest people, which naturally is a lively scene.

Today the temperature dropped to zero, especially in the evening and there was a stinging wind. On the bridge, there was only an old man selling vegetables—two bunches of spinach and one bunch of scallion, who, because of the cold wind, was crouching behind the stone edge. Looking at the fresh vegetables, and the shivering old man, I bought all the vegetables: 1 yuan for one bunch of spinach, and 3 yuan for 0.5 kg of scallion, totalling 6.8 yuan. I gave the old man 7 yuan. I just thought that the old man would be able to go home earlier, instead of waiting for the next buyer in the cold wind.

The old man is not rich, and maybe selling these vegetables can bring some income to him and his family. We all have our aged parents, and we will grow old some day. Feeling for others will build a society filled with love.

卖菜的老人

虽说已是春分了，可这几天还是挺冷的，人们又穿上了脱掉的厚衣服。乍暖还寒，北方的春天就是这样，虽是春天了，可总觉得冬天还未走远，可走着走着夏天就来了，根本就没有春天的影子，这就是俗话说的“春脖子短”。

下班回家快到家的路上，照例要经过一座石桥，平日里这就是一个小市场，周围的老百姓会把自己地里种的蔬菜、瓜果等拿到这里来卖。蔬菜新鲜，价格实惠，人也实诚，自然是一派热闹景象。

可今日温度降到了零下，尤其是到了黄昏，又刮起了刺人的寒风，桥头上只有一位老人在卖菜，摆着两捆菠菜和一捆葱，因为风大、寒冷，老人蜷缩在了后面的石柱边。看着新鲜的蔬菜，再看看寒颤颤的老人，我便把这菜全部买了下来：菠菜1元一捆，葱3元1斤，合计了一下共计6.8元，我给了老人7元钱。我只是想，这样老人就可以早早回家了，而不用再在寒风中等下去。

老人并不富裕，也许那点蔬菜能给他和家人带来点收入。我们都有老人，我们也都会有老的那一天，将心比心，才是一个充满爱的社会。
