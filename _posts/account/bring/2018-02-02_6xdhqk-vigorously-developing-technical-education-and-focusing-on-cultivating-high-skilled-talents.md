In recent years, taking Scientific Outlook on Development as a guide and accelerating the transformation of economic development mode as the main line, Daiyue District has vigorously implemented the strategy of opening up and innovation, and accelerated the construction of industrial characteristics and structural advantages in order to seize the commanding point for the future development. 

All industrial enterprises within the district give full play to the role of the main body, adhere to independent innovation, and focus on the transformation and upgrading. Therefore, with the transformation and upgrading of economic development mode, demand quantity and demand quality for high quality workers have increased by leaps and bounds.

But the development situation of skilled talents, especially high skilled talents cannot meet the economic and social development in the district. Looking from total amount, senior workers, technicians (including senior technicians) and other high skilled talents account for a low proportion of employees. From the perspective of industrial structure, there are serious structural contradictions in the distribution of skilled talents, especially high skilled talents. They are mainly concentrated in traditional machinery, chemical industry, electronics and other industries, with shortage of high skilled talents in the new energy, industrial 4.0, cultural tourism and creative industries and other new industries. The serious shortage of high skilled talents has become the bottleneck of the social and economic development in the district.

We think that only by vigorously developing the technical education to develop more high skilled talents with a combination of both skills and theories for the society can this problem be fundamentally solved mainly from the following aspects:

ⅠAdhering to Educational Innovation and Developing Consensus on Serving the Local Economic and Social Development

In recent years, technical education has shown a good momentum of development. With the rapid development of social economy, enterprises' demand for highly skilled talents is increasing, and the shortage of skilled workers is serious. In the past two years, the state and the provinces and cities have introduced a series of documents on accelerating the development of technical education, and formulated a series of policies and measures to encourage the growth of skilled talents. At the same time, the social propaganda has been intensified. Through various forms of publicity, traditional concepts have been changed and a good image of the technical education has been established, initially forming a public opinion atmosphere which is conducive to the development. But generally speaking, real innovation factors are  meager. How to speed up the technical education innovation?

1.Innovate the Notion of Running a School and Fully Expand the Social Training Function of Technical Colleges

Based on requirements of transformation and upgrading, we should serve enterprises' development to build the cultivation base for high skilled talents. Facing the employment work, we should provide services for the unemployed and laid-off workers to build employment training base. Geared to the needs of urbanization, we should also provide services for the transfer of rural labor force to build the training base for the rural labor force, so that the technical education and the current economic development are more closely combined.

2.Innovate School-running System and Strengthen Deep Combination with Enterprises

Firstly, this can obtain financial support, attract business capital, and improve conditions of running a school. Secondly, we can learn to understand the advanced technology and information about enterprises’ development in time, and apply them to the teaching practice. Thirdly, in this way we can introduce enterprises’ management to establish the campus culture fitting in with the corporate culture. Fourthly, it can make the enterprises more concerned about the development of the school to form a stable employment channel.

3.Innovate Cultivation System and Open up a Broad Source of Students

We should gradually transfer from enrolling junior middle school students as the main, to enrolling senior high school students and college graduates, and to the training of employees, making it become a normal social phenomenon for college graduates to receive training in technical schools.
