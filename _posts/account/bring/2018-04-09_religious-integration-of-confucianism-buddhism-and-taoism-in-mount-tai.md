The earliest religion that took root in Mount Tai was Taoism, and Taoism regarded Mount Tai as an ideal place for the dwelling of the immortals and wonderful place of practice for Taoists, and the famous Taoists that had practiced in Mount Tai were Cui Wenzi, Qiu Chuji and Zhang Sanfeng. From the foot to the top of the mountain, the scenic spots along the axis of south of Mount Tai have become strongholds of Taoism. Most of the buildings on Mount Tai were built by Taoists, including Heavenly Queen Pool, Azure Cloud Temple, Memorial Temple of Lord Guan, Doumu Palace, etc.

最早在泰山扎根的宗教派别是道教，道教视泰山为神仙居住的洞府和道士理想的修行地，在泰山修炼过的著名道士有崔文子、丘处机、张三丰等。从山脚到山顶，泰山南面向阳的中轴线上的险胜之地基本上都成了道教的据点。泰山上的大多建筑。都是由道教人士建造的，如：碧霞祠、王母池、关帝庙、斗母宫等。

The origin of Buddhism and Taishan should be traced back to the Eastern Han Dynasty. Subsequently, Divine Rock Temple, Guang Hua Temple, Monastery of Omnipresent Light, Bamboo Forest Temple and Yu Quan Temple.were built. In Sutra Rock Valley of Mount Tai and Culai Mountain there are stone inscriptions of "Diamond Sutra" in Sanskrit. Taoism occupied a positive position in Mount Tai, so Buddhism could only open up territory in other parts of Mount Tai. Divine Rock Temple is in the northwest of Mount Tai, in the territory of Ji'nan City, and all other temples are not along the central axis. Besides, Culai Mountain is in the southeast of Mount Tai, with a straight distance of about 20 kilometers.

佛教与泰山的渊源要追溯到东汉时期，随后修建了灵岩寺、光华寺、普照寺、竹林寺、玉泉寺等，泰山经石峪和徂徕山上刻有《金刚经》等梵文。道教先入为主，占据了泰山正面的主要位置，所以佛教只能在泰山的其他地方开辟领地。灵岩寺在泰山西北方向，在济南市境内；普照寺、竹林寺、玉泉寺、经石峪等均不在中轴线上；况且徂徕山在泰山东南方，直线距离约20公里。

The development of Confucianism in Mount Tai began with Confucius' many visits. So far, there are many scenic spots related to Confucius' activities in Mount Tai: Confucius' Boarding Place, Confucius Temple, and the Tiger Gully. When Confucius passed over Mount Tai, there was a woman crying at the grave. It is in this place that Confucius sighed sadly, "Tyranny is fiercer than tigers!"

Through constant struggling, merging, and expanding, the religious integration of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism is finally achieved in Mount Tai.

儒教在泰山的发展始于孔子的多次登临，泰山上至今还留有许多与孔子活动有关的景点：孔子登临处坊、孔子庙、瞻鲁台、猛虎沟等。孔子过泰山侧，有妇人哭于墓者而哀……孔子就是在猛虎沟，发出了“苛政猛于虎”的感叹！

道教、佛教、儒教三家不断斗争、融合、壮大，最终在泰山形成了三教合一的宗教文化。
