View the Rain of Taipei in Winter is a song by Meng Tingwei, from which you can imagine how tempting the rain there is. During the Qingming Festival, the weather was cold, constantly changing, and even Beijing had a light snow. There is also a saying "View the snow of Beijing on Qingming Festival" on the Internet. Unfortunately, it is just a saying, not a song.

Based on @chinadaily's posts of the last few days— "Active Users Information in the Chinese Area of the Last Seven Days", we have found that the number of active users has dropped to the normal level, about 500-600 people, and the number of active users exceeds 1000 at the time of surging. In the past 2 months, Steemit has become calm again. This shows that only 500-600 Steemians are real viewers of the Steemit Sea.

The raging sea and monstrous waves are attracting many people to the Steemit Sea. When the waves are rising, we will be surprised and when the waves fall, we feel frightened. The sea is quiet; therefore we can feel her quietness, depth, broadness and strong heartbeat.

The breeze, the taste of the sea, and the impact of the waves will quietly come into your hearts, who are viewing the sea...

Whether it is summer and winter, please come to see the Steemit Sea! If you are a real sea viewer, appreciating slowly and tasting carefully, you can feel her boundless charm.

**静静的Steemit大海**

孟庭苇有首歌叫《冬季到台北来看雨》，想必那里的雨景煞是诱人。清明时节，乍暖还寒，天气变化无常，北京竟下起了雪。网上也就有了“清明到北京来看雪”的说法，可惜只是一种说法，并不是一首歌。

查看前辈@chinadaily近几日的贴子《近七日中文区活跃用户信息速览》，发现活跃用户数量已降至了正常时的水平，大约500-600人，而在币值高涨之时，活跃用户人数超过了1000人。近2个月的跌落，使得Steemit大海又恢复了往日的宁静。这说明，到最后来Steemit观海的还是那500-600人。

汹涌的海水，滔天的巨浪，吸引了一拨又一拨来观海的人们。海浪高涨时的惊喜，波浪回落时的惶恐，大浪淘沙，待到风平浪静，剩下的才是真正来观海的人们。

静静的海，反倒更能感受到她的静谧、深沉、博大和强烈的心跳。

海风的轻拂，大海的味道，冲击的海浪声，才会静静走进观海人的心里……

无问寒暑，请到Steemit来看海！只要你是个真正的观海人，慢慢欣赏，细细品尝，你就能感受到她无穷的魅力。
