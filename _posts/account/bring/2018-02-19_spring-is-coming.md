The sun is shining brightly
The sky is clear
The willow trees have begun to bud
Flowers are blooming
A beautiful spring is coming quietly

The east wind brings warmth
Spring thunder rises suddenly
All things wake up
The ice is beginning to break up 
A scene of prosperity

A year's plan starts with spring
Spring is the beginning of a bright future
Also the beginning of the new year
If you don’t plow in spring, nothing is expected in autumn
A young idler, an old beggar
Seize the spring, seize the day
To create a better tomorrow

春天来了

阳光明媚
晴空万里
柳树抽芽
花儿绽放
美好春天悄悄来临

东风送暖
春雷乍起
万物苏醒
冰河融化
一片欣欣向荣之景

一年之计在于春
春天是美好前景的开始
也是新一年的开局之时
春若不耕，秋无所望
少若不勤，老无所归
抓住春天，抓住今日
才能创造美好的明天
