前不久，淘宝发布了一则 40 万年薪招 60 岁以上老人的招聘，工作内容是体验“亲情版”手淘产品引发了众多网友的关注。招聘发布后，阿里方面很快的收到了大量的简历。近日，有媒体采访了部分应聘者，而他们的来历也不简单，很可能分分钟“碾压”年轻人。

淘宝产品经理表示，这次招募的老年用户不仅仅是为了倾听他们的建议，同时还想了解老年用户对淘宝的看法，以及老年人的生活圈子，从而更好的切入老年市场。

对此，网友表示，去应聘的老年“大神”啊，看来在职场上你大爷大妈永远都是你大爷大妈。

66岁的曾大伯退休前在浙江杭州余杭区径山镇工作，已退休了5年。当日他手里拎着一只重重的袋子，拿出来是一叠厚厚的奖状，有“2016年余杭区最美离退休干部党支部书记”“优秀共产党员”等荣誉，数了数有14本。
