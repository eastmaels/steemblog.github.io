像一幅古朴的风景画

漫步古镇，那些美丽生动如昔

细细品味六千年历史文明

你又能否想起古镇旧日的模样？



石板路，石头墙，青瓦房

沧桑古树，老街老巷

访古的游人啊

你又是否听得见乡音、记得住乡愁？



Impression of the Ancient Town


Like a simple landscape

Walking through the town, those beautiful sights as vivid as before

Savoring the historical civilization of six thousand years 

Can you imagine what the ancient town had been?


Stone road, stone wall, green tile-roofed houses

Ancient trees, old streets 

Ancient sites visitors

Do you hear the local accent and remember your homesickness?
