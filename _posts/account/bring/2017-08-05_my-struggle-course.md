每一部奋斗史都是一部苦难史，但随着时间的推移，那些曾让你刻骨铭心的故事都将会成为促你奋进的一笔财富。

Every struggle course is a history of suffering, but with the passage of time, those stories that have been engraved on your mind will become a treasure that pushes you forward.

一、在山师大校园石凳上过夜

1. Staying the Night on the Stone Bench in Shandong Normal University

1999年，我取得了高教自学考试英语专业的本科毕业证书，达到了申请学士学位的资格，但需到济南参加学位外语的考试。

In 1999, I got a university diploma in higher education self-study examination, and got the qualification to apply for a bachelor's degree. But it required to take an examination of a foreign language for obtaining such degree.

2000年8月底的一天，我提前去了山东师范大学考点。那时的交通不像现在发达，现在从泰安乘高铁到济南才17分钟。第一次来到大学校园，一切都那么新鲜，学习的氛围那样浓厚，我在校园里转了又转，着实让人流连忘返。

One day at the end of August 2000, I went to the examination center of Shandong Normal University ahead of time. The traffic wasn't as developed as it is now. It's only 17 minutes from Tai'an to Ji'nan by high-speed rail. It was the first time I came to the university campus, everything was so fresh and the atmosphere of learning was so strong. I turned around in the campus. It was really fascinating.

天黑了，要寻找晚上住宿的地方。校园外的小旅馆安全上又不放心，所以还是决定住在学校里面。只是可惜学校里的公寓住满了，连15元/每人的大房间也没有了。我在校园里的石凳上坐着，想着明天的考试，总想早早休息，便脱下穿的那件短袖（那是女儿的大姨送我的杉杉牌短袖，平日里舍不得穿）盖在身上躺下睡着了。等我醒来，已是早上三、四点钟，毕竟是八月底的天了，半夜里有些寒意。

It was getting dark. I had to look for somewhere to stay in the evening. The little hotels outside the campus were unsafe, so I decided to stay inside the school. It was a pity that the apartment in the school was full, and even the shared house was full (15 yuan / person). I was sitting on the stone bench in the campus, thinking of the test tomorrow, and wanting to rest early. Taking off the short-sleeved shirt and covering myself up, I lay down and fell asleep—the Shanshan brand shirt was given to me by the elder aunt of my daughter, and I was too fond to wear it on weekdays. When I woke up, it was already three or four in the morning, after all, it was at the end of August, I felt a bit cold in the middle of the night.

我便起来，在矗立着毛主席他老人家塑像的广场那里踱来踱去。一直到六、七点钟，路上总算有了行人，校门口的小吃摊也开张了。我便吃了早饭，准备考试去了。

I got up and walked up and down the square where stood a statue of Chairman Mao. Up until six or seven there were pedestrians on the road at last, and the snack stand at the school gate opened. I had breakfast and prepared for the examination.

2001年，我获得了文学士学位。

In 2001, I received the Bachelor of Arts degree.

二、在山大校园门口附近坐了一夜

2. Sitting Overnight Near the Campus Entrance of Shandong Unive!rsity

2001年10月，我被减员下岗，离开原来常白班的科室工作，去干四班倒的另一项工作。正好我要去山大参加研究生考前辅导，没有办法，我只好答应待我参加辅导回来后就去倒班了。

In October 2001, laid off by downsizing, I had to leave the original department work to do another work in four shifts. Because I was going to take the postgraduate pre-exam tutorial class, I had no choice but agreed to go to work shifts after I attended the tutorial class.

第一天的辅导原定在下午6点至晚上8点，可那位辅导的老师要从郑州赶过来，火车晚点，等到辅导结束后已是晚上9点了。

The first day of the tutorial was scheduled for 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., but the tutor was coming from Zhengzhou, the train was delayed and it was already 9 p.m. after the tutorial ended.

外语院校在山东大学的老校区，古色古香，建筑风格与外语院校似乎很相称。看着偌大的自习室里静静看书的学子，我又是多么羡慕啊！

The foreign language school was at the old campus of Shandong University, having an antique flavour and the architectural style which seemed to fit the foreign language school. Looking at the students quietly reading in such big study room, how envious I was!

校门口附近有几个石凳子，我坐在那里忧心忡忡。回去上四班，孩子那么小，谁来照看呢？如果考不上就真的没有退路了…… 想着想着，竟有些困意打了个盹，忽听女儿喊爸爸的声音，一下子惊醒来，原来是旁边玩耍的小女孩在喊她的爸爸。

There were several stone benches near the school gate. I sat there worrying. Going back to work in four shifts, my daughter was so young, who would take care of her? If I failed the graduate test, there really was no route of retreat…I found myself falling asleep, suddenly hearing my daughter shouting Daddy. I woke up with a start, finding that it was the little girl playing nearby shouting her father. 

我在校门口附近的路上漫无目的地走着，为了安全起见，又不敢走的太远。坐在路边，困了就趴在膝盖上，有巡逻的警察走过，看了身份证，问了几句话后就走开了。不只是为了省那几十元钱住宿费，只是我真的连找住宿的心情都没有了。

I walked aimlessly along the road near the school gate. I was afraid to go too far for safety reasons. Sitting on the side of the road, I spent the night with my head on the knees when feeling sleepy.  There were patrolling police walking past, and after they read my ID card, and asked a few words, they walked away. Not just to save the dozens of dollars of accommodation fee, but I really didn’t  even bother to find a place to pass the night.

回来后得知，女儿晚上找不到我，抱着我的那本英语书哭了大半天，说爸爸在家时经常看那本书，那哭声似乎爸爸永远走了……

When I came back, I learned that when my daughter couldn't find me at night, she cried for a long time, holding the English book. She said her father often read the book when he was at home. It seemed that her father was gone forever...

2001年10月30日，我开始上四班。等到成绩下来，我已上了半年的班了。政治65分，日语80分，可专业课还是差几分。毕竟全是自学的英语，再有大的提高短时间内是很难了。

On October 30, 2001, I began to work in four shifts. By the time I got my grades, I had been in this work for half a year. Politics 65 points, Japanese 80 points, but my major courses were not good. After all, it was all by my self-study, and it was hard to make a big improvement in a short time.

整整一年后，2002年10月30日，我辞职应聘去了一家国际贸易公司。这时，女儿开始上小学了。

Exactly a year later, on October 30, 2002, I resigned and was employed by an international trading company. At this time, my daughter attended primary school.

2003年，我又通过考试进入了政府机关。

In 2003, I passed the examination and got into the government office. 

时至今日，我也没有放弃过学习。我觉得，奋斗是一件终身的事情。

To this day, I have not given up learning. I think, struggle is a lifelong thing. 

附：我当年研究生准考证以及从报纸上裁下来的山大外语系的介绍，我把它们粘贴在了我那本翻得烂烂的词典上。

Attached: Admission Card for Postgraduate Entrance Examination, and Introductioon of Department of Foreign Languages of Shandong University from a newspaper---I stuck them on my dictionary which was completely dog-eared.
