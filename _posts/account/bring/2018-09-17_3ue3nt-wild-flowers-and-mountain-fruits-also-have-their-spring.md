A seed, despite wind blow and rain wash, has no idea where it should go. Even if falling on the barren hills or under roadside stones, or being blown to the cracks in the wall, as long as there is earth and sunshine, it will sprout and grow up, swaying in the wind.

There is no watering, no pruning, or no more care. Without complaints, lament, or abandonment, it only takes roots deeply to bear more fruits, giving fruits and flowers back to the world. People recall their pleasant flavor and enjoy their good-looking.

Only these wild flowers and mountain fruits will laugh at the flowers in the greenhouse...

一粒种子，任凭狂风吹打、雨水冲刷，却不知最终何处是归宿。纵是落到荒山野岭、路边石下，还是被吹落到墙缝里，只要给点泥土、给点阳光，它就发芽、长大，摇曳在风中。

无人浇灌，无人修剪，更无人呵护，没有怨言，没有哀叹，更没有自弃。它只把根扎深，把果结实，把果实、鲜花回报给这个世界。让人品尝，回味；让人观赏，悦目。

也唯有野花、山果才会对着温室里的花草，大笑......
