享受孤独。适度脱离群体，学会和自己相处。孤独是可贵的，在这样没有被打扰的时间和空间里，完全依照自己的意愿来安排这段时光怎样度过，是一种莫大的“自由”。在每天非常有限的自由的时空中，如果可以做到“自律”，有计划、有节制、自我激励，也就可以带来“效率”，成就那些别人做不到的事情，也就成就了你自己。

Enjoy loneliness. You should get out of the crowd moderately and learn to get along with yourself. Loneliness is precious. It is a great “freedom” to arrange such a period of time according to your own wishes in undisturbed time and space. In very limited free time and space every day, if you can be self-disciplined, ambitious, temperate and self-motivated, "efficiency" can be brought. Therefore you can accomplish what others cannot do, and realise yourself.

正是孤独让你变得出众，而不是合群。但凡那些才华横溢、有所作为的人，都是会享受和利用孤独的人，他们在孤独的时候积蓄能量，才能在不孤独的时候爆发和绽放；但凡那些害怕孤独，成天在饭桌、酒桌、歌厅里寻找存在感的人，一定都会淹没于芸芸众生。

It is loneliness that makes you different, not gregariousness. But those brilliant and accomplished people will enjoy and make use of loneliness. Only they save energy when they're lonely can they release energy and become successful when they are not lonely. Those people, who are afraid of loneliness, and all day finding the sense of presence at the dining table and in singing hall, will eventually be lost in the crowd.
