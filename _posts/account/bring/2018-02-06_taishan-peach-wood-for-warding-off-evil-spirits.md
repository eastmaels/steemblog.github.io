Having a very important position in China's folk culture and religion, peach wood, also called wood for beating the dragon and frightening the evil spirits, is widely used material for avoiding evil spirits. In "Kua Fu's Race with the Sun" mythology, Kua Fu threw the peach and it turned into a forest of peach before his death. 

The earliest Spring Festival couplets are made of peach wood, also known as peach wood charms against evil hung on the gate on the Lunar New Year's Eve in ancient times. For thousands of years, peach wood has the magic power of warding off evil spirits, hence the name of “divine tree”.

Located in the west of Taishan, Feicheng City has the largest peach orchard in the world, which has been cultivated for thousands of years. Sweet and beautiful, the large peaches, also called Buddha peaches, have been royal tributes for ages and become widely known at home and abroad. 

Feicheng peach wood, dense and delicate with fragrance, is a sacred wood for avoiding evil spirits, deeply favored by Taoists.

Many kinds of wood crafts have been developed including Stereo carving, engraving, carving, flat line carving, wood sword, Maitreya Buddha, God of Longevity, etc. 

For peach wood sword there are more than 3000 varieties of product.

The legend varies that the peach wood can ward off evil spirits, but after all it is a symbol of happiness and safety. 

泰山驱鬼辟邪之桃木

桃木在我国民间文化和信仰上有极其重要的位置。桃木亦名“降龙木”、“鬼怖木”，是用途最为广泛的伐邪制鬼材料。传说夸父追日，临死前将神木抛出化成了一片桃林。我国最早的春联都是用桃木板做的，又称桃符，几千年来，桃木就有镇灾避邪之说，被称为神木。

位于泰山西麓的肥城具有世上最大的桃园，已有千年的栽培历史。桃个大而优，味甘而形美，冠以肥桃之称，亦称佛桃，为历代皇室贡品，声名远播于海内外。

肥城桃木，质密细腻，木体清香，为辟邪镇灾之神物，而深得道家方士之宠爱青睐。

桃木工艺品种类繁多，现已发展桃木立体雕刻、平面雕刻、镂空雕刻、线雕、桃木剑、桃木如意、桃木关、弥勒佛、寿星等多种桃木产品，仅桃木剑就3000多个品种。

关于桃木能避邪的传说不一，但桃木毕竟是吉祥平安的象征。
