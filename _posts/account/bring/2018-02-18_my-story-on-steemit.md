My dear friends on Steemit, 

First, I would like to extend my best wishes to all of you on this occasion of the Spring Festival (the Lunar New Year), and then I would like to introduce myself to you.

@bring— you may call me Old Wu, or 老吴 in Chinese: Old Wu, male, born on Dec. 12, 1968, Chinese nationality, is a good man and has been studying English for over 30 years. He teaches himself English, and he does not believe in fate, so he keeps working hard. Humorous and optimistic, he will become your good friend.

As a traditional and conservative person, I am not willing to accept new things. My elder brother, @wnh518518, joined the Steemit in May 2017, which was the period of prosperity for the Chinese Domain. One day, my brother, pointing to a post on Steemit, said to me, "you can find that writing an article can earn hundreds of dollars. Isn't it good for you to write articles on it?" I only laughed away, declining to give any comment. Is there such a good thing in the world? That's how I brushed past Steemit.

Later my elder brother made a personal example as an effective means of convincing me. It is not an invisible or visionary thing for me to write articles and get paid on Steemit. Since I love writing and English translation, if there is a platform for you to show, why not go ahead with it?

After my elder brother failed in helping me registering account on Steemit for several times, he turned to @myfirst for help. I would have never thought that @myfirst was so generous that he gave me the account @bring which he had registered in October 2016. Now the actual registration date of July 30, 2017 has escaped your attention. I am grateful to my predecessor @myfirst, who has made my dream come true.

When I first met you, the feeling was like an old friend. Meeting with Steemit and getting well acquainted with each other, I finally have a confidant that I can talk to, and a platform to show myself, at the same time, from which I also find my own shortcomings. High quality articles and authentic English posts are worth my envying, so I can't stop or get slack.

@sweetsssj's articles have surprised me, not only the benefit of her articles, but also her authentic English.

However, there is a bit of regret in it. Steemit is a platform and a stage, and everyone on it is both a player and a judge. Whenever celebrities come out, cheers are deafening, with thousands of followers. Even they only strike a pose, they would receive many many upvotes. But sometimes no one would show any interest in the minnow’s result of painstaking efforts.

Think it over, that’s a problem of capability. The master will not worry that he will be neglected, only a glimmer will be easily extinguished. The gold will always shine.

There is no perfect thing in the world, just as there is no meaning in life, you have to make it meaningful.

You and I, I and you, will create beautiful stories one after another on Steemit, which are worth remembering.
