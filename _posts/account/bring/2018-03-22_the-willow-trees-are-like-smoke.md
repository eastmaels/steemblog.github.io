The willow branches don’t speak
But can ward off the evil spirits
The willow trees don’t talk
But can communicate with each other

The willow trees become shady
Sway like smoke 
Asking the willow trees
Why do we call you weeping willows?

Friends appear, friends disappear
The past is like smoke
Do what you must do 
Miss whom you should miss

In China, some people carry willow branches with them on the day of their Tomb Sweeping or Qingming Festival. Willow branches are also put up on gates and/or front doors, which they believe help ward off the evil spirits that wander on Qingming. Legend states that on Qingming Festival, the ruler of the underworld allows the spirits of the dead to return to earth. Since their presence may not always be welcome, willow branches keep them away.

When insects begin nibbling a willow tree, the tree sends out a special smell at once. This smell tells the other willows that harmful insects are coming near. All of them quickly make a chemical in their leaves. This chemical is bad to the insects. The insects do not like it and they fly away soon. In this way, the willow trees protect themselves from the insects.

柳如烟

柳枝不语
却能驱逐鬼邪
柳树不言
却能相互交谈

柳成荫
柳如烟
问垂柳
你为何叫哭啼的柳树？

朋友相聚，朋友相去
往事如烟
做你该做之事
念你该念之人

在中国，清明时人们就折上柳枝插在门口，因为他们相信这样就能驱逐在清明节出来游荡的鬼魂。传说，在清明节这一天，阎王爷就许可鬼魂们回到阳间。由于人们并不是那么乐意，所以就用柳枝驱逐他们。

柳树还能够交谈，害虫叮咬柳树时，柳树会接着发出一种特殊的气味，告诉其他的柳树害虫来了。所有的柳树叶子会产生一种对害虫产生刺激的化学物质，害虫受不了就飞走了。通过这种方式，柳树就能保护自己不受害虫的危害。
