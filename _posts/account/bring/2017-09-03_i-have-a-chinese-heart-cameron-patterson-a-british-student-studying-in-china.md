康可，英文名Cameron Patterson，出生于1995年1月30日，复旦大学国际关系和物理专业的英国留学生（现在应已毕业）。英国兰卡斯特大学孔子学院的学生，从小就跟随父母从英国来到中国学习生活。2015年第十四届“汉语桥”大赛的亚军。今年9月30康可要回兰卡斯特开始大三，还有两年就毕业了!

这已经是康可在中国读书的第9个年头，地道的中文源于康可9岁开始就跟随在中国任教的父母一起，在山西大同、湛江等地生活学习，9年间除了体验到地道的中式教育外，康可要还找到自己的中国偶像。

2011年，回到英国攻读高中和大学的康可，敲开了孔子学院的大门，康可所在的兰卡斯特大学2011年成立了孔子学院，开设汉语学分课程和辅修专业，为推动汉语文化延伸搭建平台，结合自己的中英文语言优势的康可，开始陆续参与到孔子学院中英文化交流的主持和推广中。

Cameron Patterson, born on January 30, 1995, is a British student studying in Fudan University, majoring in international relations and Physics (The British student maybe have graduated now), and also a student of Confucius Institute of the University of Lancaster. He came second in the fourteenth Chinese Language Bridge Competition in 2015. As a child, he came to China with his parents from the UK for studying and life. He will return to Lancaster on September 30 this year and graduate in two years!

This is the ninth year that Patterson has been studying in China. At the age of nine, he went to study and live together with his parents who taught in China, where he received the authentic Chinese education for nine years. Besides mastering the standard Chinese, he wants to find his own Chinese idol.

In 2011, Patterson returned to the Uk for his high school and college program, and knocked on the door of Confucius Institute. The University of Lancaster established the Confucius Institute in 2011, offering Chinese credit courses and minor majors. In order to build a platform to promote Chinese cultural extension, Patterson, making full use of his advantages of both Chinese and English language, began to participate in the host and promotion of Chinese and English cultural exchanges of Confucius Institute.

2015年10月，康可以孔子学院学生代表的身份受邀在英国孔子学院年会开幕式上表演，康可特地选择一篇能表达自己中国情结的《念奴娇•追思焦裕禄》。

现在，作为英国卡迪夫公学的校友大使，康可奔赴中国各地，为家长交流在中英两国的学习经历和心得，向留学生推广传统文化和汉语传播。

康可说他最重要的人生阶段是在中国住的，有时候他会把英国看成第二故乡，而把中国看作是他的家乡。

In October 2015, he was invited to perform at the opening ceremony of the annual meeting of the British Confucius Institute as a student representative of the Confucius Institute. He specially chose the poetry “In Memory of Jiao Yulu”, which could express his Chinese complex.

Now, as the British Cardiff School’s Alumni ambassador, Patterson goes to all parts of China, sharing learning experience and experience in China and Britain with parents, and popularising traditional culture and Chinese among foreign students.

He said that he had spent his most important stage of life in China, and sometimes he would regard Britain as his second hometown, and China his hometown.

附：《念奴娇•追思焦裕禄》

《念奴娇•追思焦裕禄》是时任中共福州市委书记习近平于1990年7月15日所作的一首词，最先发表在1990年7月16日的《福州晚报》上。

念奴娇•追思焦裕禄

魂飞万里，盼归来，此水此山此地。百姓谁不爱好官？把泪焦桐成雨。生也沙丘，死也沙丘，父老生死系。暮雪朝霜，毋改英雄意气！

依然月明如昔，思君夜夜，肝胆长如洗。路漫漫其修远矣，两袖清风来去。为官一任，造福一方，遂了平生意。绿我涓滴，会它千顷澄碧。
