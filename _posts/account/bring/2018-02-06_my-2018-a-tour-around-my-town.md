Hi, my dear steemians. This is my entry for @anomadsoul’s contest: My 2018: a tour around my town. 

First, I would like to introduce myself and Mount Taishan before showing you around my hometown.

Brief Biography of @bring— Old Wu, or 老吴 in Chinese: Old Wu, male, born on Dec. 12, 1968, Chinese nationality, is a good man and has been studying English for over 30 years. He teaches himself English, and he does not believe in fate, so he keeps working hard. Humorous and optimistic, he will become your good friend.

You must have heard of Mount Taishan in China, although you have never been to Taian City, Shandong Province, China, where Mount Taishan is located. 

Mount Taishan is loccated in the center of Shandong Province spanning the cities of Taian and Jinan, extending for a total area of 250 square kilometers. Mount Taishan is a symbol of loftiness and grandeur with abruptly rising majestic peaks and crests. Its sceneries are spectacular. 

Mount Taishan boasts of a wealth of natural legacies. It is a famed Sacred Mountain valuable in aesthetics, science and cultural history.

You expect to meet an old man, for a person at the age of 50 may look like an old man. With a young heart I look much younger.

I was born in a poor family in a village about 15km to the east of Mount Taishan, where I spent many happy days of my childhood, catching the grasshopper in the field and fishing in the river. I grew up eating pancakes made by my mother, for more details about Taishan pancake please click here  https://steemit.com/food/@bring/6rhuxz-taishan-pancake

When I have grown up I moved to the town, where I got married and had a daughter, who is now 23 years old and works in Shanghai. So I take Daixi Garden （岱西花园）—the residential area I am now living in as my second hometown.

Surrounded by mountains on three sides, Daixi Garden faces Taishan Vocational Nursing College on the fourth side. Close to the Garden is a small reservoir, later changed into the name of Penghu Bay. 

The terrain here is lower in the central region and high in the border region, like a basin, scattered with Country Garden, Daixi Garden, Penghu Bay, Sunshine Villa, and other residential areas and high-grade villas.

With green hills and blue waters, Daixi Garden is far away from the downtown, ten minutes drive from Beijing-Shanghai Expressway and Beijing-Shanghai High Speed Railway Taian Station. Nice and cool in summer, with flowers in blossoms and the gurgling water, isn’t it the Peach Garden the people have been longing for in their minds?




In the north of Daixi Garden there is an old well full of clear and sweet spring running perennially. The nearby residents come all the way to draw water from the well ever day. Surely we enjoy the benefits of a favorable position.

On the nearby stone bridge some farmers sometimes take their vegetables for sale. Every afternoon it turns into a busy market, where you can find many local products such as Taishan jujube, chestnut, walnut, peanut, pear, and even Taishan Ganoderma lucidum. Once, I also found someone selling sour and sweet mountain dates.

The goods are genuine and the price fair. With streams of cheerful people busily coming and going, it is truly the Peach Garden in the world. 

No matter where you live, as long as the people live and work in peace with social stability, it's a good place worthwhile to go.
