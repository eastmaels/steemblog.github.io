**Ⅱ. Promote School-Enterprise Cooperation and Meet the Needs of Serving Transformation, Upgrading, and Development of Local Economy**

School enterprise cooperation is the only way to cultivate high skilled talents to meet the needs of the society. So we must break the closed mode of running a school, "going outside" and "inviting inside". From "school-enterprise combination" to "school-enterprise integration", through a variety of forms such as "order" cultivating, work-study combination, building the titled class jointly, we have built a close school-enterprise cooperation platform, effectively promoting the quality of cultivation of skilled talents. Our school has successively introduced Taian Jie Cheng Industry & Trade Co., Ltd, Tai'an Quanshifa Machinery Manufacturing Co., Ltd, which not only manufacture products, but also meet the student's internship teaching, thus solving both the students' internship training and the problem of insufficient funding for schools. It is really a way to kill two birds with one stone.

We should set up the school-enterprise cooperation construction committee. Taking the construction committee as the breakthrough point, we should carry out all-round, in-depth, multi-form cooperation with enterprises, and continue to explore the cooperation mode of realizing the close docking of schools and enterprise. School-enterprise cooperation construction committees have been set up successively in our school’s majors such as mechnical & electrical engineering, numerical control, computer, modern agriculture, preschool education. Enterprises’ management elite and technology backbone are invited to school to give professional guidance, achieving good results.

Firstly, in the aspect of professional construction and curriculum setting, the establishment of speciality construction coordination mechanism dominated by enterprises should be explored, and training courses should be developed mainly depending on enterprises.

Secondly, in the teaching faculty construction, the teaching staff based on school enterprise integration should be established, that is, the teaching faculty include school teachers, enterprise technicians, and senior technicians. They not only take the teaching responsibility to cultivate the students, but also participate in some of the technological innovation and scientific and technological projects of enterprises. Their teaching ability, teaching effect, and job performance are jointly assessed by the school and enterprises.

Thirdly, in practical teaching, a variety of ways have been introduced such as establishing training base by inviting enterprises to school, practice teaching management with school enterprise integration, setting up teaching area in the factory, forming the practice training base with the mode of school in factory, factory in school, and front shop, back factory. 

Fourthly, in the ability evaluation, the system of evaluation of students' professional ability by enterprises has been introduced. According to the progress of teaching, the enterprise experts in conjunction with the appraisal organization carry out the evaluation of the students’ professional ability stage by stage, such as our school's Lenovo 3C order class. In this class the evaluation of students is made in accordance with the talent evaluation mechanism of Lenovo Group.

We have introduced the talent evaluation program of German’s automobile application and maintenance to our school’s ordered class with Beijing Sino-German Know-How.  Students will be able to get the German qualification certificate after passing the assessment of employment.

**Ⅲ.Strengthen the Connotation Construction, and Lay a Solid Foundation for Serving Local Economic and Social Development**

How to promote the level of professional construction, and improve the quality of skilled talents training, is the eternal theme of the connotation construction of technical education. To strengthen the connotation construction is, focusing on the professional construction and high skilled talents training, to try hard to cultivate  knowledge-oriented, technical and compound talents according to market demand and employment orientation.

1.Strengthening the Construction of Teaching Staff

The level of teaching staff is the key to the connotation construction. Adhering to the policy of "making good use of existing talents, introducing urgently required talents, cultivating backbone of talents", constantly improving the mechanism of"introducing, cultivating, using, and maintaining talents", through the implementation of relevant measures, we have expanded the scale of teaching staff, optimize the structure and strengthen the construction of of teaching staff, thus forming a high quality faculty group with a reasonable age structure, coordinated distribution of professional title, and a high proportion of double-type teachers.

We have selected, supported and encouraged teachers to actively participate in continuing learning, and constantly improve their theoretical level and practical ability through a variety of ways such as overseas training, national and provincial backbone teachers training, factory practice, and on-the-job training. At present, the school has 288 professional teachers, 162 teachers of professional class and practice guidance, 136 double-type teachers. More than 200 batches of teachers have participated in training successively, the overall quality of teachers has been comprehensively promoted.

2.Improving the Quality of Education and Teaching

We should always take improving the quality of personnel training as the core of the connotation construction, and quality of education and teaching as the starting point and end result.of all college work. Professional skills teaching is the foundation of technical colleges. With students being the center, and according to the standard of vocational skill, we should set up the work situation as much as possible, help students improve their interest, and enhance the sense of responsibility and sense of accomplishment. In strengthening professional education at the same time, we should pay attention to the quality education, cultivate students' quality of professional ethics, and improve the students' Ideological and political morality. At the same time, taking campus cultural activities and social practice activities as the main content, we should improve student's cultural accomplishment.

In short, high skilled talents are the current support of industrial 4.0 manufacturing, and the fundamental guarantee for the core competitiveness of enterprises. Technical education is the basis of high skilled talents training. In order to improve the quality of skilled talents, we should do a good job of technical education to provide service for transformation and upgrading of local economy.
