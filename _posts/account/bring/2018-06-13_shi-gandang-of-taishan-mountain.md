An extraordinary person named Shi Gandang ever lived under the foot of Taishan Mountain in ancient times. Shi Gandang was a master of martial arts with bold and honest personality.

Ther lived a Zhang’s family in the Town of Dawenkou in south of Taian County. Zhang had a 16-year-old daughter who was very beautiful and free from vulgarity. However, whereever the sun set onto the mountain, there blew a stream of evil wind from the southeast direction, which blew the beautiful girl to emaciation with sallow complexion and unbearable weakness. It was of no avail for her to visit well-known doctors and take good medicines. Later, old members of Zhang’s family heard that there was a brave man named Shi Gandang on the Taishan Mountain, so they invited him to help them eliminating the monster.

Shi Gandang succeeded in fightening the monster to flee at the mere sight of the oncoming force just by exercising a minor tact. But soon afterwards, the monster that ran away to the South pestered people on the seashore, Shi Gandang chased over. In this way, the monster fled away whenever seeing Shi Gandang, whereas Shi Gandang chased after the monster as farther as he could. Finally, as Shi Gandang ran hard, he hit upon an idea to carve his own name on stones of Taishan Mountain and place it at others’ gates or walls, where the monster did dare to come again,which was efficacious indeed as expected. Untill today, people there still use “Shi Gandang” to overwhelm monsters and eliminate evilness. The stone of “Shi Gandang of Taishan Mountain” in your hands is carved from a stone of Taishan Mountain, which helps you dominating your house, avoiding evilness, driving ghosts and protecting your safety.

古时候泰山脚下住一神人，姓石名敢当，武功高强，勇猛正直。

泰安南的大汶口镇里有户张姓人家，十六岁的女儿长得漂亮脱俗。可每到太阳压山，就从东南方向刮来一股妖风，吹得姑娘面黄肌瘦，虚弱不堪，拜名医吃好药也无济于事。张家老人听说泰山上有个石敢当很勇敢，就去请他除妖。

石敢当略施小法，吓得妖怪望风而逃。可不久，逃到南方的妖怪在海边缠人，石敢当就追了过去。就这样，妖怪见石敢当就逃，越逃越远，石敢当就越追越远。石敢当终于跑累了，他想了个办法，用泰山石刻上自己的名字，放在人家门口或墙上，妖怪就不敢来了，果然灵验。直到今天，现在人依然用“石敢当”镇妖除邪。“泰山石敢当”是用泰山石刻成，为您镇宅、辟邪、驱鬼、保平安。
