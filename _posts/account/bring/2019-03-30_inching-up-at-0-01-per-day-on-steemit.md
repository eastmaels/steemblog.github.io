Brief Biography of @bring— Old Wu, or 老吴 in Chinese: Old Wu, male, born on Dec. 12, 1968, Chinese nationality, is a good man and has been studying English for over 30 years. He teaches himself English, and he never believes in fate, so he keeps working hard. Humorous and optimistic, he will become your good friend. 

I joined Steemit on July 31, 2017, with the reputation reaching 62 on October 19, 2017, and 63 on February 9, 2018. So far, more than a year has passed, the reputation is only 63.67, and more than 20 days ago it was 63.48. That is to say, in one year, the reputation  has only risen by 0.5. Imagine a snail would have climbed to its destination in a year.

Many thanks to @chinadaily for his post, "[Daily Update] Overview of Active User Information in Chinese Area in the Past Seven Days", which enables me to have a clear understanding of my daily reputation. Every morning at 8 o'clock, the first thing is to find this post and see how my reputation changes.

From rep. 62 to rep.63, it took me about four months to advance, that is, gaining about 0.01 a day. Although Steemit has been severely affected by the sharp drop in the value of Bitcoin since January 2018, I have continued to write and, although slowly, have reached 63. But in the days to come, the value of Bitcoin has fallen horribly, and Steemit has become more depressed. The single $1's earning of every post has become even a luxury hope. Like most people, I left the Steemit.

By the end of 2017, I had planned to raise my rep. from 63 to 67 in my New Year's Goal for 2018. @rivalhw and @lemooljiang left messages behind the posts to encourage me, thinking that this is without problem.

But I didn't hold on to it. I started to be active in the last 20 days, although I found that the rep. was only increased by 0.01 per day. However in this way can my rep.be raised by 1 in about 100 days, at least 3 a year. If I could stick to it in 2018, even if I gained 0.01 in my rep. every day, I should have achieved 67 rep. by now.

It's a pity that I gave up because the gains were too small. In the future, it is certain to reach rep. 66 by the end of 2019 and rep. 70 by the end of 2020.

Lu Xun's marriage with Zhu'an was arranged by his mother. Which Mr. Lu Xun did not like. In order to win Lu Xun's heart, Zhu'an waited silently, like a snail in the backyard, climbing slowly, believing that one day she would climb to the roof.

Suddenly, I felt that I would learn from this snail and climb up slowly, though slowly and hard, one day I would reach the end.

And with perseverance I will cerntainly get there.

Steemit上每天0.01的爬行

我是2017年7月31日加入到Steemit的，2017年10月19日升至62级，2018年2月9日升至63级。可迄今一年多的时间过去了，级别仅是63.67，而在20多天前还是63.48。也就是说，一年的时间里，级别仅仅上升了0.5。如是一只蜗牛，一年的时间也该早已爬到目的地了。

非常感谢前辈@chinadaily的帖子“ [Daily Update]近七日中文区活跃用户信息速览”，能够让我对自己每天的级别有了清楚的了解。每天早上8点，第一件事情就是找到前辈的这篇帖子，去看一看自己的级别变化情况。

从62级到63级，我用了大约4个月的时间，也就是每天大约0.01的前进。尽管自2018年1月开始，币值大跌，Steemit受到严重影响，但我还是坚持写作，也尽管慢，还是升至了63级。可在以后的日子里，币值跌得惨不忍睹，Steemit也变得更加萧条，每篇帖子的收益连个位数都成了一种奢望。我也像大多数人一样，渐渐销声匿迹了。

2017年底的时候，我曾在自己的2018新年目标中，计划把等级自63级升至67级。前辈@rivalhw 、@lemooljiang在帖子后面留言，对我加以鼓励，认为这是不成问题的。

可我竟没有坚持住，最近20多天才开始活跃起来，尽管我发现级别每天只是0.01的提高。可细细一算，大约100天就能提高一个等级，一年也至少提升三个等级了。如果在2018年来我能够坚持下来，就算每天0.01的进步，到今天也应该有67级了。

积少成多，集腋成裘，只是可惜，我因小而放弃了。展望未来，照这个速度坚持下去，2019年底达到66级是有把握的，那么2020年底，是有望达到70级的。

鲁迅与原配朱安的婚姻是其母亲包办的，鲁迅先生并不喜欢，而朱安为了赢得鲁迅的认可，一直默默等着，就像后院里的一只蜗牛，慢慢地爬着，相信总有一天会爬到房顶的。

我忽然觉得，自己也要做这只蜗牛，慢慢地向上爬，尽管缓慢，艰难，总有一天会爬到终点的。

只是，要坚持，坚持住，才会有希望。
