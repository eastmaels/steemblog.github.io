Steemit is a platform, or a stage where everyone can show their talent and skill, and after the performance, when they return back to their seats, they are the judges. The score or pending payout from the performance is based on the number of people who give you an upvote and their SP (Steemit Power). Whether the judges agree with your performance, it depends on your skill and the judges' preference.

Some players go on the stage to great applause, and when they raise their arm in a call for action, many people respond, attracting hundreds of followers. To my surprise, there are also some performances (articles), the income of which is several hundred dollars, even thousand dollars. I assiduously practise writing articles and even translate them into English, but the final income is less than 0.2 dollars. In contrast, to be honest, I feel that it's a little bit unfair to me. But think about it, and I feel relieved.

What is in existence is reasonable. Although it is immaterialism, there is a truth in it. It’s an ill wind that blows nobody good. The Chinese translation：无论是怎样的歪风，也不见得每个人都吹得不舒服。Or we can say in Chinese: 无论怎样的正风，也不见得每个人都吹得舒服。Similarly, it’s a good workman that never blunders. 

Since you have joined Steemit, you must obey the rules of Steemit, and you should play by the rules, or you will be kicked out. 

In my hour of darkness, my brother @wnh518518 suggested that I should read carefully the articles with high pending payout and follow their example. 

I think it’s beyond my capability. Technical analysis writings of Steemit and travel articles with wonderful pictures around the world are all unable for me to catch up with. Furthermore, I have always thought that the experience of success is not replicable, or suitable for me.

What I can do is work in a down-to-earth way, study hard off the stage to lay a good foundation, and give full play to my skills on the stage. 

As for the applause and scores, it's not what I can control.

Feeling bogged down in it, one becomes very angry about the injustice suffered, and remains backward and has no urge to make progress. All in all, he or she is deeply involved. 

The income of shooting and ads by some stars and well-known people is hard for a farmer to reach for life. As a result, the farmer scolds the unfairness of the society and the injustice of the system, but does not think about how to get rich. Unable to become a famous person, I will not do as that farmer, and will not daydream of getting rich overnight. Steadfast, diligent and enterprising, I will live my life. Not a life in vain!

Brief Biography of @bring— Old Wu, or 老吴 in Chinese: Old Wu, male, born on Dec. 12, 1968, Chinese nationality, is a good man and has been studying English for over 30 years. He teaches himself English, and he does not believe in fate, so he keeps working hard. Humorous and optimistic, he will become your good friend.
