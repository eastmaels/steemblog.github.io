When a man reads much, he has many words to say, some feelings to express, and finally some articles to write. Of course, he or she can share the joy of the heart with his sworn friends or her girlfriends. But in the end you will find that the understanding listeners are extremely rare, and some things can only be said to yourself, so there will be a diary and some writing.

“Like a fishbone getting stuck in the throat –it is necessary to give vent to my pent-up feelings.” I can't find the source of this sentence. I vaguely remember that the writer Zhao Shuli has made such a similar statement in an interview. 

一个人书读得多了，自然有许多话要说，有些许感受要表达，最后也就有文章要写。当然，他（她）也可以把自己内心的喜悦分享给或把伤痛倾诉给其铁杆兄弟或者闺蜜。但最终会发现，善解人意的倾听者终是凤毛麟角，加之有些东西只能说给自己听，所以，就有了日记，有了写作。

“如鲠在喉，那种不得不发，不吐为快的情绪表达。”我已无法查找这句话的出处了，我隐约记得作家赵树理在接受采访时，曾有过这样类似的表述。

What exactly is writing for? After all, it is to please yourself, not to please others. It is to express the passionate feelings, dispel all your inner pains and anger, all for yourself, rather than get some garish things, make a fuss, and even give up your insistence in order to attract readers, upvote and money.

I am reluctant to see this phenomenon on Steemit:

All day long, wondering how to set an attractive subject, write articles that people like, and put on dizzy beautiful pictures.

What's the difference between this approach and playing to the gallery?

The writer Chen Zhongshi spent six years in finishing the writing of "White Deer Plain”, including two years of gathering materials for his book.

Therefore, people who really love reading and writing can only calm down and adhere to their original intention, never following others’ words or walking. 

写作，究竟是为了什么？说到底，就是为了悦己，而不是悦人。为了表达慷慨激扬之情，为了排遣积郁内心的痛苦和愤懑，是为了自己。而绝不是弄些花里胡哨的东西，无病呻吟，甚至放弃自己的坚持而一味地去模仿，来博取众人的眼球、喝彩、点赞和美金。

整日琢磨着如何定个吸引人眼球的题目、写众人喜欢的题材文章、配上让人晕眩的美图，我不愿在Steemit上看到这样的现象。

这种做法和哗众取宠有什么不一样？

陈忠实花了六年才写成《白鹿原》，光查资料就用了两年。

所以，真正对读书写作有所热爱的人，才能够静下心来，才能够坚持自己的初衷，才不会人云亦云，亦步亦趋。
