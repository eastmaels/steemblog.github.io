Liu Lianren, a native of Gaomi County, Shandong Province, was caught by the Japanese in September 1944, and then taken to a coal mine in Hokkaido as a coolie. In July 1945, he took the opportunity to run away to the deep mountains and forests in Hokkaido, where he stayed for 13 years untill he was found by a Japanese hunter. He didn’t know it was not long after he escaped that Japan announced unconditional surrender. He returned home in 1958, but he was not used to sleeping on the bed, just squatting all night in the corner... After a long time, he managed to live like a normal person. 

In order to find justice and dignity for him, with the support of the whole nation and the help of Japanese friends, in March 1996, Liu Lianren filed a lawsuit against the Japanese government who still pleaded not guilty and did not compensate, and went to Japan to make statement before the court for three times.

On September 2, 2000, Liu Lianren died with hatred. Before his death, he told his son, "After I die, you must continue the lawsuit against Japan. If you die, your son will go on. We must bring the case to the end!"

His famous remark is that “One should have integrity, ambition and courage.” 

刘连仁，山东高密人，1944年9月被日本人抓去到北海道某煤矿做苦力。1945年7月，他乘机逃到北海道深山老林里，一呆就是13年，后被一猎人发现。他并不知道他逃跑后没多久，日本就宣布投降了。1958年回国，可他已不习惯躺在床上睡觉，只是整夜蹲在角落里……很长时间以后，他才能像正常人一样地生活。

为讨回公道，1996年3月，在全国人民的支持和日本友人的帮助下，刘连仁向仍然不认罪不赔偿的日本政府提起诉讼，并3次赴日上法庭陈述。

2000年9月2日，刘连仁含恨去世。临终，他叮嘱儿子说：“我死之后，你要把和日本的官司打下去，你死了还有孙子，一定要把官司打到底！”

“做人要有骨气、志气和勇气。”是他的名言。
