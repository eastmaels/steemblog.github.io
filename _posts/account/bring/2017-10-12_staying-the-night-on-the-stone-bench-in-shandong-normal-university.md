Every struggle course is a history of suffering, but with the passage of time, those stories that have been engraved on your mind will become a treasure that pushes you forward.

In 1999, I got a university diploma in higher education self-study examination, and got the qualification to apply for a bachelor's degree. But it required to take an examination of a foreign language for obtaining such degree.

One day at the end of August 2000, I went to the examination center of Shandong Normal University ahead of time. The traffic wasn't as developed as it is now. It's only 17 minutes from Tai'an to Ji'nan by high-speed rail. It was the first time I came to the university campus, everything was so fresh and the atmosphere of learning was so strong. I turned around in the campus. It was really fascinating.

It was getting dark. I had to look for somewhere to stay in the evening. The little hotels outside the campus were unsafe, so I decided to stay inside the school. It was a pity that the apartment in the school was full, and even the shared house was full (15 yuan / person). I was sitting on the stone bench in the campus, thinking of the test tomorrow, and wanting to rest early. Taking off the short-sleeved shirt and covering myself up, I lay down and fell asleepâ€”the Shanshan brand shirt was given to me by the elder aunt of my daughter, and I was too fond to wear it on weekdays. When I woke up, it was already three or four in the morning, after all, it was at the end of August, I felt a bit cold in the middle of the night.

I got up and walked up and down the square where stood a statue of Chairman Mao. Up until six or seven there were pedestrians on the road at last, and the snack stand at the school gate opened. I had breakfast and prepared for the examination.

In 2001, I received the Bachelor of Arts degree.
