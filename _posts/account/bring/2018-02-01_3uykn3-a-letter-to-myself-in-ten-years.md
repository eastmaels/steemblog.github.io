Comrade Wu,

I still call you “Comrade” within the Party, and after all, as a Party member, you can not be divorced from the Party organization.

This year you are already in your fifties, the year of knowing your destiny according to the Chinese saying, and you will be sixty years old in ten years. At that time, your white hair will show its original appearance. Do you want to continue to have it dyed? When you were going to graduate from the secondary school in 1988, you began to have your hair dyed, fearing that a young person with grey hair looked older and would affect your brilliant image. Thirty years have passed since then. It is surprising to meet an old man in his 60s with dark hair. You had better not have your hair dyed. 

I think you won't wear glasses when you look at this letter. Strange to say, reading books and sitting in front of the computer all day, you still have very good eyesight. Just like doing the homework when young, you wrote while humming naucous pop songs, as if you were composing a piece of music. 

When you finished your homework, the song was over. Unfortunately a hole was blasted into the table on which I often wrote my homework when my younger brother @xiaoshancun set off fireworks on it during the Spring Festival, only to be fit for nothing but the fire.

You do not have many hobbies, of course, you have no bad habits and you still have a regular life. You will be learning English, translating, and writing on Steemit at that time. These are all your hobbies, and you will not discard them.

When a person is fifity, he should know his destiny, but you would not believe in fate. Even in your 60s and 80s, you can not change your stubborn temper. Honest and upright, you cannot see injustice without heating. At the age of 60, you should retire to enjoy the happiness of a family union.

At that time you would take your grandson (or granddaughter) to go out to play. You walk in the front with your hands clasped behind your back, and the child follows you in the back in the same way. An old man and a child, isn’t it a landscape? Isn’t it your daughter’s childhood?

You will keep some flowers and just looking at the green leaves is also a kind of enjoyment.

The bookcase in the house is too small, buy a big one. During the ten years you will buy many books. You put the books in the bookcase for you love them and make a home for them, not for others to see. 
You are sure to think about doing translation at the age of 60, and you would say that some Japanese people are still to start a business in China at the age of 70. Act according to your capability!

You are still particular about details, and mopping the floor bright—these habits cannot be changed easily. Exercising your body is a good thing. No need changing.

Your wife is still nagging. When you were scolded by your wife while just getting married, you soon fell asleep. When getting old, you are feeling uncomfortable without your wife’s nagging.

The only thing that I am worrying about is your teeth, for you have lost a few under 50. You should pay more attention, or you would have no pleasure in eating. 

Out of sight and out of mind. As a common person, you have nothing to worry about, and have no sense of loss. 

When you get to the destination, you should get off, or you'll miss the stop.

You will be as frankly kind and merry as ever. After all, a sixty years old man is still a young man according to current standards.

**Brief Biography of @bring— Old Wu, or 老吴 in Chinese: Old Wu, male, born on Dec. 12, 1968, Chinese nationality, is a good man and has been studying English for over 30 years. He teaches himself English, and he does not believe in fate, so he keeps working hard. Humorous and optimistic, he will become your good friend. **
