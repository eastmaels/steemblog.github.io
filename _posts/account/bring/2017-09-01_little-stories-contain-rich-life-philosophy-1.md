一、名人似乎都是孤独的，这种孤独源于其内心深处的隐忧与暗伤。

 Celebrities seem to be lonely, and this kind of loneliness comes from their secret worries and invisible injuries in the depth of their heart.

二、人的一生，取得小成功要和环境作斗争，要想取得大成功，必须和自己作斗争。

If a person wants to achieve a small success in his life, he should fight against the environment, but if he wants a great success, he should fight against himself.

三、阎锡山统治山西38年，始终屹立不倒，可见其手段，他常挂在嘴边的话就是:“事到危难宜放胆，人非知己莫谈心。”

Shanxi Province, under the rule of Yan Xishan, lasted for 38 years, from which we can see Yan’s strategy and means. He often said, “In times of danger, one should be bold. Don’t have a heart-to-heart talk with a person who is not your bosom friend.”

四、吴承恩在《西游记》中塑造了一个没有多少面目的沙僧，在其西天取经的路上，沙僧常说的只有三句话：“大师兄，师傅说的对”、“二师兄，大师兄说的对”、“大师兄、二师兄，师傅说的对”。

Wu Chengen created Monk Sha with no features in "Journey to the West". During the journey Monk Sha often said only three sentences--- “Big Brother, Master is right.” “Second Brother, Big Brother is right.” “Big Brother and Second Brother, Master is right.”

五、杨厨师是我原单位食堂的厨师，据说达到了一级水平，人送外号“杨一级”。有一日，我科室老领导走在前面，杨厨师在后面喊道：“兄弟，等等我，我给你说个事。”杨厨师急急赶了上来，几乎是把嘴贴在了我老领导的耳朵上：“哎，兄弟，我告诉你啊，咱不知己不拉，这菜炒不熟是真不好吃啊！”

Master Yang was the chef of my former unit’s canteen, who was said to have reached the first level, and the people sent the nickname “First-class Yang ". One day, my department head walked in front, and Chef Yang shouted in the back: "My brother, wait a moment, I'll tell you something." Chef Yang hurried up, putting his mouth so closely to one ear of my deparment head, "Hey, Brother, I tell you, ah, if we were not bosom friends, I would not tell you such a thing. If dishes are not well done, they really taste bad.”


六、通读英汉词典，发现一现象：Dutch 一词麻烦多多。Dutch 荷兰人（的）、荷兰语（的），与其构成的短语意思常常不那么令人愉快。

Reading through the English-Chinese dictionary, I find a kind of phenomenon: "Dutch" is in a lot of trouble. The phrases made with  "Dutch" often have negative meaning.

Dutch act 自杀

Dutch auction 开价甚高然后逐渐降低的拍卖

Dutch bargain 不牢固或不公平的交易

Dutch comfort 退一步着想而得到的安慰（阿Q 精神？）

Dutch courage 酒后之勇

Dutch treat 各自付费的聚餐

Go Dutch 各自付钱

Talk to sb like a Dutch uncle 严厉斥责

Double Dutch 莫名其妙的话

In Dutch 得罪上司

你看，这些短语哪有一个好的意义？

Look, there is no good meaning in these phrases.

就连Dutch door 也是上下两部分各自分别开关的门。各干各的！

Even Dutch door also refers to a door with the upper part and lower part switching respectively. Each is doing its own thing!

后来才明白，原来英国人在海外扩张时曾遇到荷兰人的有力竞争，战败后也曾遭到荷兰人的屠杀。所以，英国人对荷兰人很是反感，反映到语言上，就产生了这种现象。

Later it became clear that the British had experienced strong competition from the Dutch when they were expanding overseas, and that they had been slaughtered by the Dutch after the defeat. Therefore, the British are very disgusted with the Dutch, which was reflected in the language. Thus this phenomenon has come into being.
