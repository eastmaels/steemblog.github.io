When the underground project in one urban area was constructed, a rusted wire was dug out from the deep underground, and the engineers of the city proudly said, "This shows many years ago our ancestors had wired communications." The engineers of another city shook their heads disapprovingly, “But what of that? Once in our construction, not a wire was dug out when we got deep into the ground. What did that mean, do you know? This shows that our ancestors had realized wireless communications in very early days." 

一城市工程施工时，在很深的地下挖到一锈迹斑斑的线缆，该城市工程人员便自豪地说：“这说明我们的祖先在多少年前就已实现了有线通讯。”另一城市的工程人员不以为然地说：“这有什么，有一次在我们那里施工，挖到很深的地方连根电线也没挖到，这说明了我们的祖先在很早的时候就已经实现了无线通讯。”
