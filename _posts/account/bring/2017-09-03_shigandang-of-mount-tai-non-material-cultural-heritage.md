泰山石敢当是石敢当的传承与发展。泰山石敢当习俗是国家非物质文化遗产之一,是我国带有民族性的民俗事象; 它源于上古时期的灵石崇拜。泰山石敢当习俗经过长期的流变, 至今在中华民族精神层面上尚有较大影响。

Shigandang of Mount Tai is the succession and development of Shigandang. The consuetude of Shigandang of Mount Tai is the national non-material cultural heritage. It is also a natural folk- custom of China. It dates back to the ancient worship of celestial stone. Although the consuetude of Shigandang of Mount Tai is changing with the time, it has great influence on the Chinese people’s spirit.

古时候有很多崇拜，“泰山石敢当”就是其中之一：把刻有【泰山石敢当】的石碑（三尺三寸高），立于桥道要冲或砌于房屋墙壁上，可镇压一切不祥之邪，在民间甚为流行。2006年6月，被列入第一批国家级非物质文化遗产名录。

In ancient times, there are a lot of worship, one of which is " Shigandang of Mount Tai": Stones carved with characters of Shigandang of Mount Tai [泰山石敢当], which are three feet and three inches tall, standing at bridges, communications centres, or being built in the walls of a house, can suppress all evils, which is very popular among the people. 

In June 2006, it was included in the first batch of national non-material cultural heritage list.

这里面有个美丽的传说：

传说泰山脚下的一个村子里住着一个青年，姓石，名敢当。他非常的勇敢，而且同情贫苦的穷人，爱打抱不平。

泰安城南的一户人家，有一个女儿被妖气缠身，变得面黄肌瘦，非常虚弱。其父母便找来了石敢当。石敢当施法赶走了妖怪，可这妖怪跑到其它地方继续作威作福。石敢当想了个办法，请石匠在石头上刻上他的家乡和名字——泰山石敢当，谁家闹妖风，就把这石头放在谁家的门外，妖怪就不敢进去了。

此后， 泰山石敢当降妖的事越传越远。于是，人们纷纷在石头上雕刻“泰山石敢当”五字，立于墙根、街巷、桥头、要冲，以保村宅平安。

There is a beautiful legend in it:

Once there lived a young man whose name was Shigandang in a village at the foot of Mount Tai. He was very brave, and showed sympathy for the poor, always taking up the cudgels for the injured party. A daughter of a family in the south of Tai'an City, who was haunted by a monster, became sallow and emaciated, so her parent sent for Shigandang. Shigandang used a spell to drive the monster away, but the monster went to other places to do evil.Shigandang thought out a way: he asked the mason to carve on the stone his home and name-- Shigandang of Mount Tai [泰山石敢当].The evil-haunted family would put this stone outside of their door, so the monster dared not go in.

Since then, the story of getting rid of the evil spirit by Shigandang of Mount Tai has spread far and wide. Therefore, people all carve the five Chinese characters of Shigandang of Mount Tai [泰山石敢当] on stones, and put them at the foot of  a wall, in the street, road hub and bridge end to keep their village and home safe.
