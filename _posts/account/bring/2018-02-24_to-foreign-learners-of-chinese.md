My dear friends on Steemit, 

If you are a foreigner who are especially interested in Chinese, and determined to learn Chinese well, you are lucky to have us. We are planning to provide some programs for foreign learners of Chinese, especially for English learners. 

Please fell free to offer your valuable suggestions, which will be interesting and meaningful for us to consider in our program. 

Below is my personal advice for you to learn Chinese. Please leave your suggestions, to which we are looking forward. 

First of all, I suggest that you first learn Chinese in your country, going to a university or a training institution. If it is more suitable for you to learn via network, online learning is a good choice.

Of course, you have to study hard, including Chinese grammar, sentence structure, new words, etc. You must learn them by heart, and try to communicate with your Chinese friends, though in simple Chinese, it is also a kind of exercise. In order to write wonderful emails, you have to look up the dictionary for more words regularly.

For a period of time, half a year or a year later, when conditions permit, you may come to China to continue your learning of Chinese. Generally, you have better go to a Chinese training school. Of course, your classmates are probably foreign learners of Chinese from all parts of the world. Chinese classes usually make you feel boring and irritable, because your classmates may not be serious enough to learn Chinese. Even if they get together after class, they are used to communicating in English. It's very bad for you to be eager to learn Chinese well. 

So, I would advise you to go to a place where you can find Chinese people to practice Chinese after class every day, such as parks, university campuses, cafes, etc. Finding a place to sit in the park or campus and taking out your homework to do carefully, you can ask the Chinese people around you for help when you have problems in learning the Chinese characters. Chinese people will be ready to help those foreigners who are learning Chinese. So you can know a lot of Chinese friends through language learnign.

You have to create an environment and get involved in Chinese culture for yourself to learn Chinese, instead staying in your own English environment.

It is recommended that the local dialects of the place you want to go in China should be close to standard Chinese, not like Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong dialects, which are quite different from standard Chinese, commonly called Mandarin.

Your friends in China should be almost Chinese who can't speak English, so your Chinese will be improved very quickly. 

You can teach English in your spare time in China, so you can also earn the money for learning Chinese. In your learning Chinese, whenever you meet unknown words, you should write them down in  the notebook, then look up the dictionary, and sort out systematically, for example, according to verbs, nouns, adjectives, place names, food, animals and so on. 

In this way, you will be able to speak Chinese fluently for a few years in China, and the Chinese will not think you a foreigner. 

Brief Biography of @bring— Old Wu, or 老吴 in Chinese: Old Wu, male, born on Dec. 12, 1968, Chinese nationality, is a good man and has been studying English for over 30 years. He teaches himself English, and he does not believe in fate, so he keeps working hard. Humorous and optimistic, he will become your good friend.
