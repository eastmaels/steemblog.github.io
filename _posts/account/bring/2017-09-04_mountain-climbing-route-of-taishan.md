会当凌绝顶，一览众山小。尽管泰山盘路建于何时已无从考证，但条条大道通罗马，有四条路线可达泰山顶峰。

Only when you stand on the top of the highest mountain, you can see others are small. Every road leads to Rome. Although there is no way to verify when the zigzag mountain roads of Taishan were built, there are four routes to the top of Taishan.

一、红门登山线路：

这是一条古老的登山御道，也是最经典的登山路线，是泰山的精华所在：这条山路中天门以前，以人文景观为主、以自然景观为点缀，分布着较多的古建筑；中天门以后则谷幽壑深、山势峻峭，以自然景观为主，人文景观点缀其间，此段颇多名家名人的题咏诗赋。此路被称作“登天景区”，又因为此路深幽，所以又被称作“幽区”。

此路沿途景点主要有：关帝庙、一天门、孔子登临处、红门宫、醉心石、三义柏、万仙楼、革命烈士纪念碑、风月无边刻石、斗母宫、三观庙、经石峪、总理奉安纪念碑、柏洞、壶天阁、回马岭、药王庙、步天桥、中天门、快活三里、斩云剑、云步桥、五大夫松、望人松、朝阳洞、十八盘、升仙坊、南天门、天街、碧霞祠、唐摩崖、玉皇顶、日观峰等。

Route from the Red Gate

This is the oldest and most classic mountain-climbing route, where the essence of Taishan you can see. From the Red Gate to the Half Way Gate to Heaven, the landscape is dominated by the humanity landscapes, with the natural landscapes as the ornament, and more ancient buildings are distributed. When you clime over the Half Way Gate to Heaven, the landscape is dominated by the natural landscapes, with the humanity landscapes as the ornament, full of inscriptions and poems of famous personage. This road is called "Reaching Heaven Scenic Spot", because this road is deep and quiet, so also known as the "quiet zone".

Main attractions along the route:

Temple of Lord Guan, Yitianmen, Red Gate Palace, Monument to the Revolutionary Martyrs, Half Way Gate to Heaven, the Eighteen Bends, South Gate to Heaven, Azure Cloud Temple,Jade Emperor Peak, Sun Viewing Peak, etc. 

二、天烛峰登山线路：

天烛峰登山线地处泰山东麓，此处远离交通干道，山野气息浓郁。山势的险峻程度稍逊于前山的红门登山路，是泰山人工开发程度最低的景区，原始朴拙，自然风貌保持完好，以奇松、怪石著称，是泰山“奥绝”所在，是喜欢探险游、自助游的最佳线路。

此路沿途景点主要有：天烛胜景坊、洗鹤泉、三折瀑、天烛峰、望天门、玉女圈石、后石坞元君庙、北天门、丈人峰、姊妹松、东西尧观顶等。

Route from Heaven Candle Peak

Located in the east side of Taishan, the route from Heaven Candle Peak is far from the main roads and slightly precipitous compared with the route from the Red Gate, with a strong flavor of mountain fields. As the least developed scenic spot, it is well known for its strangely-shaped pines and queer stones, with its original simplicity and natural style intact. Here you could feel its profoundity and ingenuity. It is also the best route for exploring and self-service travel.

Main attractions along the route:

Heaven Candle Peak, North Gate to Heaven, Sister Pine, Heaven-watching Gate, etc. 

三、天外村登山线路：

天外村天地广场登顶线(泰山西路)位于泰山前山偏西位置，天地广场-中天门-南天门一线。天地广场至中天门有盘山公路，从中天门到泰山极顶有两种选择：徒步或者乘坐缆车！

此路沿途景点主要有：天地广场、冯玉祥墓、龙潭水库、白龙池、长寿桥、竹林寺、中天门。中天门以后如果步行与红门路后半程相同：快活三里、斩云剑、云步桥、五大夫松、望人松、朝阳洞、十八盘、升仙坊、南天门。

Route from Village Beyond Heaven

Located in the west of Taishan, the route starts from the World Plaza in Village Beyond Heaven, to the Middle Gate to Heaven, then to the South Gate to Heaven. You can take the tourist bus to the Middle Gate to Heaven, and there are two choices from the Middle Gate to Heaven to the top of Taishan: on foot or by cable car.

Main attractions along the route:

World Plaza, Tomb of Feng Yuxiang, Longtan Reservoir, the Middle Gate to Heaven, etc.

四、桃花峪登山线路：

这条线路位于泰山西北麓，是条现代化的登山线路，几乎可以脚不沾地到达山顶：从桃花峪有公路相通到桃花源索道站，然后从桃花源乘索道到达山顶。这条登山游览路景点较少，不是理想的步游路线。

此路沿途景点主要有：桃花峪、彩石溪、桃花源等，此路线以自然风光为主，被称为“秀区”。

Route from Peach Blossom Valley:

Located in the northwest of Taishan, the route from Peach Blossom Valley is a modern climbing route. You can take the tourist bus from the Peach Blossom Valley to the Peach Garden cableway station, where you take the cable car to the top of the mountain. With few tourist attractions along the route, it is not an ideal walking route.

Dominated by natural sights, this route mainly includes such attractions as Peach Blossom Valley, Colorful Stone Creek, Peach Garden, etc.
