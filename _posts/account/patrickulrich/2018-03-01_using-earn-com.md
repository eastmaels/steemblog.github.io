### Have you used [Earn.com](earn.com/patrickulrich/referral/?a=v4nfo4z647k1psw1) yet?

As an everyday user it is a great way to get rewarded for sharing your thoughts and opinions on some surveys they will send out. As a business, it's an excellent way to get replies from users without randomly sending tons of random emails out.

#### How it works!

After signing up Earn will allow you to join different lists based on your interests or skills. Some of these lists may be a bit exclusive, like CEOs or media personalities, but there's even lists for basic bitcoin users. After you sign up for a list and get approved you just wait. 

Once a business is ready to start sending messages out, it will order from a list and give a payment they are willing to pay for a response. This can vary but a lot of the messages I've seen have been around the $1 mark. At this point everyone on this list will receive a message stating they have a message worth $1 waiting for their response. After they sign in an complete they questionaire their account is then credited with $1 worth of BTC.

You can then withdraw this BTC to your own personal wallet or you can forward it to a charity. I've done this multiple times and it is extremely easy!

#### That's not all!

Earn also acts as an excellent email bouncer. What this means is that you can have spam email sent a message requiring them to pay to connect with you. This works by syncing your Gmail account up that whenever someone sends you an email, that is outside of your list, then they will get an email back saying they can contact you using Earn. From there, if they pay to send the message, you will get the reward once you respond. 

For me this is an excellent resource to keep spammers out of my inbox. When a spammer does want to connect I am now rewarded for giving them a piece of my attention. It suddenly makes checking their messages so much easier!

#### Converting Earnings to Steem

If you're like me then you may want to convert this new BTC into some more Steem for use on the Steemit network. Well that is extremely simple using Blocktrades.us and Earn.com. 

The first thing you'll need to do is open Blocktrades.us and adjust that you want to deposit BTC and that you want to receive Steem. Once you've done that click "Get a new Deposit Address." From here you'll want to copy the BTC address that Blocktrades presents.

Now go back and log into Earn.com and click on your balance in the upper right hand corner of the main signed in page. 

![earn.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1520019211/aqprwpzrwghjhcwxj2zp.png)

From here you'll want to paste your Blocktrades.us deposit address in the Earn withdrawal address. You can then adjust how much you'd like to withdraw but once ready simply hit Next.

![earnwith.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1520019286/ie71qxzjjspmfthttydg.png)

A confirmation will pop up asking you to confirm your withdraw address and amount. After ensuring it matches what you'd like to send hit Next. On the next pop up it's going to again confirm your Blocktrades.us address is correct and then hit bot checkboxes that you realize withdraw times can take up to a day and that Earn cannot recover lost funds. Finally hit next again.

Your BTC from Earn is now on it's way to Blocktrades to be converted to Steem for you. This can take a while and depends on how fast miner's pickup the transaction and confirm it. 

![earnwithpay.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1520019550/yj78y1qzs4ysuccbh9cr.png)

If you kept your Blocktrades.us tab open it may still show that nothing is pending or completed for a bit even after you sent the funds from Earn. This is fairly normal but should eventually move on to a pending or confirmed state.

So I hope this helps each of you earn a few more dollars each month using [Earn.com](earn.com/patrickulrich/referral/?a=v4nfo4z647k1psw1) and hopefully you'll be able to turn that into more SP to begin earning even more rewards using your  [smartsteem](https://smartsteem.com?r=patrickulrich) account.
