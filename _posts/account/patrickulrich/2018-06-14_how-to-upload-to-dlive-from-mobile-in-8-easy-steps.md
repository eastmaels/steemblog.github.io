# Uploading a video to DLive

I had a friend ask me about how he could upload a video to @dlive so I promised him I'd make a little guide. After I thought about it I figured the best way to do it would be to share on Steem so even more people might be able to take advantage. If you notice any errors or have any questions please let me know in the comments below!

#### Step 1 - Open www.dlive.io from you mobile's browser

#### Step 2 - Hit the hamburger menu in the upper right corner

If you find that you are not signed into DLive you'll want to go ahead and do that. Just hit 'Sign in' and use your Active Key to sign in via SteemConnect. If you are already signed in just jump to step 3.

#### Step 3 - Under the hamburger menu drop down select 'Upload Video'

#### Step 4 - Click the upload button

Note: Your file can not be over 4GB in size and must be in .mp4 format. If you're video is larger or is not that format you should be able to find a file converter in your phone's store.

#### Step 5 - Ensure you use your phone's file system

This may or may not be a popup you come into contact with. If your device has multiple file exploreres then you are free to use your preferred explorer. Just locate the file you want to use and select it from the file system. In this example you wouldn't want to use the 'Camcorder' because we'll be uploading a file that has already been recorded.

#### Step 6 - Set your thumbnail

This will be very similar to steps 4 & 5. You'll want to click the 'Upload' button but now you'll be searching for your thumbnail picture to your video. Note: @dlive will work with JPG, PNG or GIF files on this part but you are limited to only a 2MB file. Again if you're file is too big or not one of the supported file types then check your phone's Store to locate an app that can convert for you.

#### Step 7 - Update your video information

In this step you'll make sure your posting information is set how you want it. You will need to provide a title, video description, video category, video language and the tags that are associated with it. This information is what others will see when they try to find your video so being more descriptive is definitely useful!

#### Step 8 - Confirm your settings
Before we hit the 'Submit' button we'll want to review that we have everything where we want it. It is definitely possible to edit after a video is submitted but will require changing in multiple locations if you want to update your Steem post and DLive video so it's definitely nice to be set before hitting submit. The other thing to look for is that the upload bar at the top of the page has completed and that your video is done uploading to the server. If it hasn't finished by this point then just give it some more time and it should upload shortly. Once you're ready to go just hit the purple 'Submit' at the bottom of the page.

#### That's it
You've just posted your video to DLive and documented it on the Steem blockchain! You should now be able to see the video on your Steem page and be able to watch it immediately.
