# There's Still 5 Days of Voting Left!

![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmY75tDb6ASYDpaPMRyiMBmubDkSrFpxC9UJERYDNL2zFR/image.png)

So that mean's you have 5 votes left to give for STEEM. Each user is allowed to vote once every 24 hours so be sure to get as many votes as you can in for STEEM. If we are the top voted coin then they will be listing STEEM on their platform. This means that you'll be able to buy and sell your STEEM at 171,000 different retail locations! It would also ensure we have additional options for supply available.

In case you missed my post from yesterday, I've attached the directions for it below. You can also find them on the original entry from [yesterday](https://steempeak.com/steem/@patrickulrich/vzkjmtv-how-you-can-help-steem-be-sold-in-171-000-retail-locations).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

<div><h1>How You Can Help STEEM Be Listed</h1></div>

1.) Go to [http://contest.gonetcoins.com](http://contest.gonetcoins.com)

2.) Near the bottom of the page you'll see different coins listed. If STEEM isn't listed on the first page then use the search box that I've highlighted in yellow to search for STEEM. Once you locate Steem you put your email address in the box on the right side and click vote. Confirm your email address is correct then click on "Send Confirmation Email"

3.) You'll receive an email from Go NetCoins asking you to confirm your vote. Simply click the link to confirm and your vote will be added to the list.

4.) Now you can vote once a day until October 20th at 11:59PM EST. This means you can help contribute another 6 votes towards making STEEM the next currency on the NETCOINS exchange.

5.) Now be sure to share these instructions with as many people as you know. At the time of this writing STEEM is currently sitting with 1357 votes while Verge is rocking just over 2k at 2,024 votes. With over 50,000 active daily users and well past a million accounts we have the people needed to get STEEM to 1st place. Now we just need you to share this with enough people to make it happen!

<div><h2>Let's do our best to bring STEEM to NETCOINS!</h2></div>
