I need your help. I'm attempting to make my first upload to D.Tube but keep running into this same stopping spot where it appears it gets stuck and doesn't move forward.

I originally started with a rather large video but I noticed some other posts saying it needed to be smaller than 1gb so I've compressed it down to around 433mb. From there I just clicked the link and started uploading but after the file gets completed it moves to the screenshot above. From here it just sits and never makes any progress. If I try to hit submit at the bottom of the upload page it tells me I need to upload a video. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for getting the video to properly upload?
