Join me while I fool around on some different games from the Playstation 4. I've hardly done any of the challenges for this season of Fortnite so we'll star there and see where the day takes us.

I'll also be doing an giveaway each hour for one @SteemBasicIncome share. The first hour's giveaway will go to the first person to chat in the Vimm stream! Be sure to keep watching to see how you can be the win any of the other hours.

If you want to follow along on another platform I'm also live on DLive, Mixer and Stream.me with more links below.
