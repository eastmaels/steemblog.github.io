21.co is no more.  This isn't the end for one of the best funded bitcoin companies that brought us the [The Bitcoin Computer](https://www.amazon.com/21-INC-21BC1-Bitcoin-Coputer/dp/B014RD021C) though, in fact, it is just the beginning. Now they will be known as Earn.com which better identifies their new objectives of helping users get bitcoin for their time.

This isn't without warning though. 21 took a strong pivot over that past year to move away from their prior hardware goals towards a new software future. After launching a platform that allowed users to create a public profile and get paid to respond to messages, they expanded over the past few months to create a Gmail bounce solution that expands on getting paid for your attention. 

Now it's very clear they plan to move forward with this pivot. This is echoed by the fact their old website will forward your views directly to their newly redesigned website and they have changed all of their legacy social networks to earndotcom.

"The idea behind Earn.com is that weâ€™ve built a positive-sum social network, where every notification is an opportunity to earn money. This is quite different from existing social networks, where notifications are often distracting or even downright negative." 

The new network will be built upon a new ERC20 token that they will begin giving out for user's time. In fact that will be the only way for regular users to gain access to the token directly from Earn. (That being said since they are ERC20 tokens you will be able to exchange them using other exchanges easily.) They will begin by creating 21 million tokens and begin giving them out. As the userbase of Earn.com doubles then the token issuance will be cut in half.

I have to say that I've been a 21.co user from their Bitcoin Computer days and even followed them through to have all my personal gmail messages filtered and bounced using their service. As with a lot of users I will miss the old name but can definitely see the value to their new name. Don't fret if you were also a prior user. All of your usernames and messages will simply be moved the new domain. This reminds me, if you ever need to reach out, feel free to send me a message at https://earn.com/patrickulrich/.
