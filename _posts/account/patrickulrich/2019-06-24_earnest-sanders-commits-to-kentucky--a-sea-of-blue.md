 Earlier today I shared the news that Joshua Jones had committed to join the Kentucky Wildcat's offensive line. This afternoon more good news was released when Michigan native Earnest Sanders committed to UK.

Penn State, West Virginia and Michigan State were among the schools to offer Sanders. This once again shows that UK is bringing in talent that other schools are vying for and the cats are winning!

It's going to be fun watching this young team develop over the next few years. As they mature UK could become a completely different school from years past.
