Welcome to the first installment of my new series I'm calling Crypto Industry News! If you've followed me in the past on Google+ then you know I enjoy posting news related to anything on bitcoin or other digital currencies. I usually post individual stories but since I'm going to start posting more here I think a better layout is to list some of the stories I think are most influential to the sector. I hope you enjoy and feel free to give any recommendations in the comments below!

**Bitcoin Derivatives**

LedgerX has went live! They finished the first week of their soft-launch where they have completed more than 1 million dollars in swaps and options trades. Not bad for a company that was trying to keep a low-key launch!

LedgerX made headlines back in July when they were the first Swap Execution Facility (SEF) and Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) company focused on bitcoin to be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This should allow lots of new money to enter the markets that was sitting on the sidelines before!

**Bitcoin Gold Launches**

As of block# 491407, Bitcoin Gold has completed their snapshot of the blockchain to begin the hardfork from the Bitcoin network. Now anyone who held their own private keys for bitcoin will have the same amount of Bitcoin Gold available to them.

Bitcoin Gold, also known as BGold, is a fork from the traditional bitcoin that implements a new proof of work algorithm called Equihash that aims to make mining more decentralized. Equihash has yet to have ASIC chips developed for it so it is still best mined by using GPUs.

**MIT Issues First Digital Diplomas**

MIT has been an innovator in the bitcoin space for some time now and they've just added another notch to the proverbial belt. As a part of a pilot program, they allowed 111 graduates to receive their diplomas on their phones courtesy of a blockchain network. This not only allows them to share the diploma with potential employers it also creates an immutable proof of their education that can last forever.

MIT originally made headlines in the space back in 2014 when they gave each undergraduate the ability to receive $100 of free bitcoin. At the time they released the program, each student could receive about .29 BTC that would be worth about $1,069 today. While not enough to cover their tuition itself, if they hold on to it maybe it can help pay for their kids education someday...

**Valuable Lessons**

That's it! As a side note I've learned a very valuable lesson on using Steemit that I should have already known. Despite being my first post in this series it's actually the second time I've written this article. That's because the first time after hitting post my connection must have timed out and the post wasn't recoverable. A valuable lesson to make sure to write my posts in another text editor or to at least copy and paste before submitting. You live and learn!
