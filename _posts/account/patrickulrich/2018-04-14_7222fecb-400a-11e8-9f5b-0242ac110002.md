It's our first day game! Sorry I've not been around the last week. I had a few projects I've been working on outside of Steem so I've been away from the community for a bit but back now!

I'm still in AAA and hoping to keep dealing. As always you can join the conversation by leaving a comment or jumping into the @dlivecommunity discord at discord.dlive.community. 

I'm going to try some of the new notification tools from zygibo too. You can find all their tools at https://zygmunt.pro/apps/dcr/

My live stream is at [DLive](https://dlive.io/livestream/patrickulrich/7222fecb-400a-11e8-9f5b-0242ac110002)
