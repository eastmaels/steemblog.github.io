Today has been an extremely exciting day for me. I finally sat down and spent enough time playing with Share2Steem to really get a feel for it. I now think it may be the thing to help red pill all of my normal friends into using a form of the Steem blockchain!

# What is Share2Steem?

It's a new dapp built for the Steem blockchain that lets you bring content from your Twitter, Instagram or YouTube over to your Steem account. This means when you post a new tweet or picture they can show on your Steem profile like native Steem content. I think this could end up being the ultimate tool for new users to begin dipping their toes in the Steem waters while maintaining their traditional social media interfaces.

All you need to do, after linking your accounts, to make a Steem post is use your traditional social media and use the tag #share2steem in the post. With that they will convert your tweets, pics and videos into a Steem post and you don't have to do a thing. If you want to see a couple examples from my attempts earlier check this out:

Twitter - https://steemit.com/share2steem/@patrickulrich/patrickulrich-1540241668237-patrickulrichs-twitter-feed--20181022-225428

Instagram - https://steemit.com/share2steem/@patrickulrich/patrickulrich-1540249777834-patrickulrichs-instagram-update--20181023-010937

## How do I get setup?

1.) Head over to [Share2Steem](https://www.share2steem.com/?ref=patrickulrich) start by hitting 'Let's Go'

2.) You'll want to have a Steem account to link to your traditional social media. If you don't have a Steem account head over to https://signup.steemit.com/ to get one set up. If you do then you'll want to say yes on the next page.

</center>

3.) Now it's time to sign in with your Steem account. You won't be signing in via their website but instead be sent to SteemConnect which protects your personal passwords from being shared with Share2Steem.

4.) Now that you've signed in it's time to link your first social media account. This process is fairly straight forward. You'll just want to click the social media account that you want to verify then click 'Next Step'.

5.) For this example I chose Twitter but you may want to do a different one. Regardless the steps are fairly the same and if you follow the instructions you shouldn't have any problems. That being said to verify you'll just insert your Twitter handle on the screen if you selected that platform.

6.) Now that you've identified your Twitter handle you'll just need to follow the instructions to add their special code to your Twitter bio. Each bio code should be different but once you've updated your profile with the code just 'Verify Account'.

7.) Now you're ready to go. Whenever you want a tweet (or IG/YT) to be included to Steem just included #share2steem in the body of the post. That will let Share2Steem know your intentions and carry it over.

## How do I use it?

It is very simple once you're set up your social profiles. Whenever you make a post on Instagram, Twitter or YouTube just include the #share2steem in the body of your post. That's it! They will take care of the rest and make the Steem post for you from there.

#### How can I customize the Steem post's title?

There's a couple ways I can answer that. The first is by including a prebuilt title in the body of your post using brackets [] around it. Whatever you include in the middle of these will become your Steem post's title.

You can also log into [Share2Steem.com](https://www.share2steem.com/?ref=patrickulrich) and go to Medias > The Network You Want to Update > Your Profile and from there be able to set a custom title for when you don't include brackets on a post. By default it includes your name, social network used and the date of the post but you can customize this in a number of ways!

#### How can I include custom tags for my Steem post?

All you have to do to tag your post is include what tags you want as additional hashtags. The first hashtag of the post will become your post's main category and then you can include up to four more along with your #share2steem tag. 

## Is Share2Steem safe to use?

This was one of the first questions I had about the service in the comments of my first posts on their service. I personally think it's very safe. They use SteemConnect to manage your keys so you never actually have to worry about them having control of your funds. Additionally when you verify the account you don't give them access to your social media. Instead you just add a special code to your bios and they use that to verify your Twitter identity. This means you don't need to worry about them taking over any of your social profiles.

## Do they take a beneficiary?

They do take a 10% beneficiary to help support their costs. This puts them on par with DTube but cheaper than Steepshot and Zappl.

## How does the referral process work?

Coming off the question about the beneficiary this is an excellent topic. They actually will split their beneficiary rewards with you if you sign people up for the service. That means if you refer someone they will only take 6% and let you retain 4% for you referral's posts. This means you can now earn by getting your friends to try out Steem!

## Can I customize my post style?

You sure can! After you link your account you can log in to Steem2Share and go to the medias tab followed by the social site you wish to update. Once you're there you can update the way it makes a title or body for your Steem post.

## Future Updates

Shortly after using it for the first time one of the people behind it, @algo.coder, dropped by post and gave some details. He told me they are still working to perfect the conversion of posts but are also looking to add new social sites to be able to pull data from. He mentioned the following sites as possible future updates:

Twitch
WordPress
Tumblr
Facebook

I certainly hope they are able to continue their success from this early release. As I said before this platform could be a huge way to help new users begin to adopt Steem in their everyday lives.
