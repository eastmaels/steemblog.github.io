The Cincinnati Reds have announced this morning that they have fired their manager Bryan Price as well as their pitching coach Mack Jenkins. This comes off one of the Reds worst starts in memory as they currently sit at 3-15 after a loss to the Milwaukee Brewers last night.

In the interim the Reds' bench coach, Jim Riggleman, will step in to fill the shoes of manager. Louisville Bats, the Reds AAA affiliate, manager Pat Kelly and Pensacola (AA) pitching coach Danny Darwin will join the big league staff as interim pitching coach. The club will begin the search for a permanent replacement later in the year.

President of baseball operations and general manager Dick Williams released the following statement Thursday:

> "At this time, we felt a change needed to happen in order to begin the process of getting this team back on the right track. We realize it is early in the season but feel it is important to be proactive. In addition to these staff changes, we will continue to examine all aspects of Baseball Operations to ensure we are doing everything we can to improve."

While the club's expectations were not high for this season they certainly weren't prepared for what they got with Price. After releasing Dusty Baker in 2013, Price took over the helm of the big league Reds with a load of hope for a turn around. Instead the club finished in last place every year from 2015-17, and went 279-387 (.419) under Price overall. Not quite up to expectations.
