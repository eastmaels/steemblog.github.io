# [Update] - This project will no longer be supported. Do NOT send funds to @patrickulrichsc anymore. All attention will be focused towards @dliveupvote. You can learn more on that project by following https://steemit.com/dlive/@dliveupvote/are-you-ready-to-join-the-fun

## This post will remain for historical purposes.

~~I've created an instance of [community bot](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@yabapmatt/community-bot-a-voting-bot-for-steem-communities) that was developed by @yabapmatt. If you send .002 Steem to @patrickulrichsc then it will subscribe you for one month of upvotes from that user. Do not send any funds to my personal account (the one that's writing this, patrickulrich) as it doesn't have anything set up on it.~~

~~Since this is just for testing it may not stay online forever. I will be refunding your orders shortly after you place them and will not be guaranteeing any services through this bot. This is just to test how it works. While I'll be doing refunds I don't know how quick I'll get your payment back so please forgive me if you send over a bit and it takes me a couple days to send it back to you.~~

##### ~~Essentially you'll get upvotes from a minnow for a few days just for taking the time to send over a .002 STEEM. I'll be refunding all payments so please don't hesitate to give this a try. Once I'm shutting it down I will edit this post to notate I'm no longer accepting new entries.~~

## How To Get Set Up
<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmT6uj62SvAkHmwauaFvE1XDUgYMTCSoxoaAuCqRvXEnga/image.png)</center>

~~1.) Send 0.002 STEEM to @patrickulrichsc~~
~~2.) Post content and it will be upvoted~~

Thank you for helping me test! I'm hoping to learn a lot about this bot but need a lot of subscribers to see how it really functions.
