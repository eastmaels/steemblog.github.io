Tonight our band of simlucastors followed my lead as we discussed some topics like SteemConnect 3, DStor, Partiko, Onboarding API from Oracle D and the introduction of DTase. We even got a pretty sweet first drink mix from @shawnsporter. Stop by and let me know what you thought!





@thesteemingpile is an open space live broadcasting project for the Steem & @vimm community. We set up the theme and create the agenda live on air. We are just getting started so feel free to jump on the pile.





We usually livestream each episode starting at 9:30pm EST on Tuesday nights using the vimm.tv network. You can find my channel on vimm at vimm.tv/@patrickulrich.
