**Overstock’s tZERO is Launching an Initial Coin Offering Next Month**

Patrick Byrne, the outspoken leader of Overstock, announced at the Money 20/20 conference that a subsidy of his company that goes by T0 will be launching an ICO next month. 

Byrne went on to say that this sale would run from November 15 until December 31. He also announced the sale will be administered as a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) project. This allows accredited investors to participate bringing the potential for a very large funding potential. Filecoin went through the same process and raised $200 million earlier this year. Byrne has stated, “From what I am hearing, we are going to raise a fortune – $200-$500m easily.”

Last month T0 made an announcement they would be working with the Argon Group and RenGen in order to launch an Alternative Trading System. It appears that the T0 coin will be used as a mechanism similar to Ethereum’s gas.

**Bitcoin to Top Apple Market Cap?**

CNBC recently had Ronnie Moas, the founder and director of Standpoint Research, on Capital Connection. There he stated that "People need to start taking this seriously because today bitcoin caught up with Goldman Sachs, Within five years, it's going to catch Apple which has (a more than) $800 billion market cap."

Speaking like someone who actually understands Bitcoin, Moas went on to say that "You have a supply-demand equation here that is mind-boggling to me." He continued to say that "If 1% of that $200 trillion (combined global markets of gold, stocks, bonds and cash) finds its way into cryptocurrency in the next 10 years, you will be looking at a $2 trillion valuation, 12x what it is today, and that will drive bitcoin price above $50,000."

This isn’t the first time that Moas has been bullish on bitcoin. He correctly called that Bitcoin would rise to $5,000 within a few months back in June.

**BitGive Foundation Goes Live with GiveTrack**

Connie Gallippi, the founder of BitGive, has announced at the Money 20/20 conference they have launched GiveTrack. GiveTrack is a platform that will allow registered non-profits to have users contribute bitcoin and track those donations movements in real time. 

"What we have built is really just a way to make it easier for charities and donors to interact with Bitcoin," said Gallippi. "We are not doing anything fancy or new with the tech; we are simply making it usable for donors to contribute and then to watch the money move."
