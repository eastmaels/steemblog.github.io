I've decided to make what many would consider a completely irrational decision and I'm going to make an 11 hour trip to New York City solely off crypto. To make it even more challenging I will also only be spending funds that I earn on Steem to pay for everything.

# You Heard That Right! Not Only Will It Be Crypto Only But Also Steem Funded Only

This idea was placed in my head when @wa7 announced that @dlive would be holding the first [DLive Meetup in NYC on May 18th 2018](https://steemit.com/dlive/@wa7/dlive-first-official-meetup-may-18th-2018-in-nyc). That's when the ball started rolling in my head of how I could possibly make the trip. I found that time wouldn't be a problem but planning the expenses of a trip like this so quickly could be more of an issue. That's when I decided I would try to make the trip off of Steem earnings alone.

## History
I remember in the early days of Bitcoin there were always articles written about how someone tried living off Bitcoin for a week or tried to travel to some place only using Bitcoin. I always found these extremely interesting just off the fact that it showed this new technology was usable and was allowing actual people the opportunity to make use of the currency regularly. 

I feel this is an extremely powerful narrative. It reinforces that not only can these currencies be actually used but also helps break a lot of the cognitive dissonance that the media has laid out about cryptocurrencies in general. I want to now adjust this narrative a bit to adding the caveat that I will only be spending BTC that I've earned through the Steem platform. It's my hope that this will now allow others to see that not only can you earn a few pennies for your blog post you can even make amazing things like a trip to NY happen.

## My Rules
<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQiY8MGcKiKnV5S9KkEA85BnkfrY5oRC9iB26GTS5cBsy/image.png)</center>
This is going to be a fairly simple gig. I'm going to start with $100 worth of BTC when I leave Lexington, KY on my journey and will be forced to earn anything I spend extra directly from Steem. This means I won't be taking any fiat or even credit cards (I will still be using my BitPay card for any expenses that won't allow me to spend BTC directly.) If I run out of money then I will just need to make a new post and hope one of you gracious Steemians help me out with some upvotes.

Now to ensure I'm not waiting for a week in NYC for my posts to reach their curation reward I am going to spend Steem before it's actually issued to me. The way I will do this is after posting a post if it earns $5 then I will just spend $5 worth of Steem/BTC that I am already holding. Anything that happens to a post after I "cash out" will be considered a wash out. I will also give myself the benefit of using this post as extra funds for the trip.

There's also one additional benefit that I'm allowing myself for this trip that some others may not have access to. That is my earnings from my delegation to @dlivepromoter. Since I have delegated so much SP to this bot I get a daily payout of anywhere from 1 to 3 Steem. Since this is from funds I've placed on Steem and is coming from the overall community I'm allowing these funds to give me at least a guaranteed source of money (even if it is less than $10 a day) that I can have available for making it home. While it gives me something stable I will still be primarily relying on the graciousness of your votes to make it back.

## Join Me!
I hope I can encourage you to join me for this trip! I am very much looking forward to meeting everyone from @dlive on May 18th but would love to meet even more people along the way! Do you live in Ohio, Pennsylvania or near NYC? I would love to take the time to sit down and have a coffee with you to learn more about your story. If you'd be interested please shoot me a message or leave a comment and maybe we can arrange a stop on my trip for a bit.

While I hope to meet many of you along the way I'm also hoping that if you can't be there physically that you will join me through Steemit. I'm going to try to document and share this entire journey here and hope you will be an active part of it. This means you will see lots of Steepshot posts and even short DLive streams, when my internet connection is strong enough to support it, of the trip. Please take the time to give me local suggestions and encouragement. I will definitely need it :) 

You'll be able to follow all of these adventures directly from my Steemit page at https://steemit.com/@patrickulrich.

## Final Thoughts
With my final thoughts I'll end this with all of the gratitude I have for everyone on this platform. You each join me here daily with kind words and encouragement so I can never tell you how much it means. I'm attempting a dream every day and it's all because of each of you!
