"What's Ahead for Bitcoin?" will be a panel discussion held at the University of Kentucky's Gatton College tonight at 5:30pm EST. The panel will consist of 3 panelists including an internationally renowned expert on cryptocurrencies, Dr. Will Luther of the [Sound Money Project](http://soundmoneyproject.org/).

Luther, along with a panel of Gatton College faculty members, including Shane Hadden of [The Currency Report](https://www.globalcurrencyreport.com), will discuss what it means to mine bitcoin, whether or not itâ€™s a worthwhile investment, and the future role of digital currencies.

While I'm excited to be able to attend this event, I'm even more excited to share that the Schnatter Institute for the Study of Free Enterprise has agreed to allow my company, @bluegrassbitcoin, to broadcast this event to Steemit using DLive! Please go ahead and follow @bluegrassbitcoin so you'll see when our live feed comes online.
