The Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group, the largest derivatives exchange in the world, has announced that they plan to launch a bitcoin futures market before the end of the year.

Before they will be able to go live with the offering they will need approval from regulators but CME seems confident that won't be a problem. While speaking to CNBC's Closing Bell Terry Duffy, CME Group's CEO, stated that, "We've been working with the regulator. They understand our application. And they understand our model very, very well."

CME Group will continue their partnership with Crypto Facilities Ltd. to use their published Bitcoin Reference Rate. BRR aggregates the trade flow of major bitcoin exchanges against the USD price daily as of 4pm GMT. The exchanges that make up the prcing for the BRR are Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken.

This isn't the first company to offer derivatives for the bitcoin market. Earlier this year LedgerX became the first regulated platform for Bitcoin futures and has done [quite well](https://steemit.com/crypto-news/@patrickulrich/bitcoin-derivatives-bgold-mit-digital-diplomas-crypto-industry-news-10-23-17). Needless to say CME looks to get in on some of that action and certainly has the size to dwarf most other competitors.
