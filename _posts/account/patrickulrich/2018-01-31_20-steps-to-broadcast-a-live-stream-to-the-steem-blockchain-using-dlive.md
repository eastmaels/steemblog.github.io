Did you know Steem is the backbone to a lot more than just Steemit? You can share photos with Steepshot (just like Instagram), add videos for others to watch using DTube (just like YouTube) or even go live with a broadcast like you would on Periscope or Facebook Live.

Last night, while I was testing out my PS4 stream on my new [secondary account](https://steemit.com/@patulrich), @markop mentioned having some issues with setting up a stream. I had promised I'd put a guide from how I put mine together and here it is! To get started we will have to download the Open Broadcaster Software known as OBS. It is what controls your feed for being live. So let's get started...

1.) Downlaod OBS
- You can find the software for OBS at https://obsproject.com

2.) Install OBS

3.) Visit DLive.com and sign in using SteemConnect 

4.) Hit ‘Go Live’ in upper right corner

5.) Start by clicking ‘Upload thumbnail’ This will create the header image for your Steemit post as well as what shows up on the thumbnail for DLive.

6.) Give you video a title and description based on what your stream will be about
- If applicable enable the ‘Enable age restriction’ if your video is going to have any adult content

7.) Use the drop down to add a category for your video

8.) Add any tags you’d like to join in for the video

9.) Apply your video's primary language

10.) Open OBS

11.) Hit ‘Settings’ in the lower right hand corner
<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcpRQ1UciEd1uYreAGxvUiWSvorR65zYWbW7M96UZNVNK/image.png)</center>

12.) Click the ‘Stream’ tab on the pop up menu
<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmc7NL8Xpx9hjs2Qq53thaujART3yEiX5pkV4j1g4hGFtm/image.png)</center>

13.) Change the top dropdown for Stream Type to ‘Custom Streaming Server’
<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRjMay5YpFftJKasiRXW8LkfVRbXS4kv9dm5CgyA42DJp/image.png)</center>

14.) Pulling from the lower right hand corner of the DLive page, that we were inputting your stream title, description, tags, etc on, insert the URL, Stream Key, Select ‘Use Authentication’, username and password into OBS.

15.) Hit ‘Apply’ in lower right hand corner of OBS and then ‘Ok’

16.) Edit how you like your Steemit post to appear and then hit ‘Post’. (Note: It will prepopulate using your title and description given in step 6.)

17.) Hit 'Start' to begin the connection.
- After hitting start you will have to wait for a few moments. It will then pop up a reminder to start OBS.

18.) Go back into OBS to make sure your feed is set up the way you want.
<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcpRQ1UciEd1uYreAGxvUiWSvorR65zYWbW7M96UZNVNK/image.png)</center>
- To add a video feed hit the '+' under sources and chose what you want to broadcast.
-- Display Capture - shows a feed of what your display shows
-- Image - Displays a still image file
-- Video Capture Device - This would be where you would add you webcam or other video feed

19.) Hit 'Start Streaming'
- If it pops up an error saying it cannot connect then wait a few moments and try again. DLive may have not activated their side of the server yet.

20.) Your live! Enjoy your broadcast and try to monitor the comments. It's useful if you can keep the feed up so you can interact with your followers.

After your broadcast is over you can hit 'End' on the DLive page. From there it will inform you that a broadcast will be available in your profile within the next 24 hours. From there you can save your video to retain or to upload back onto DLive or DTube. There's no longer a reason to give your broadcasts to Facebook again!

If you have any questions let me know in the comments. I'll be happy to help answer as many questions as I can!
