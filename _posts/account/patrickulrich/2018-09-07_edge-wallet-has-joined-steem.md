# Edge Wallet Has Joined Steem

I am very happy to announce that I just signed Edge Wallet up to use the Steem blockchain for posting their video content to @dlive! Earlier today I seen them tweet out that they were preparing to go live on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube for some updates on how they will be handling their wallet with Shapeshift's announcement of KYC.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Catch <a href="https://twitter.com/paullinator?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@paullinator</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/s_tec?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@s_tec</a> LIVE in 30 min for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/twitterlive?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#twitterlive</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/facebooklive?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#facebooklive</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/youtubelive?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#youtubelive</a> we will be talking about how <a href="https://twitter.com/EdgeWallet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EdgeWallet</a> is affected by the <a href="https://twitter.com/ShapeShift_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ShapeShift_io</a> updates to memberships and so much more....... <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#bitcoin</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/crypto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#crypto</a> <a href="https://t.co/1bi8hXpeoE">pic.twitter.com/1bi8hXpeoE</a></p>&mdash; Edge (@EdgeWallet) <a href="https://twitter.com/EdgeWallet/status/1038134901743075330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

With that I had to seize the opportunity to see if they would do the same for @dlive! I immediately tweeted back to test the waters...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What about going live on <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialDLive?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OfficialDLive</a>?</p>&mdash; Patrick Ulrich (@patrick_ulrich) <a href="https://twitter.com/patrick_ulrich/status/1038136968566243339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

I can't say I fully expected a response back but when I got one I was ecstatic!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We will next week!! <a href="https://t.co/xVIkoEGBlv">pic.twitter.com/xVIkoEGBlv</a></p>&mdash; Edge (@EdgeWallet) <a href="https://twitter.com/EdgeWallet/status/1038143741507166208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

## Please follow them now! @edgewallet

Not one to wait around I immediately created a new account for them that tied in with their existing social media accounts and began the conversation. Shortly after that I was getting a response from the Controller of @edgewallet, [PayneFullHuman](https://twitter.com/PayneFullHuman), saying to go ahead and upload some content and asking me to send the new account's keys over!

## Secret Mission, Shh! Don't Tell!!!
I'm not going to lie that I have a secret mission with getting @edgewallet to try out DLive. My hope is that they will see how easy it is for individuals to make an income from Steem and possibly begin supporting it in their multi-asset cryptocurrency wallet. This wallet has been downloaded over 50k times on Android plus is available on iOS!

Imagine the exposure we could get from having one of the best wallets in the industry support STEEM! Even better is if they would begin support account creation from inside the wallet. What if someone logged into the Edge Wallet for the first time to be greeted with a message that they now support a currency that allows people to share on an uncensorable network and even earn some rewards while doing it? That would be some excellent tie-ins! 

## Try it out!

If you've never tried out Edge then I would recommend heading over to [edge.app](https://edge.app/) and giving it a spin. It makes utilizing crypto a breeze and supports a wide range of currencies like BTC, ETH, LTC, XMR, XRP, BCH, DASH, REP and many more! Plus it utilizes a cool technology they introduced with their Airbitz wallet that's now called Edge Login. Edge Login allows you to create a much more memorable sign in with a basic username and password as opposed to keeping up with your private keys. It really helps newbies get started in crypto!

Speaking of newbies it will even allow you to buy crypto from within the wallet. This means that if you need to buy Steem you can get some BTC directly from Edge and then send it to @blocktrades to be converted to Steem! How easy is that!
