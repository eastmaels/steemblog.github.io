### Terms & Escrow

After the bidding has ended or a 'Buy It Now' is placed then the winning bidder will be responsible for buying the Steem Monster token at their respective bid. Payment will be expected to be made within 48 hours of the auction end. If the winning bidder is not a Steem Monsters Merchant then you will have the option of sending the SBD first and waiting for me to send the Steem Monster after payment is confirmed.

Alternatively, I will also use a Steem Monster Merchant as an escrow service allowing us to each send our side to them and have them return it to the proper owners. Steem Monster Merchants issue a performance bond to @aggroed that ensures if they do not perform their duties the bond can make us whole. You can learn more about the way Merchant Performance Bonds work by [reading here](https://steemit.com/steemmonsters/@steemmonsters/trading-in-steem-monsters-is-now-live). Most merchants offer this as a free service but accept donations for their services.
