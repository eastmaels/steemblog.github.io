I'm thankful that I seen @rival's auction which inspired me to to do this one.  If you haven't heard of Steem Monsters yet then be sure to check out @aggroed's [introductory post](https://steemit.com/steemmonsters/@aggroed/steem-monsters-alpha-release-a-collectible-trading-card-game-with-rpg-elements-comes-alive-on-the-steem-blockchain) for more information on the game. I personally think this could be a huge game for the ecosystem.
