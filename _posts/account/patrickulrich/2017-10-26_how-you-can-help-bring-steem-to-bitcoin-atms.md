Greetings everyone! As you may have read in my [introduction post](https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@patrickulrich/hi-steemit-i-m-patrick), I operate a couple Bitcoin ATMs in my area. I started doing the machines to help others in my region have an easier access to jump into Bitcoin. That being said I think people need a direct way into another currency, Steem!

That’s why I’m hoping this post finds someone with an advanced knowledge of integrating Steem into new products. The machines I, and at least [438 locations](https://coinatmradar.com/manufacturers/), use are made by [General Bytes](https://www.generalbytes.com/). 

What’s great about GB is that they’ve put lots of work into expanding the functionality of their platform. They now have support for a wide range of crypto, like LTC, Ethereum, Dash and others but Steem is surprisingly still missing. They also offer new updates for both security and functionality at least once a month so I think they will be around for some time!

Another part of their platform that I find interesting is that they’ve released an [open source extension](https://github.com/GENERALBYTESCOM/batm_public) for developers to integrate other cryptocurrencies onto their platform. This is where you hopefully come in! If you would be interested in helping bring this functionality to the 440 machines that are already listed on CoinATMRadar plus a potential new [set of owners](https://twitter.com/generalbytes/status/921485109999566848) then we would love to have your help!

I definitely appreciate you taking the time to read this post and hope that if you have the skills to make this integration happen that you take a look and see if it would be possible. I personally feel that adding a new way for new users to be on-boarded, with such an ease of use, could do wonders for Steem in the long run. If you’re like me and don’t have the skill set to make this happen, please share this article with anyone that may or if someone is already on the ball please share their project in the comments below. The more eyes on the problem the better!
