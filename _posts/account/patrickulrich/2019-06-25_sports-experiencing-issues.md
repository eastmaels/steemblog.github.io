I want to update everyone that an issue has been found within the SPORTS SCOT. It seems there was an early distribution of tokens that was not supposed to occur. This has been reported to the Steem Engine team and they are looking into the situation.

In the mean time I recommend that no one place any market orders for SPORTS. I don't know what has caused these issues or what will need to be done to resolve this situation so until more is known I recommend avoiding the market entirely.

I will report more details as soon as I hear them.
