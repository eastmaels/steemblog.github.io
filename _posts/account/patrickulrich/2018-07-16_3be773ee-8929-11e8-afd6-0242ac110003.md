I seen @mrviquez do a livestream earlier to assist people with their Byteball airdrop and thought it was a great idea. Now I want to play a little Fortnite and I thought what better way to do it than helping people during rounds!

## What is Byteball?
Byteball is another digital currency that is built to help do ICOs. They offer an innovative way to ensure anyone offering an ICO is only accepting accredited investors.

## How is it going to help me earn more Steem Power?
Byteball decided to offer a free airdrop to anyone with a Steem account at a certain rep. This means you will receive free Byteball that you can convert into Steem and then power up for a larger vote!

## How much SP will I get?
This depends on your Steem REP and how much you'll be able to sell them for on the exchange. This is what Byteball will distribute:

Steem reputation 30 and above: you get a $10 reward
Steem reputation 40 and above: you get a $20 reward
Steem reputation 50 and above: you get a $40 reward
Steem reputation 60 and above: you get a $80 reward
Steem reputation 70 and above: you get a $160 reward

You only get half available today but you'll get the other half one year from today after it's released in a smart contract.

## How do I redeem my airdrop Byteball?
Follow these steps in order:
1.) Download the Byteball Wallet [here](https://steem-byteball.org/#4GSS2XFPD4VX6IUNSOPSDD46TH7MXWF7)

2.) You'll need a few bytes to send as a payment to link your address to your Steem account. Send me a message on Discord (@patrickulrich) and I'll forward you enough to cover the payment. (You can find me in the @dlivecommunity, @dlive or @fundition Discords if we aren't connected.)

3.) Once you've received your Bytes then click on the chat section in the lower right followed by 'bot store' in the upper portion. Then look for the 'Steem attestation bot' to get started on connecting your Steem account to Byteball.

4.) Now it's going to ask you to enter the address of the wallet you want to attest. Click the icon at the bottom left  and choose “Insert my address” and press the send button  to send it to the bot.

5.) The bot will now generate a link for you to verify you account via SteemConnect. Follow that and sign in with your Steem credentials.

6.) It will ask if you want to do a public or private registration. Public allows anyone to search by your Steem username to send you bytes to this address in the future. I chose public.

7.) Now you will send your payment for the attestation by clicking the 'Payment request: 49000 bytes link.' This is why you needed to wait to have me send some bytes to make the payment.

8.) As soon as that payment is processed the bot will send you your airdrop funds.

## How do I turn my Bytes in Steem Power?
I'm converting my bytes using Bittrex. Once you sell them on the exchange you can just send them to your Steem wallet and then power up to increase your Steem Power.

It was that easy! Now let's go find a llama together.
