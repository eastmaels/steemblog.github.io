DLie continues to show their class. After speaking out against their moves over the past week I just received two @ginabot notifications that they have went ahead and removed their votes from my content. I guess I was good enough for them when I was supporting them but not so much when I'm speaking out.

I hope any of you that are thinking of continuing on with this class act of an organization read this and see who you are getting in bed with. I've been trying to warn you that these aren't people that are to be trusted the last few days. Hopefully seeing this will only emphasize that fact now.

Good riddance @dlive!
