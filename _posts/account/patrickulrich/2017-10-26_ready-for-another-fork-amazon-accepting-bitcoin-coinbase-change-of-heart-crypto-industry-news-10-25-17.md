I'm barely making it in before the day comes to a close but here are some of the stories I seen today that stood out most to me. 

I found out that we're moving down the value names for a new Bitcoin fork, possibly seeing one of the largest retailers in the world accept Bitcoin for payment and personally been disappointed in Coinbase's stance. I hope you enjoy and please leave a comment below!

**Ready for Another Fork?: Bitcoin Silver Is On The Way!**

Bitcointalk user Simonsolo dropped a new potential fork to the world yesterday. Yes you heard that right another new fork of bitcoin. 

The similarities to Bitcoin Gold don’t end with just the naming either. The Bitcointalk post lists 4 main bullet points such as decentralization, fair distribution, replay protection and transparency all the same as what are listed on Bitcoin Gold’s website. It goes even deeper, they will also share the same proof of work algorithm Equihash which is what’s credited for the decentralization of Satoshi’s vision of “one CPU on vote.”

Who’s with me to do Bitcoin Bronze in January?

**Potential Amazon Bitcoin Announcement?**

Back in September, The James Altucher Report stated that Amazon could make an announcement as early as their next earnings call that the retail giant would begin accepting Bitcoin. This was then picked up by Squawker.org who went on to note that Amazon Web Services had begun working with Digital Currency Group back in 2016.

With the rumor now swirling, it led to an article from Die Welt, a German national newspaper, that stated rumors were running in Silicon Valley that Amazon would soon accept the digital currency. This was further echoed by Cointelegraph today with another article on the topic.

You can already shop on Amazon using Bitcoin with Purse.io but having another company the size of Amazon supporting it natively would definitely give a strong use case for the revolutionary ledger. While on that thought, what an excellent acquisition Purse would actually make for the retail giant. Not only would you be picking up a company that is already saving your customers 20% over you own prices, you’d also get some of the brightest minds in the industry.

**Coinbase Reverses Course on Bitcoin Naming**

After issuing a blog entry on Monday stating that they would operate by naming the traditional bitcoin chain Bitcoin and refer to the forked chain as Bitcoin2x. Yesterday they then released a clarification stating they would be calling “the chain with the most accumulated difficulty Bitcoin.”

This immediately brought back the nervousness of the fork for many while others questioned the logic. If Coinbase was going to name the chain with the most most difficulty wouldn’t that mean that Bitcoin Cash should have shared the label of Bitcoin anytime it had surpassed traditional Bitcoin’s difficulty.

Will we see a new clarification issued reversing the reversal? I have to hope so, for Coinbase’s sake.
