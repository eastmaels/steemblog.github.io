I'm going to be working on some websites and scheduling this morning so I figured I'd bring everyone along with me for company! As always I'll be following the news and happy to talk about anything crypto for anyone that has questions.

I'm also making my first attempt at using the new DLive encoder. Hopefully I get this right! Please jump in the chat and let me know if you are having trouble seeing or hearing me.

My live stream is at [DLive](https://dlive.io/livestream/patrickulrich/851dab2c-488d-11e8-b5f5-0242ac110002)

# Today's News
## [Nasdaq CEO says "Would Consider Creating Crypto Exchange"](https://www.coindesk.com/nasdaq-consider-creating-crypto-exchange-says-ceo/)
Adena Friedman has expressed her thoughts that the Nasdaq would consider adding a crypto exchange to their services as the need arose. This could lead to a whole new level of regulated Bitcoin trading.

## [EOS Nears All Time High](https://www.coindesk.com/eos-eyes-new-all-time-high-amid-positive-news-flow/)
EOS is approaching it's all time highs again. Currently trading at $14.85, it is just below it's all time high of $18.67 and may pass it soon.

## [Multiple Exchanges Reportedly Stopping ERC-20 Trading](https://cointelegraph.com/news/multiple-exchanges-suspend-erc20-token-trading-due-to-potential-batchoverflow-bug)
It appears that multiple exchanges have stopped trading in ERC-20 tokens due to a potential smart contract bug. While trading will probably resume after services are ensured to be operating normally it reiterates that crypto platforms are still new and changing.

## [Bitstamp To Sell Exchange To Nexon?](https://www.ccn.com/bitstamp-to-be-sold-to-south-korean-gaming-firm-for-350-million-report/)
It appears that Business Insider is reporting that Bitstamp, one of the oldest Bitcoin exchanges, may be selling itself to Counterstrike creator Nexon for $350 million. This would be huge news in my opinion but also a bad deal for the exchange. I would imagine their value as being much higher than just $350 million with Poloniex selling for $400 million recently.

## [Huobi Lists Steem!](https://steemit.com/huobi/@steemitblog/steem-now-listed-on-huobi)
Huobi exchange has now listed Steem as a trading pair on their site. The social media currency will be listed with pairs for BTC, ETH and USDT. Huobi has even made a promotional offer for Steemit users to get 50% off fees. You can find the offer at the link above.
