If you've never experienced the speed of a lightning transaction then you'll enjoy taking this post for a spin. In it I'm going to show you how you can use [Coinpanic's Lightning Community Jar](https://www.coinpanic.com/Lightning/CommunityJar) to send a mainnet bitcoin payment via the lightning protocol to complete a test transaction in the shopsteem.com store.

Note: This will not be sending any of your personal funds at all. This will be sending funds via Coinpanic's Lightning Community Jar. Please be conscientious while using these resources.

### 1.) Open the [ShopSteem.com Lightning Test Product](http://shopsteem.com/?product=test-product) and add it to the cart.

### 2.) View your cart by hovering over the cart icon or hitting the green highlight.

### 3.) Scroll down and click 'Proceed to checkout ->'

### 4.) Enter fake information for your billing details (DO NOT ENTER REAL LIFE INFORMATION HERE!) then click the radial for Bitcoin followed by 'Proceed to BTCPay'

### 6.) Copy the payment address to your clipboard. (Hitting the lightning icon in the lower left will copy to your clipboard)

### 7.) Open a second window for [Coinpanic's Community Jar](https://www.coinpanic.com/Lightning/CommunityJar) and paste your payment address on the right side under 'Take from Jar'

### 8.) Make sure your have both windows open side by side before clicking 'Pay Invoice'. You'll want to see this!

### 10.) You've just completed your Bitcoin lightning transaction. It wasn't that hard at all now was it?

<br>Depending on how well I stay connected to CoinPanic's tool may mean that at times your transaction will fail. If so leave a comment and I'll be happy to troubleshoot and let you know when you can give it another shot!

Hope you enjoyed it! Please do not attempt to test the Steem functionality at this time. It will not work! Let me repeat that part. Do NOT test the Steem payments part of the site. It will not work! I will let everyone know when you can test that part out and when I'll start adding products to the site.
