This will be my first post on DLive using this account so I welcome everyone to come in and join the conversation! I'm planning to get started around 2:30pm EST.<BR><BR>

Today I was asked by @laurapinne to take a look at her new app, Bitcoin Flip. I've downloaded the app to my Note 5 and will be testing it out for you all.<BR><BR>

Then we will cover a brief run down on smartsteem. Smartsteem is a new platform that allows you to monetize your upvotes and put your SBD to good use. To get started with smartsteem sign up today at https://smartsteem.com?r=patrickulrich<BR><BR>

After we finish those up I'll circle back around and try to answer any questions that you all may have in the chat. Thanks for stopping in!<BR><BR>
