I'm not sure what happened to my computer before but I'm back now!

I've got a ton of tasks to work on today but not a lot of content to get started with. I'll start by reviewing some of the news from the last All In but will mainly be streaming some reactions to various tech (mainly crypto) talks. As always I'm open to discussing anything you want to bring to the table!

I'm also going to test the new @steem-bounty system for comments with a 1 Steem Bounty. The way it works is that any comment on the stream should be eligible for a piece of the bounty as long as they get upvotes from the community. At the end of the stream I'll then upvote one comment based on a random draw using http://pick.esteem.ws/. That comment will get 80% of the bounty while the 20% will go to the comments that the community feels adds the most value. If no one upvotes any comments outside of my random draw then the winner will get 100% of the bounty. My understanding is the bounty will be paid out 7 days from now to give each comment time to be voted on so be sure to join with me!

My live stream is at [DLive](https://dlive.io/livestream/patrickulrich/cb6427c7-4d65-11e8-951a-0242ac110002)

In a patent application that was recently revealed it appears that Mastercard is seeking a patent to speed up the time it takes for new nodes to sync with the blockchain. Essentially the application is set to allow placing a special notation in the header of a block to better set checkpoint for where to restore from.
