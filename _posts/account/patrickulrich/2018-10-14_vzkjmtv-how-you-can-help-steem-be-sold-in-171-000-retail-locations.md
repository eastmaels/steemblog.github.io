Have you ever heard of NETCOINS? They are a Canada based crypto company, that I first heard about on @LastWeekCrypto, which helps their customers easily buy and sell bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. They do this by offering virtual Bitcoin ATM software that allows customers to buy and sell cryptocurrency at 171,000 different retail locations. Now they are offering one lucky crypto the opportunity to be listed on their platform for FREE. If we as Steemians can be the top vote grabbers then that means you'll be able to buy and sell STEEM at those same 171,000 locations in over 53Â countries and across 6 continents.

<div><h1>How You Can Help STEEM Be Listed</h1></div>

1.) Go to [http://contest.gonetcoins.com](http://contest.gonetcoins.com)

2.) Near the bottom of the page you'll see different coins listed. If STEEM isn't listed on the first page then use the search box that I've highlighted in yellow to search for STEEM. Once you locate Steem you put your email address in the box on the right side and click vote. Confirm your email address is correct then click on "Send Confirmation Email"

3.) You'll receive an email from Go NetCoins asking you to confirm your vote. Simply click the link to confirm and your vote will be added to the list.

4.) Now you can vote once a day until October 20th at 11:59PM EST. This means you can help contribute another 6 votes towards making STEEM the next currency on the NETCOINS exchange.

5.) Now be sure to share these instructions with as many people as you know. At the time of this writing STEEM is currently sitting at 65 votes while DigitalFantasySports is rocking ahead at over 1,000 votes. With over 50,000 active daily users and well past a million accounts we have the people needed to get STEEM to 1st place. Now we just need you to share this with enough people to make it happen!

<div><h2>Let's do our best to bring STEEM to NETCOINS!</h2></div><center><img alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/oracle-d/image/upload/v1539528202/nnia8e4d0mm1qrqeqcht.png" ></center>
