I grabbed this shot outside of my office in Lexington of an orange Spin bike. I've been seeing them everywhere and decided to do some digging.  I've come to find it's a new platform where you rent a bike for 30 minutes for only a $1.

I find this model extremely intriguing and can't wait to try them out! Once you download the app you just find an available bike and scan its QR to get started. Each bike is solar powered and equipped with GPS and a locking mechanism. This means they are dockless so once you're done using it simply leave it on the side walk and go on with your day.
