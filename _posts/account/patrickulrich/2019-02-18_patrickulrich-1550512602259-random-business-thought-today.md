I was once told that a business is a lot like a ball room dance. It's essentially two units who are working together to create a synergistic flow between the two of them that is predictable and constructive. Unfortunately there's times when one partner expects one thing but the other is expecting a different and it ends up causing confusion and sometimes a stubbed toe in the case of dance. Similarly if this happens too much then your partner, or customer, may find a new dancer to work with.

Recently I've been working with a team who's having severe operational issues and I've been brought in to alleviate some of those trouble spots. As I've now spent some time with this organization I've discovered they have a very customer centric attitude that often leads them to "go the extra mile" and do custom jobs. Unfortunately they've created so many custom jobs that there really isn't a lot of standard operating procedures left. This is now leading them to the point where their custom work to make a customer happy is actually causing issues where they are under-performing because work is no longer properly flowing.

Arbitrary numbers can become a huge business loss because they create uncertainty internally and externally. Why business owners don't embrace standard operating procedures is beyond me! #business #share2steem

I don't believe that customer satisfaction is something  that can be created in chaos. Instead my belief is that good customer service is created by the same characteristics of predictability and constructiveness that we find in a good dance partner. That's why it bewilders me when business owners are willing to introduce inefficiencies, like custom arbitrary numbers, to alleviate smaller concerns that don't affect core responsibilities and needs of their business.

Instead I find that the better route is to become as robotic as possible with your business procedures. This allows your partner to know where your next move will be flowing and then your partner can make their own internal calls on how to meet you in the middle. This creates the synergy of two units working in harmony to create an overall work that outperforms when one unit is acting unpredictably regardless of their intentions.

What do you think? Let me know in the comments if you prefer working with a business that would often go out of its way for you but could end up with a delayed or incomplete product or one that has defined roles between the two of you but delivers a consistent experience.
