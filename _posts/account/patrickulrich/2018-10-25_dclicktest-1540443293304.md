I just seen the introductory post by @dclick show in my feed and wanted to test their service out a bit to learn more on how it works and what all the platform allows for. I'm not really sure how this will turn out but the concept is amazing and is one of the best use cases I've envisioned for SMTs when they launch early next year. If you've not heard of @dclick you can learn more from their introductory post linked below. 

Essentially they will allow you to create posts that feature an advertisement at the bottom of the page that, when clicked, earns you rewards in the form of DCLICK. These DCLICK tokens will be listed as SMTs once the protocol is released and will be used to allow advertisers to purchase space on blogs. Additionally they will allow you to trade your DCLICKs in for upvotes until the launch of SMTs so you can begin monetizing content on the blockchain.

This is an excellent opportunity for a couple reasons. One is that you will be able to open new revenue streams from the same content you're already creating. It also means you can earn rewards from non-steem users when they click any of the promoted links on your content. This should help any users who need that extra bit more to add to their Steem coffers.

Potentially more important is that this helps your content continue monetization past the 7 day post payouts that normal Steem posts are limited by. That's because even after your post pays out it's reward the link will still be on your content and available to be clicked on by your followers. 

I ran into this issue often when referring people to test out DLive. On sites like YouTube they would be rewarded if someone watched a video even 2 years after it was posted. That's because YouTube still had the ability to show advertisements on a video. On Steem if their followers didn't upvote before payout then they wouldn't get an rewards for creating content. That can all begin to change now!

If you're interested in what I just envisioned don't go to their site expecting the full suite of tools you'll find on Adsense though. It's certainly not at that point yet since it's just a beta test. That being said I can see the value this approach can facilitate and will certainly be watching this project with close attention.
