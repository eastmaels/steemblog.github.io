Hey everyone! I wanted to help test a new video platform built for the Steem ecosystem so I uploaded a video of what @katiulrich and I will be having for dinner tonight. Don't judge me that I couldn't even remember what it is I'm cooking half way through talking about it! :)

What are you all having for dinner tonight?
