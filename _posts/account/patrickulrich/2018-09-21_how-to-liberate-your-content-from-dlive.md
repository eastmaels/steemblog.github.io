Are you upset that @dlive is abandoning the Steem blockchain? Do you want to ensure that your content doesn't get migrated over to the new platform while still retaining a copy of your videos that you worked so hard to create? I'm going to attempt to lay out what I know as being the best options to do just that in this post.

## Downloading Your DLive Video Uploads

This process is only for videos that you've uploaded to DLive. It will most likely not work for anything you've streamed. I will detail that process below.

1.) Use CTRL + Shift + I to go into the Developer Tools of your browser (I'm using Chrome in this example) 
2.) Go to Network and apply the Media filter to sort out the rest of the page elements. If you don't see Network use the >>arrows to see it on the dropdown.

3.) Navigate over to your DLive video's URL and you should see your video populate in the file section.

4.) Right click on your video file and then 'Open in new tab'

5.) Use the menu button in the lower right hand corner of your video to find the 'Download' option. This will begin downloading the video to your computer.

## Download a copy of your DLive streams

This is a bit more complicated. That's because streams aren't saved as single video file like a video upload is. Instead streams are actual a playlist of multiple little videos stitched together to create a stream. To download them you will need to install a bit of extra software to your computer.

1.) Head over to http://jdownloader.org to begin downloading the jDownloader software. Note: Be sure as you are install jdownloader to watch for bundled software. You can also perform this task using VLC but I have not included full instructions for that here.

2.) Open the stream you will want to download and add /edit to the end of it. That will make the URL look like this DLIVESTREAMURL/edit.

3.) Right click on your stream video and select 'Copy video address'

4.) Open jDownloader and click 'Add New Links' at the bottom left.

5.) It will likely auto fill your clipboard into the field but if not paste your video address into the box next to the + with a magnifying glass beside it. Click 'Continue'

5b.) If you don't have the necessary codecs installed you may be prompted to install another package. Follow that process and then repeat the steps to get to this point from there.

6.) You will see your videos playlist listed along with it's availability. Now just hit 'Start all Downloads' in the lower right hand side of the jDownloader program.

7.) Let the download finish running and you should have a copy stored in your Downloads folder after it finishes.

## Delete Your Content From DLive

If you've followed the steps above you should now have a copy of the video safely stored on your computer. This means you can safely remove your content from the grasps of DLive. This will be a very simple process.

1.) Open your DLive stream or video and add edit like we done in a prior step. (eg DLIVEURL/edit)

2.) Scroll to the bottom of the page and you will see three buttons. Simply select 'Delete' and the video should be removed from DLive.
