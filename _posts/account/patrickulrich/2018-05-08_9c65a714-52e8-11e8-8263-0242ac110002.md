Sorry for cutting off the last video. I came back in the office and accidentally closed out of OBS. 

While I was out for lunch with Kati I realized today was the opening Keynote for Google I/O. I'm going to still finish up working on a couple projects I have to complete but will be reacting to Google's announcements as I hear them.
