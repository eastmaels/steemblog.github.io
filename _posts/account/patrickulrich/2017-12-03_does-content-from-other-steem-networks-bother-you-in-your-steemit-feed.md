I love Steem. I love Steemit. I love Steepshot. I love Zappl. I don't love how they all operate together for multiple reasons. The biggest issue I have is that I feel there should be some type of network identifier that would let you filter posts from other Steem networks from showing if you don't want to see that type of content. While I'm sure this will be resolved in the future, right now I don't like how it's set up. 

I don't like this setup so much that I even went as far as to create a 2nd account to just post content using apps like Zappl and Steepshot. Then I started to write a post to introduce the account and realized I would want to always be able to scroll back through what I've shared on these networks and if I ever merge things back together then I doubt I'll be able to ever combine this content.

I did this second account so I wouldn't bother any of my followers if they didn't want to see a lot of short content posts like Zappl or single image shares like what comes from Steepshot. Then it dawned on me that others may not even be bothered by this as much as I am. That's why I'm instead writing this post to check other's thoughts on what they enjoy seeing on Steemit and if lots of new posts from these other networks is a turn off for you.
