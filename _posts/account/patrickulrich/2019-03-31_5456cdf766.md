As you can see in the image above you should be sharing these to the DrugWars' TokenBB Forum for a chance at an upvote reward. I switched over shortly after @drugwars made this change and my first post in the forums did receive an upvote. That being said the rest of the fights I posted there this week have received no votes. Now I'm testing here to see if an upvote arrives on this post instead.

I thought maybe FutureShock were just slowing down on votes until I started seeing others sharing through the Steemit method and receiving @fundition upvotes. If @drugwars have decided to change back to requiring us to spam our feeds could we at least get an announcement or update to the game screen above so I can quit wasting RCs posting in the @tokenbb forums.

How about you all? Have you been trying any Steem posts with luck or have you been getting any votes on the Tokenbb comments it makes?
