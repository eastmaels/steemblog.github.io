# What are CryptoFighters?
<center>![cryptofighters.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVrQ6bDLKuLiShfVZeJzbfPu7LFXv7juvBWmD6Qu4aZBi/cryptofighters.png)</center>
Cryptofighters are Ethereum tokens that are built with characteristics of trading cards like Magic: The Gathering or Pokemon. You can begin by buying different fighters, using Ether, to build your collection of CryptoFighters not at all unlike the traditional series of games. Each CryptoFighter has different features that make him or her unique.

These features can range from their fight metrics (Str, Vit, Dex, Luk) but also in their unique genes that are individual to each fighter. For example my [Orc General (#1757)](https://cryptofighters.io/fighter/1757) is a 15, 10, 4, 4 on his fight metrics but also has the unique traits of Orc, Rebel, Classy Outfit, Protective Footwear and Bone Weapon. These different traits make him unlike any of the other CryptoFighters.

Additionally the site now has a section called 'The Arena' which is a place where players can team up 5 of their CryptoFighters to enter the Arena and fight another player’s group of CryptoFighters. Each time a fighter battles it gets stronger and the winner of the battle wins a new CryptoFighter. This new CryptoFighter is distributed based on the fighter that you had lead your team.

## My CryptoFighter Experience Updated
This week has been a lot of ups and downs. I’ve learned a lot and I’ve realized I’ve made a lot of mistakes! For example last week I bought all of my CryptoFighters from the marketplace. Since playing and joining the [CryptoFighter Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/b4Dn8) I’ve found out about a third party site called Opensea.io. Opensea is a store for buying CryptoFighters, and other cryptocollectibles,  for cheaper than what they are offered on the main marketplace. This would have saved me quite a bit in comparison to what I paid for my CryptoFighters.

I actually am under-serving what all Opensea can do for you. It will also allow you to manage your Fighters in a deeper way than what is provided on CryptoFighters.io. Not only does it support gifting, in addition to the marketplace above, you can also view your [account’s history](https://opensea.io/account#activity) to see what you paid for each Fighter.
