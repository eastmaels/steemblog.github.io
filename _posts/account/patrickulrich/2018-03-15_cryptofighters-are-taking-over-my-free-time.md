[Cryptofighters](https://cryptofighters.io/) are Ethereum tokens that are built with characteristics of trading cards like Magic: The Gathering or Pokemon. You can begin buying different fighters, using Ether, to build your collection of CryptoFighters not at all unlike the traditional series of games. Each CryptoFighter has different features that make him or her unique.

These features can range from their fight metrics (Str, Vit, Dex, Luk) but also in their unique genes that are individual to each fighter. For example my [Orc General (#1757)](https://cryptofighters.io/fighter/1757) is a 15, 10, 4, 4 on his fight metrics but also has the unique traits of Orc, Rebel, Classy Outfit, Protective Footwear and Bone Weapon. These different traits make him unlike any of the other CryptoFighters.

Additionally the site now has a section called 'The Arena' which is a place where players can team up 5 of their CryptoFighters to enter the Arena and fight another player's group of CryptoFighters . Each time a fighter battles, it gets stronger, and the winner of the battle wins a new CryptoFighter. This new CryptoFighter is distributed based on the fighter that you had lead your team.

## My CryptoFighter Experience
@clove71 was doing a DLive broadcast a month or so back when she received her first CryptoFighter as the result of a Twitter contest. At the time I had just heard about some other crypto-trading games but nothing really seemed to be for me (nothing against Kitties!) 

That was until I found out that these CryptoFighters are supposed to fight in an arena to determine how new cards are released. That sounded game changing to me! Unfortunately at the time this functionality wasn't built into the platform yet so I didn't want to jump in. Far too many crypto projects sound cool but as soon as the founders get the money they disappear. This certainly didn't happen as a month later they've rolled out The Arena.

I still hadn't heard about this until I was catching another of @clove71's streams the other night and she was doing her first battle in the Arena. I was immediately sold but my problem was that I didn't have any money to buy any CryptoFighters as I had recently moved everything into Steem to prepare to launch @dliveupvote. That was until a lucky accident happened and I found $160 on an old Bitshares account. I quickly traded $60 to Ether and sent it over to my MetaMask.

Now that I'm in to play I'm going to keep track of my CryptoFighter holdings on a regular Steem post. This will not only allow me to track what I have in each fighter but will also let you guys see how I plan to manage this new, and extremely interesting, asset class.

This is just my first couple days using the platform so I'm sure there's a lot more I don't know about. Please share any tips and suggestions in the comments and I'll be sure to keep everyone updated on where I'm at with all of my new fighters!
