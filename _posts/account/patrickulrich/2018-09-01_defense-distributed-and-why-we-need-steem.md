Have you heard of Defense Distributed yet? You may have yet not even realized it. It is Cody Wilson's open-source organization that develops digital firearms files that you should be allowed to download from his site and use to print or mill your own firearms. Unfortunately there are those in America that don't believe in our freedom of speech or right to bear arms and have done their best to limit those rights.

If you have heard of this project it's probably from the recent court battles that Cody has devoted himself to. After initially creating blueprints that would allow anyone with a 3D printer to print a firearm back in 2012 the United States State Department stepped in and gave Cody an ultimatum to either remove the ability to download these prints or go to jail. Cody made the decision to take them down but the fight doesn't end there.

In 2015, Cody's company, Defense Distributed decided to sue the State department seeking a preliminary injunction to allow the information to exist online. This, to me, sounds like a cut and dry case. You have, in the US Constitution, the right that the government will not prohibit the free exercise or abridging the freedom of speech. Since these plans are simply digital information then I do not see how anyone, who believes in our rights to free speech, could justify the move to censoring Cody's ability to distribute his information. Unfortunately the courts did just that.

Again, the story doesn't end there. Defense Distributed continued the fight by appealing to the US Supreme Court in January but they rejected his appeal of the lower court's decision. This led many, including myself, to feel that we might not be seeing justice for our rights. That was until on June 29th the State Department agreed to settle with Defense Distributed and allow the plans to be posted online. I remember sharing that news release with many, many friends as if we had just won a huge battle.

That was until, hours before the plans were scheduled to be back on the site, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order to prevent the settlement from moving forward. This has recently led to District Judge Robert Lasnik granting a preliminary injunction which will bar the blueprints from being posted online for free distribution until a court case is resolved.

## How does Steem come into this?

The first part is that Steem will finally end this type of censorship. While governments may require certain condensers to stop showing select content, based on their geographic hosting location inside of the United States, they will never be able to remove a post from the actual blockchain. That means if Cody's designs were to be posted here they could not be removed from the actual chain regardless of what the courts were trying to demand. That in of itself is a game changer but that's not all.

#### It's Not Just The Government Censoring Cody

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">YouTube has deleted every Ghost Gunner and DEFCAD video Iâ€™ve ever made.</p>&mdash; Cody R. Wilson (@Radomysisky) <a href="https://twitter.com/Radomysisky/status/1035918951845257216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2018</a></blockquote>

This morning @radomysisky, Cody Wilson's Twitter handle, posted that YouTube has deleted every piece of Ghost Gunner's content he's ever made from their site. This, to my knowledge, was without warning. He just logged in and it was gone. I can certainly sympathize as the same thing happened to me last year when Google, YouTube's parent, took down my Bitcoin collection on their social networking platform.

This also shows that government censorship is no longer the only thing to fear and potentially not even the worse part to fear. That's because platforms like Google's aren't covered by our Bill of Rights. That's because they are not government properties and presumably have the right to allow what content they want on their own platforms. While I support their rights to allow what meets their needs, I can clearly see how this could become an issue for individuals like Cody and myself. 

This is why I moved all of my content production to Steem! Steem ensures that what we post will be distributed across the globe to our beloved blockchain and that no one will be able to stop that from happening. I don't have to worry if someone will take over Steemit Inc who doesn't believe in liberty. They can't censor the blockchain. I've now sent messages to Cody in hopes he will do the same thing!

## How can I help stop this kind of censorship?

You can start by sending messages of encouragement to Cody on Twitter. While you're there please consider liking and retweeting my reply to his announcement this morning where I offered to set him up and reupload all old content to our beloved dapps that are built on Steem.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Radomysisky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Radomysisky</a> you should bring them over to <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialDLive?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OfficialDLive</a> on the Steem blockchain! They will not be deleted here. Plus maybe you can earn enough Steem from them that you can send me a Ghost Gunner! ðŸ˜„</p>&mdash; Patrick Ulrich (@patrick_ulrich) <a href="https://twitter.com/patrick_ulrich/status/1035920389824819200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2018</a></blockquote>

The more Cody can realize that his message can have a reach on this platform then the more likely he will be willing to pursue using our platform. 

The second thing you can do is help fund Cody's battle against tyranny. If you head over to https://defcad.com/donate/ you will be able to join the fight by donating Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or good ole fiat. For the first time in my life I will encourage you to convert your funds to Bitcoin Cash to donate to this cause. That's because Bitcoin.com is sponsoring this project and will match any donations submitted using Bitcoin Cash. I don't even feel dirty to say that in this cause!
