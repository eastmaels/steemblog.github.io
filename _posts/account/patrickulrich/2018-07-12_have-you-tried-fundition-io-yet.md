What's up everyone! Have you heard of [Fundition.io](https://fundtion.io) yet? It's a crowdfunding platform (think Kickstarter or GoFundMe) but built on the Steem blockchain. I just accepted a role of becoming a Fundition Angel to begin helping new users find out as much as possible about the site and community. I've answered a few generic questions below but if you have any more please let me know in the comments or shoot me an email and I'll be happy to get back to you!

## What is crowdfunding?

Crowdfunding allows you to post a request for funding where anyone can then contribute towards your project to help you get the financial resources you need to get make it a reality! Crowdfunding has been used to help a wide range of projects take off ranging from huge platforms like Oculus Rift all the way down to personal needs.

## What makes Fundition different?

There's too many reasons to list here! Fundition is completely disrupting the traditional crowdfunding model by offering features that no other site has offered to date. It's the first project that is built on Steem allowing people to contribute without them having to spend their own money. Beyond that Fundition changes the game by making contributions immediately available directly from your backers with no fee as a middle man! If that doesn't seem amazing just think that most sites take at least 3% from founders right off the top of their project.

## What can I request funding for on Fundition.io?

Here's the exciting part, anything! Do you have an idea that can change the face of Steem but no money to make it a reality? Post it up and explain your goals! Want to start your own business but no funds to start off? Get creative and build some support! Need money to help you pay a medical expense that is overwhelming you? Fret not you might find a generous soul that is willing to back you.

## How can I help back someone's project?

There's a few methods to help someone achieve their goals. Just like any other funding site you can contribute money to their project in the form of a donation. Donations can be done by using your Steem or SBD but can also be made with most other major cryptocurrencies. Soon there will even be options to use traditional fiat methods for sending hearts to your favorite projects!

Beyond sending money directly another innovative change is the ability to send value by just upvoting posts by the founder. These 'free hearts' don't cost you anything but still contribute hearts towards a projects success. Imagine what that could mean for your group's success!

The most interesting way to contribute without sending any money is by acting as a collaborator to a project. Collaborators can work with founders to make updates that will bring in more funds while also raising visibility to the projects success. Just another reason that Fundtion is a real game changer compared to the old methods of raising funds!
