 Kentucky football added to its 2020 recruiting class with a commitment from Alabama prep offensive lineman Joshua Jones.

I personally feel like this was a big pick up for the Cats. Not only for the fact that Jones will be a strong lineman but more so for that Jones picked UK over some of the best names in the SEC. 

Jones had offers from schools like LSU, Tennessee, Mississippi State, Florida State and NC State. The fact he will be attending UK over those names means that UK football is finally solidifying it's name. It means that last year's success is paying off on the recruitment trail as well.
