# Have you heard of SteemHunt yet?
If you like to check out new products then you may want to read more about it! [Steemhunt](steemhunt.com) acts a lot like ProductHunt but is built for the Steem chain. As you seek out new products, upvote on other's submissions or even comment on them you may be rewarded with STEEM tokens for your contribution to the community! It's a wonderful way to interact with the Steem chain while sharing products you think others could benefit from or would find useful.

Steemhunt is only going to keeping growing too. To create an economy of influencers they plan to expand the current Steemhunt into three sections. From their past Steem posts they describe these as:

> [Steemhunt] - a community where hunters introduce cool new products
[Reviewhunt] - a marketing channel where makers suggest bounty missions for hunters
[Ideahunt] - a Kickstarter-like platform where makers run crowdfunding campaigns for hunters

## Enter the SMT!

Like a lot of other projects that are built on the Steem chain, SteemHunt will be issuing their own token known as HUNT. This will allow them to not only reward hunters with STEEM but also their own specialized HUNT token that you'll be able to convert freely on the SMT marketplace. Before that happens though they will be offering them to users in the form of an airdrop that you can take advantage of now!

As you can see in the graphic above up to 250 million of these tokens will be airdropped to the community in various forms. Steemhunt as a company will retain 150 million for their operations. Finally 100 million will be sold in private sales. Of these allocations, I'd like to dig a little bit deeper at the airdrop portion though.

Up to 30M will be dropped to content contributors along with another 30M to those taking part in voting/promotion of those posts. These will be distributed at 120,000 tokens each day until the launch of the SMT with 60,000 for new hunts, 40,000 for those who upvote and 20,000 for those who resteem content. This will allow you to grow your share of the new platform by adding content to Steemhunt today. 

You can also earn today by sponsoring @steemhunt with a SP delegation to contribute a total of 45M new HUNT tokens. Each day Steemhunt will be distributing 90,000 tokens proportionately to those taking advantage of the program by releasing them based on each Steemians delegated portion of the total share of delegation. This is computed every Monday with a new sponsor report that you can find on the @steemhunt profile.

Another 45M will be delivered to users who refer new users to the platform. This will be calculated at 90,000 tokens each day with 1/n at a maximum cap of 5,000 per person. Unfortunately this portion is not ready to be taken advantage of as the referral interface isn't set up yet. Once it goes live then you will not only earn tokens but your referree will do the same.

The majority of this airdrop is actually going on now in the form of an airdrop to SP holders that will be ending soon. This is available to any Steemian who takes advantage of claiming before September 13th, 2018. Once you hit your Steemhunt wallet you'll see a 'SP Claim' button that will allocate you with a 1:1 airdrop based on your SP. So far there's only been a little over 13M HUNT claimed by 5,107 Steemians. You can start your allocation now at https://steemhunt.com/wallet. I'm fortunate that @ericwilson mentioned this to me as I could have easily let my share be burned.

I hope you will consider utilizing this platform. While you will continue earning STEEM you will also be gathering a new token that you will be able to trade come March when the SMT market becomes live. Who knows what these tokens will be worth in relation to STEEM but anything will help you gain in the SP leaderboard and thus help you advance that much more!
