It seems like only weeks ago the temperature was still sailing in the 80s but when I walked out of my office tonight I was greeted with a surprise of a light snowfall over my car. It's a quick reminder that the days of shorts and sandals are long behind us to be replaced with heavy sweaters and boots for the coming months.





I've never been a big fan of this time of year. I enjoy spending more time outdoors and being able to catch a good baseball game. That being said I force myself to remember that there are seasons for a reason. A harsh winter only makes those first few days of spring that much more enjoyable. It makes you cherish those first 65 degree days when you start to see the birds flying back in. So I guess I'll learn to cherish my wintery snag before the days of planting a garden and spring training in baseball come back around to us. Here's to you winter and all the fun you'll bring us this year.
