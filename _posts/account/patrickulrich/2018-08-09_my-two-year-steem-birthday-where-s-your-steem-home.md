# Today Was My Two Year Steem Birthday
Man how time flies! Two years ago I was reading a Coindesk article about this new cryptocurrency that was trying to tie social networking with a digital currency. It seemed like a wild idea so I hesitated joining at first but ended up making the plunge. Two years later and you could easily say that Coindesk article changed my life!

# Thank You All
My journey wouldn't be the same without YOU! Just like any social network your enjoyment is tied to the engagement you get from your followers so my time here would have been a lot less fun if it wasn't for my followers supporting me. It took a second for me to realize but support on Steem comes in different formats. While you expect tons of comments on your writings or upvotes it doesn't always come like that. Sometimes it's a resteem but what I've come to appreciate more is the silent follower. The guy (or girl :) ) that reads your post but never leaves the comment or upvote then you start scrolling through posts and find that they actually reference your content or an idea you shared on their posts. That's when it hits you that people are here but you don't always see them. 

# Make Steem Your Home Too
Like I've said Steem can be a magical place. You just have to find your space in the community to get started. Maybe you're a long form writer and you've loved posting on Medium in the past. Then you'll probably thoroughly enjoy the main Steemit interface. This isn't always me. In fact I don't know what I always enjoy to be honest. Sometimes I enjoy sharing a picture that grabbed my attention and sometimes I enjoy playing a video game with my followers. It turns out there's a home for you on Steem in each of these instances. If you ever have a end up having a question about this place I'm more than happy to help you try to find the answer for it. Just leave me a comment and let me know what you need and I'll do my best to help you find an answer.

## Steem Is Full of dApps
While most people find Steemit.com to be interaction on the Steem blockchain, if you haven't guessed already, there's way more to it than that. All these other dApps are still saving your content and posts to the Steem blockchain but they may show content in a completely new, and sometimes wildly different, interface.

### I Prefer More Basic Social Media Style Lifestyle - Busy.org
I bet you would like the guys over at [Busy.org](https://busy.org). Busy makes Steem much more graphically friendly and adds some features that just aren't available on the main Steemit implementation. There's a wide assortment of these features but some of the things I really appreciate is their refined interface as well as notifications based on interactions with you from other users.

### I Love To Share Pictures With the World - Steepshot
Then you probably appreciate Instagram when you're not on the Steem chain right? What if I told you there was a site that was a lot like IG but was all based on the Steem chain and offered you rewards for sharing? That's right [Steepshot](https://alpha.steepshot.io) is probably going to be your new social media home. You can upload a picture right from your Android or iOS device and check out pictures from others across the globe by following the tags you appreciate most.

### I Really Just Want to Watch A Video - DLive.tv
You must enjoy YouTube then huh? Well I have something way better for you now. It's called [DLive.tv](https://www.dlive.tv) and you can watch people stream live video shows or watch videos that others upload. Even better you may enjoy creating this content and now you have a home where you can earn some Steem for free by sharing your videos to one of the fastest growing dApps we have.

### Social Funding - Fundition.io
Do you enjoy perusing Kickstarter for interesting ideas or GoFundMe for a cause you believe in and want to support. You're going to really appreciate all the work that's happening on [Fundition.io](https://fundition.io)! Fundition allows anyone in the world to post a project and receive support across the globe for any cause they want.

### I Just Want Track My Fitness - Actifit
Do you love to run or track your activity? Then you're going to want to jump in the Google Play Store and download [Actifit](https://actifit.io)! Not only will it do some basic activity tracking but you can earn Steem as well as Actifit tokens for sharing your efforts directly from the app. You're already doing the activity why not make some money from it too?

### I'm All About The Jams - DSound

### Show Me The Games - SteemGG
This is actually one of the newer platforms I've seen on Steem and I've been spending a lot of time here. Remember the old Flash gaming sites from a decade ago? Now HTML game devs can monetize their creations by posting them to [SteemGG](https://steemgg.com) and gamers like me can enjoy some interesting creations! Be sure to check out Towner Defense and see if you can beat my 45 round high score! :)

### I Know All The Good Products! - SteemHunt
Are you a big fan of finding the best deals on the internet? You will definitely want to visit [SteemHunt](https://steemhunt.com/) so you can share them with your followers! It's very similar to what you've probably come to expect from traditional sites like ProductHunt but now you can earn Steem just by sharing your knowledge.

### I'd Prefer To Just Share Links - dlike
Are you a Pinterest addict because you like to share the cool things you find on the internet? You're going to appreciate [dlike](https://dlike.io/) then! Simply drop the URL of your special article in their site and you'll be on your way to earning Steem and dlike tokens for your efforts. It's that easy!
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmW7mJm2y1bwggen7GPzivoBeMGUSqV5xrwv4gvpRwbnDk/image.png)

### I Just Need Answers! - Musing
This is another platform that is new to me. It's very similar to Quora where anyone can ask the community for answers and get crowd-sourced answers by other Steemians that might have more experience in that field. Not to mention it's a way for you to also earn Steem! Be sure to give it a try at [Musing.io](https://musing.io/)
![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZPQRTvUJLu5Ser9LvB1oD73khMeH9juMAppCDuJgQN31/image.png)

### I Need Better Healthcare - Air Clinic
This is by far one of the best things I've found to date to help people across the globe. Are you feeling a cold coming on or have another symptom that's bothering you? You can earn Airtokens that you can trade in to speak with an actual medical professional through [Air Clinic](https://myairclinic.com/). They even have the ability to give a prescription for your ailment! This is a real game changer for anyone who's unable to seek traditional healthcare but needs to speak with a doctor.

### Just Let Me Tweet Already! - Zappl
I get it! Twitter's 280 characters really let's you get that quick message out to your audience in a way few platforms have been able to reproduce. The team behind [Zappl](https://zappl.com) is trying to do just that though with a modest 240 characters. It doesn't matter if you're mobile or on the web just drop a quick message in and now you'll get the benefit of earning some Steem for your thoughts!

### I Enjoy Helping Others With Coding - Utopian.io
This was one of the first outside the box dApps I came in contact with. [Utopian.io](https://utopian.io) is built to help spur development for FOSS (free and open source software) projects. After signing up you can submit your code adjustments to GitHub projects straight from the Utopian website. From here there's a team of moderators who will review your revisions and reward you with Steem upvotes for helping contribute to the code on these projects. This is a true game changer and can now encourage developers to spend time on projects that help out society as a whole with actual value instead of just the feel good kind.

As you can see there's a lot more to this place than just the usual thought of Steemit.com and this is just the beginning. New dApps are being developed every day and it can become nearly impossible to keep up with them all. If I've left your Steem home out let me know in the comments!

# Until My Third Birthday
I just have to say thank you again! This place really wouldn't be the same without each of you sharing your life and ideas with me. It's not only gave me a great way to pass the time reading or watching but has broadened my horizon by 1000 levels. I truly enjoy reading your comments and can't wait to see what this place looks like when I write my 3rd, 4th and 5th birthday messages.
