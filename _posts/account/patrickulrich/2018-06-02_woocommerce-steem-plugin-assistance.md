I'm seeking the Steem community's assistance in updating @recrypto's [WooCommerce Steem plugin](https://github.com/recrypto/woocommerce-steem) to be able to work again. 

If you're not familar with WooCommerce Steem then I must say it is an incredible tool. What it does is allows anyone to sell products from Wordpress by accepting Steem or SBD for payment. When working it would query the Steem network for the payment then make all of the adjustments to WooCommerce orders based on finding the sent transaction.

Unfortunately the plugin stopped working once the Steemful node went offline and has never came back. The plugin just needs a way to query the blockchain to find any sent transactions but I'm not equipped to make it happen myself. If you feel you would be interested in helping bring this plugin back to life please leave a comment below and let me know what you would need to get it back online.
