I just purchased The Show and about to dive in for my first play. Come join me! Not expecting anything exciting but figured why not bring all the Steemians in for the fun?

For anyone that would like to join in the conversation please feel free to drop into the general Voice Channel at the [DLive Community Discord](discord.dlive.community). You can also feel free to add me on PSN using the tag asdr24.
