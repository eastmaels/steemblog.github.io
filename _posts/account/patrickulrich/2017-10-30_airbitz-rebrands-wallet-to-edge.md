Airbitz announced via [medium](https://medium.com/airbitz/airbitz-is-now-edge-461fff6af2d0) that their beloved Bitcoin wallet would be rebranding to become Edge Wallet. 

This rebrand won't be just in a name though. While highlighting Airbitz's unique client side security they will now expand the features of the platform to include additional currencies plus a way to seamlessly convert between them and also new tech that will enable lower payment fees.

The new currencies that will be supported out of the gate are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Augur REP, Wings, and Matryx tokens. These won't be the only coins to gain support either. Since the new wallet is written from the ground up Airbitz built a new modular architecture that will allow it to be able to secure and transact with any blockchain or token through a simple plugin. This will enable developers to contribute their support and see their currency available on the Edge platform.

Finally some new features that will be included is the ability to natively use Shapeshift.io to convert tokens from one chain to the other. This will save users the step of sending the coins to Shapeshift thus reducing the risk of error for conversions. They have also enabled SegWit support for both Bitcoin and Litecoin which should help wallet users by giving them a smaller tx and thus lower fees.

While Edge Wallet is currently in an limited release at the moment but you can request an email invitation by heading [here](http://unbouncepages.com/edge-beta-signup-2/).
