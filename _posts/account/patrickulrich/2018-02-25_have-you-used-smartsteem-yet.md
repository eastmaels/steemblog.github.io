If you would like to buy a vote from @smartsteem then all you have to do is send at least 0.50 SBD to @smartsteem with a link to your post in the memo field. From there you will be entered into the next smartsteem voting pool and receive an upvote proportional to your stake in the voting pool. It's an excellent way to help build up your reputation and Steem rewards.

If you would prefer to sell your vote for @smartsteem to use then all you have to do is go to @smartsteem's [website](https://smartsteem.com?r=patrickulrich) and then hit 'Sell Upvotes' along the top of the screen. From there you will set your preferred power threshold and how often you'd like automatic payouts then save and get started. From here the bot will vote on your behalf and you will earn rewards based on what that vote was sold for. It's a great way to earn a few extra SBDs along the way.

Additionally you can also delegate your SP to @smartsteem but then you don't have it to vote along the way. If you would prefer to still go that route then you can simply hit 'Delegate Steempower' at the top of their [website](https://smartsteem.com?r=patrickulrich).  Then hit the blue delegate button and determine how much you'd like to delegate to @smartsteem. From there you will earn a reward based on how much you've delegated to them.
