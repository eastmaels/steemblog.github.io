We took the night to discuss a range of topics while mostly staying tied to US midterm election coverage. My apologies for the early sound issues. There was an issue with the audio input so a bit of the early discussion was cut out. Don't worry this is a long one so there's plenty more to see.





@thesteemingpile is an open space live broadcasting project for the Steem & @vimm community. We set up the theme and create the agenda live on air. We are just getting started so feel free to jump on the pile.





We usually livestream each episode starting at 9:30pm EST on Tuesday nights using the vimm.tv network. You can find my channel on vimm at vimm.tv/@patrickulrich.
