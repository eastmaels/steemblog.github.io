While this is my first post, I've actually been around here for some time. I've enjoyed reading content from a lot of different users and have always recommend that friends and family check the platform out. Unfortunately their next question was always what is your steem page? I'd then have to respond that while I think the platform is amazing I hadn't actually posted anything. That changes today!

First off I'm married to a lovely lady named Kati. She really is my rock and supports me through all my adventures. She even does an alright job of keeping me within the lines when I start to get a little too creative. I couldn't be who I am without her.

As much as she means to me though I doubt that will be why you would keep up with my posts. For that I would imagine we will probably need to have some shared interests.  While I enjoy lots of different sports and political topics my main interest has been bitcoin and digital currencies for some time. That will probably be the majority of what I actually end up posting about on here. In fact I imagine it will be very similar to my Google+ profile where I've been sharing bitcoin news and updates for since early 2015.

Speaking of having a wife that supports me. I actually quit my regular day job a couple months back to pursue growing the crypto space in my home state of Kentucky. To do this I actually operate 2 different Bitcoin ATMs as well as offer educational services for anyone that wants to learn more.  If you are in the area you should stop by and check one of them out!

Anyways give me a follow if you think you'll find some interesting content. I can't wait to get started actually sharing some!
