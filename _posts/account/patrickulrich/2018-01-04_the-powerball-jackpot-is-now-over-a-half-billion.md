That's $550,000,000! While I know I'll likely never know what it's like to hold that little slip of paper, that's redeemable for more than the GDP of the Marshall Islands, it's tons of fun to imagine. 

I used to play the lottery whenever it would get above a couple hundred million but now I find myself preferring to buy crypto assets over lottery tickets even at these ridiculous jackpots. This revolution has completely changed how I think and I hope how you think as well. Sure the shot of winning a life changing sum is exciting but when you consider the odds it just doesn't add up. 

I would rather buy that same amount of Steem each week and continuously power up everything I make until I could create a life changing value generator. Given the small bit of work in building your social circle this seems like a much better shot then ever holding that little magical slip of paper. 

All that being said I'll continue to enjoy running my imagination over what I'd do if my number was called but don't expect to see me powering up a million new Steem anytime soon.
