Blockstream  developer Dr. Russell O’Connor has released a design for a new programming language at PLAS 2017 that will enable new features to be built into Bitcoin.

Blockstream's blog goes on to describe, "As an alternative to existing cryptocurrency languages, the sequent-calculus-based Simplicity language offers a few major improvements, the first of which is extended capabilities. One of the problems with Bitcoin Script, Bitcoin’s own programming language, is that a number of opcodes were disabled in Bitcoin’s earliest days. For example, you can add numbers in Bitcoin Script, but you can’t multiply them. O’Connor wanted something more flexible."

Dr. O'Connor goes on to say, "Simplicity is a low-level, typed, functional, native MAST language where programs are built from basic combinators.  Like Bitcoin Script, Simplicity is designed to operate at the consensus layer.  While one can write Simplicity by hand, it is expected to be the target of one, or multiple, front-end languages."

While this will help develop new functionality to Bitcoin, like smart contracts, we're still a bit off. Currently the project is still a part of the Blockstream R&D division where Dr. O'Connor and crew will work to create an SDK. From there they hope to merge it into the Elements project so other developers will be able to experiment on sidechains.

There's still a long way to go but this will enable many new features that weren't possible in bitcoin before. To get a deeper understanding of Simplicity check out their [white paper](https://blockstream.com/simplicity.pdf).
