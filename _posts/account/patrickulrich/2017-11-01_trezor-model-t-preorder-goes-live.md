Trezor has launched the preorder page for their Trezor Model T hardware wallet. The first batch of preorders have already been accounted for but they have a second batch that still has 1567 of 2000 as of the time of this posting. You can get in this second batch for â‚¬129.

The Model T is a big refinement over their prior hardware wallet and includes a few new features like a new intuitive touch screen and even more improved security.  It will also sport a type-c connection helping ensure that the device will work on all of your future devices. It will be launching with support for 8 coins with more stated to be on the way. The Model T is expected to begin shipping in January of 2018.

On the device you will now enter your PIN using the new touchscreen. This allows you to authenticate your device without ever giving out any of your key information to the computer you're using. As far as the desktop interface goes if you're familiar with using the Trezor Manager of the old model then you will have no trouble adapting. It appears it will be keeping the same UI on the desktop that we've all grown accustom to.

The device will also be expandable using Trezor Core. This will allow you to build your own applications that require a secure device. As their website states, "Just imagine the possibilities."

You can start your order right now by heading to https://preorder.trezor.io/
