Coinbase has added 150,000 new users in the days following [CME Group's announcement](https://steemit.com/crypto-news/@patrickulrich/cme-group-plans-to-list-bitcoin-futures) that they plan to operate a Bitcoin futures market. While CME is still seeking regulatory approval to launch it appears that users wanting to get in the action aren't waiting around.

If you weren't impressed by Coinbase's recent additions, that are the size of Clarksville, TN, then maybe hearing that they've added a whopping 6.4 million users since the beginning of the year would do the trick. That would be nearly the size of Los Angeles and Chicago's population combined.

I also imagine this influx of users have been affected by the news as well. At one point we had seen nearly a $1,000 pricing increase in Bitcoin since the announcement. I have to imagine this new user base are looking to get involved in the market and see if they can't beat the bulls in.
