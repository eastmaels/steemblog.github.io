We gave this a shot last night and failed so we're back again! We upgraded @katiulrich to an Elgato HD60s but was having problems with her display so we picked up a new monitor today. Stop by her stream and lets us know how it looks!

Back again - monitor cord feel down on our power brick for the internet router. If the Ulrich's are streaming then something has to go wrong!

My live stream is at [DLive](https://dlive.io/livestream/patrickulrich/f2f36506-63b1-11e8-95fb-0242ac110002)
