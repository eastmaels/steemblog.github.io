I'm looking to start a new show focused on reviewing dapps that are built for the Steem blockchain. It's something @ericwilson had encouraged me to do ages ago and I think it would be a cool way to stay up on events while also sharing that knowledge with my community.

Please let me know who you would like to see me showcase first. I'll take all of these suggestions into a dpoll and then open voting for who you'd like to see be the first community on Steem to be looked at. 

Note: there's the chance that whoever we select may not be available to do an interview. While I'll do my best to accommodate guest's schedules there's a chance they won't be available to participate. I completely understand if that's the case and will hope we can work something out in the future. I'll still do my best to review without them!

This is my first post on Palnet.io. It's a second layer condenser for the Steem chain with it's own token. This means that you can earn rewards there in addition to your Steem. It's pretty slick!

Final Note: I have 11 Steem in my account so I'll give the first 10 unique suggestions a SBI share.
