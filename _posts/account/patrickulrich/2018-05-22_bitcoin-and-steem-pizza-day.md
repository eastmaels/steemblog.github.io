# Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day!

Back on May 22, 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz made the first retail bitcoin transaction when he bartered 10,000 BTC for 2 Papa John's Pizzas. At current prices those two pizzas would be worth a smooth $82 million. Tasty, huh?

This was a huge event for cryptocurrencies though. While Bitcoin had been around for over a year it was only used in geeky circles as a pastime and concept. This finally gave a reference point for what the value of a bitcoin could be established at. Now 8 years later we simply value Pizza a whole lot less than we do a BTC (at the time this would have been worth about $40.)

This event has birthed new Pizza milestones for our favorite crypto too. Earlier this year Lazlo returned to make the first ever Lightning powered Bitcoin transaction when he paid 649000 satoshis, or 0.00649 bitcoins, which equals around $62 for both pizzas. (It seems the only thing dropping in these valuations is the reference $)

# Steem Powered Pizza?

This made me stop to think if there's been a Steem Pizza Day yet? If not I'd like to be the first person to make it happen! If you are willing to order me two Pizzas for delivery tonight at 6pm then I will pay $40 worth of STEEM/SBD (roughly 12.780 STEEM or 18.100 SBD) to make it happen.

### The Order
If you would like to be the one to make the first Steem powered Pizza Day a reality then comment below! After we agree on who will order the pizza I will let you call my local Big City Pizza (I wanted to stick with Papa Johns but they didn't want to work with me on the delivery) and tell them you have a delivery order for Patrick. After they receive the order and payment I'll then send your choice of STEEM/SBD back for the purchase.

Big City Pizza - 859.885.0111

Pizza #1 - Large Veggie
Pizza #2 - Large Meat Pizza

The order total should be around $35 from what I've been told by the shop so I will essentially be paying someone $5 to buy $35 worth of Steem. Who's game?
