@fulltimegeek recently posted about potentially deleting his Twitter and moving to a 100% Steem social media life. This opens a great conversation about the benefits of saying you can only find our collective content through Steem. It also highlights the downfalls of walling yourself off. Unfortunately until you control a market you really can't wall yourself off and survive so I'm happy to see that we'll still be able to find FTG spreading the news about the best alternative social media site available on the world's most popular short messaging platform.

## Lost Benefits

One of the biggest downfalls of not being available on other social platforms is that we are disconnected from users who have never participated in our community. This is why it's so unsustainable for us to all start abandoning regular media is because as of right now we just don't have the market power to pull others with us. We miss the chance to grow!

Tonight I was streaming when I was introduced to @zayous. Zayous was tuning into one of my gaming streams on @dlive when he started talking with me.  I always co-stream to @vimm (STEEM FTW!), Twitch (@Share2Steem BABY!), Mixer, DLive and Stream.me so @zayous begins to ask me about what all of the upvotes coming up on my stream meant. I give a basic explanation and tell him to get an account when I realized I still had claimed account tokens available. Thank you again to @pharesim for creating such an awesome tool in [Steem Invite](https://steeminvite.com) to make claiming token easy!

This highlights all in the same weekend why we still need to be working hard to be social outside of our beautiful garden. Sure it's better here and definitely a lot more rewarding but if we don't go out and find others to share this place with then how much good are we really doing? So go forward now and be sure to give a quick follow to @zayous then think how you can bring someone new to Steem. It'd be awesome to grow large enough one day to make shutting off traditional media a sustainable thought!
