I just seen a post from @mrviquez that @steemmonsters have dropped gold foil cards into the game! Not only did they add these new rare cards into future packs they even done a drop to players that have purchased packs already. After I seen his post I quickly logged into steemmonsters.com to find I was awarded 4 of these new special cards into my collection.

Did anyone else score any new cards? If so, what did you end up with?
