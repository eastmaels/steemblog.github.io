I'd like to start by thanking everyone that's made my journey into Steem possible. From my initial point of hearing of it from @jeffberwick to actually making my first post because of @ned's appearance on the @cryptoshow. In @ned's appearance, it was pointed out the hilarity that anyone in crypto is using traditional social media for making announcements and not doing so on Steem.

Since then I've dug much deeper in having embraced the full ecosystem of Steem applications. From getting started on my first Steemit post to becoming more active on @steepshot and a huge fan of watching content on @dtube. I can't wait to see what all 2018 brings in that regard. 

With all of that said, I have to give my biggest thanks to each of you. Social media is about the community you build around yourself. Had I joined and no one was interested in my content, or decided to not take the time to communicate with me, I would have left. That's why I want to spend much more time in #introduceyourself this year. I think having those early connections is so important for people to find value here. So thank you!

I also take pride that this achievement happened to coincide along my birthday today. I hope that this is a sign that this year will bring many great things from the Steem world into my life as I hope to share those with all of you!
