Hey Steemians I could use your advice for a project I'm trying to work on. I'm trying to set up a chart station using some older equipment I have in my office that's been collecting dust. Now I'm just trying to gauge if my idea will work before putting any funds or time into the idea.

<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQFarMpT2PKD29ano2kQVY68sp7BgHnxJDAvWqzfbf7qq/image.png)<br>Relative idea of what I'm trying to accomplish</center>

### The Idea
I have 3 old VGA monitors that I'm wanting to display trading charts for BTC, LTC and Steem while leaving the main laptop screen available to be used for quick notepad type functionality. 

### Equipment
##### This is the equipment I have: 
(3) VGA monitors with VGA cables
(1) Older laptop with 2 USB 2.0 ports (touchpad is broken so 1 USB port is used by a mouse), 1 USB 3.0 port

##### Options I'm Looking To Add
(2) [AmazonBasics DisplayPort to VGA Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CUPAG3S/?coliid=I26A4RSM952P4F&colid=RE2O215X4ZEB&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)
(1) [AmazonBasics 4 Port USB 3.0 Hub](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DQFGH80/?coliid=I1XH5CN61PRP37&colid=RE2O215X4ZEB&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)

### The Problem
I've seen this used on a smaller scale with only one monitor. I know that much would work but my fear is connecting 3 monitors may not be supported by windows or may not have the support for my actual machine to power it.

1) I'm not sure if Windows 10 supports 3 external monitors via a USB connection.
2) Any reason why using a USB hub would cause Windows to not recognize the monitors connected through it?

### Thank you!
Thank you for taking the time to read this even if you don't have anything to add. I appreciate knowing you even stopped to see if you could help. If you do have any ideas or suggestions please feel free to share them below. Even if you just have an interesting idea for what I could do with the old equipment, I'm game. 

Unless someone tells me why this won't work I'll probably give it a shot. Since it's only around $50 it would be of more value just getting everything to be used as opposed to sitting in a corner. However it works out I'll be sure to let everyone know!
