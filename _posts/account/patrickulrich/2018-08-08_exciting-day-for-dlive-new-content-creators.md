I'm extremely excited to introduce two new DLive content creators who have made the move from exclusively posting their content to YouTube to also bringing it to the best streaming dApp on Steem! I hope you will check these guys out and show some love to welcome them to the community!

I've been following Adam on YouTube for well over a year now. He's a huge advocate for having strong hands and holding your bitcoin for the long term. He hosts regular shows like The 1 Bitcoin Show, The Beyond Bitcoin Show and his weekly This Week in Bitcoin which I hope all make their way over to @dlive in time!

Adam travels the world preaching the benefits of personal responsibility and taking control of your wealth. He's spoken to groups all over the United States and even so far abroad as South Africa to help more and more people wake up to the value of everyone's favorite digital asset. You'll be able to find Adam now at http://dlive.tv/@bitcoinmeister.

Originally a strong supporter of precious metals, Andy has made a name for himself in the crpyto space by helping others understand the true value bitcoin. Andy has spent the last few decades in the alternative financial space helping people really understand the values of sound money and their benefits.

Andy hosts a regular one on one interview with some of the greatest names in crypto on the World Crypto Network. When Andy is not providing educational services to the masses through his YouTube work he maintains an excellent  private consultancy service for investors and altcoin developers looking to increase their market penetration. You'll be able to find all of Andy's DLive videos at https://dlive.tv/@andyhoffman.

### Share and Follow
Once again I hope you will give each of these guys a follow and consider supporting their content with your upvotes. I certainly know I will be! If you'd also be so kind please let your crypto friends know that these guys have taken the time to support our community with their presence here. With @dlive you'll be able to enjoy their content without being forced to watch a YouTube ad promoting BitConnect or some other wasteful distraction.
