Man,  I love doing muh show.  Thanks to @sircork, @r0nd0n, @ma1neevent, @uniwhisp and @globocop for helping to make the station run.  Thanks @eturnerx for helping to keep the lights on through your thing that you do.

Told a couple stories.  There was a brief "ask me anything" where we talked about what makes for a good mod, and what makes for a good witness. We spoke a little bit, but not overbearingly long about how global finance is controlled by immoral banksters and how Peace, Abundance, and Liberty are the right response to that.

We listened to some 90s rock and a little bit of classic rock.  So, the toonage was solid.

We played some dice.  The first two round were inconclusive so as I did last week I sent the 25 sbd prize pool off to our newest mod.  in this case it's @travelnurse.  So, she was a recipient of 25 SBD.

We played a second dice game.  This time @diggerdugg kicked in 5sbd and I kicked in 15 sbd.  The action was fast and furious, but again no one could beat my dice roll.  So, we did a 1 time roll off.  And coming in hawt with a 98 out 100 @negativer walked away with 20 SBD.

Last but not least I ran a competition where people in the show had to go out and recruit for the show.  Every person who came in and said who brought them in became eligible for the 1000 SP delegation.  There were 17 entries of folks who joined the show because of recruitment, which helped get the show up to 30 Steemian listeners (still short of @crimsonclad ath of 40 listeners).  Here are the recruiters and recruitees-

Recruiter	Recruitee
choogirl	gohba
choogirl	scooter77
choogirl	shelly
mikepm74	ethandsmith
torico	dingo
morodiene	kitchen
mikepm74	ArbitraryKitten
morodiene	rougebot
mikepm74	shadowspub
mikepm74	topkpop
torico	dunstuff
choogirl	wholesomeroots
choogirl	lunatic
torico	krazykrista
morodiene	negativer
choogirl	ed
choogirl	diggerdugg

The winner by random chance was @mikepm74.  He had the option to split his delegation as he saw fit and decided to keep it all!!!  Boom.  So, I attempted to award him 1000 SP, but I effed up and gave it to a bot I was using as a practice URL for steem connect.  Whoops.  So I undelegated that, and then I sent him 500 delegated steem.  I'll send him another 500 in two days.  He can keep it until he's a dolphin or earns a total of 5,000 Steem.  After that I'll yoink it back and give to another deserving minnow.

I gotta tell ya.  I love being a witness.  I love running muh show.  I love delegating a shit ton of steem to a deserving minnow every week, and I love running PALnet and the MSP and seeing where we go.  Thanks for riding the waves with your host Skanky J.
