<p>So, I was planning on my usual buy nothing day for black Friday. &nbsp;I'm not dying to hand my hard earned post <del>taxation </del>theft money to the corporations that I rail against, but I needed two things. &nbsp;1. &nbsp;I found rock climbing shoes that have a minor arch and are fairly comfortable for 40% off. &nbsp;I climb at least once a week so I can stop being a fatty and just a touch of arch is the next gear step for me since I'm probably not a true beginner anymore. &nbsp;The other thing I needed was some GPUs for my script mining rig that I have created.</p>
<p>Best Buy isn't supposed to match prices with online retailers over the weekend, but I had one of the best buys I went to willing to do it. &nbsp;I showed them this link for an <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150776&amp;cm_re=radeon_470-_-14-150-776-_-Product">xfx Radeon</a> 470 priced at $169.99. &nbsp;The one that didn't match it showed a price of $189.99 at the register. &nbsp;It may have just been this weekend, but all those cards also had a $50 best guy gift card attached to them. &nbsp;So, I picked up my cards at $119, $119, $139, and $139. &nbsp;I have a nitro sapphire 460 in the mining rig, a 480 in my main computer, and I put a 470 in my wife's computer. &nbsp;So, I have 7 cards total, 1 460, 5 470s, and 1 480. &nbsp;Lastly, I have a Antminer S7-LN running as a space heater for my unheated attic office.</p>

<p>The total watts I'm using are-</p>
<p>Antminer 740. &nbsp;Mining Rig 715, Main computer 300, and wife's computer 225. &nbsp;Since I need heat and since I leave the two main computers on all day anyway I'm discounting 640 watts from the space heater because that's what an actual space heater costs, 90 from my computer, and 60 from my wife's.</p>
<p>Total- 2010</p>
<p>adjusted- 1220</p>
<p>Total electric cost- $5.56.</p>
<p>Profit per day- $5.39</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So, I suspect that the numbers will fluctuate some, but that's where it's at today. &nbsp;That's better than earning 0 dollars per day in my savings account.</p>
