So, I was lucky enough to get to visit with my digital friend @brianturner.  He's no longer just my digital friend, but he's my terrestrial buddy now as well.  I used to be fit and a wrestler, but over the years, and especialy with parenthood I haven't been as active.  I've started swimming to lose some weight, but I think I want to get into some weights too.  Especially as I'm trying to work out PAL-Studios (still in some legal and financial discussions) I figure it's better to be thinner.

So, when I came out to San Diego and found out that Brian is nearby we connected.  He took me to a gym.  I took him out to lunch.  He spoke athletics for my channel, and we took some footage of us talking crypto for his channel.

It feels like an equivalent exchange.

Here we are meeting up before the workout!

Here I film him doing a quick tour of the workout that we did.

Brian looked fit online.  Dude is pretty jacked in person.  Not only that, but he's an excellent dude.  If you're looking for fitness advice, vegan living, acne treatment, intro to crypto, or just a good dude then I hope you choose to follow his channel on Steemit.com @brianturner or on youtube at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2ycqdFV0EmY5LmfM9mWkQg.
