<p>You see that image? &nbsp;Maybe you remember seeing it in a book! &nbsp;That's great, but weird, because as far as anyone can tell it doesn't actually exist anywhere. &nbsp;Lots of people remember seeing fat Henry chowing down on his Turkey Leg, but it doesn't exist. &nbsp;People have created lots of images that reference it, but that specific image doesn't orginate from a portrait of him that exists... but you remember seeing it while studying in school? &nbsp;Welcome to the weird world of the Mandela Effect.</p>
<p>There are lots of these. &nbsp;They cover simple things like changes in movie lines. &nbsp;The more serious ones, sometimes called the Toto Effect cover changes to History, Religion, Geography, and Physical Products. &nbsp;Here's a <a href="http://goo.gl/Q1KIRf">short quiz</a> that you can take that asks you about a handful of them. &nbsp;What was your score?</p>
