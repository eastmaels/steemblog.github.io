Wow, another really fun show for you tonight.  I've got two special guests!  @wwf and @an0nkn0wledge.

@wwf is a gentleman by the name of White Walking Feather, formerly known as rob in the page family, best known for the hit documentary UNGRIP.

I can't emphasize enough just how awesome this movie/documentary is for anyone trying to understand the world around them and how it actually operates.  Rob/WWF goes through an alternate explanation of the legal system that suddenly makes the world clearer and more easily understood.  He's successfully defended his rights against an encroaching Canadian government and I think of a role model in the Peace community and those looking to proclaim their freedom from oppression.

I'm also stoked to invite @an0nkn0wledge back on the show.  AK as he's known is an independant investigative journalist that spends hours pouring through documents and puts together comprehensive articles detailing criminal fraud, government suppressed science, and helps piece together the news in a way that tells the story of how some of the current criminals in office got there, what they did, and how they did it.

AK says he's targeting 11pm to hop on the show.

At the end of the show I'll have some time for audience members to chime in with whatever topic they are interested in and the common rules apply.  Share what you want, read what you want, promote what you want, perform, talk, discuss.  We can argue about things like bid bots.  You can do whatever.  it's your time to be on air and talk to a top 20 witness and a live audience about what you think the world should know.

## Logistics

Show starts at 9pm EST.  That's 0100 UTC.  It's hosted at mspwaves.com/listen and in [Discord](minnowpond.org).

If you're looking to be on the show please arrive a few minutes early and make sure your setup doesn't feed sounds from your computer into your microphone (headset and mic are ideal).

## Delegation

I stopped doing personal delegations and instead created a 10k SP account that I add active community members into as autovotes.  If you think you're msp-active than let me know with a quick pitch and i'll consider adding you to the autovote.

## Dice Bitches

We'll play dice for 25 sbd.  If I win twice we'll find a good cause and send monies there.
