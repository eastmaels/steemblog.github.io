<p>If you want to make money on STEEMIT I have some advice. &nbsp;Get famous. &nbsp;Then post on STEEMIT.</p>

<p>STEEMIT does however do a wonderful service. &nbsp;It reminds regular people that their opinions and stories aren't worth shit. &nbsp;Bo Burnham covers the concept well below:</p>

<p>I mean, here's a <a href="https://steemit.com/blog/@sisterholics/sisterholics-features-food-fashion-and-photography-looking-for-new-authors">great post</a> where they are looking for authors to promote. &nbsp;50 people at the time of this writing have upvoted the post. &nbsp;Their collective wisdom and the content quality measure up to a whopping $2.26. &nbsp;Here's another one with a really healthy discussion about dealing with anger. &nbsp;37 people upvoted, 8 nice comments. &nbsp;$0.73 value</p>
<p>I like having a blog. &nbsp;I like the few interactions I get with other people on this. &nbsp;I'm losing hope that normal people will ever make money on this or turn it into a fair platform. &nbsp;yeah, someone may go viral for a few minutes and make something, but it's hard to imagine new people starting out that can grow an appreciable audience on here. &nbsp;Also, I mostly think the economics right now are looking more like a Ponzi Scheme than a freedom loving blogging platform. &nbsp;</p>
<p>1% of the people have 90% of the STEEM Power. &nbsp;That doesn't make any sense to me. &nbsp;I mean, I get it. &nbsp;I can see how folks would want it that way. &nbsp;I just don't think that it's good for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Again, please don't tell me the STEEMIT equivalent of "If you don't like it why don't you move to Facebook-omolioa." &nbsp;The point isn't to bring STEEMIT down, but the hope that if enough people talk about STEEMIT as an oligarchy instead of the cute version of whales and minnows maybe something will change. &nbsp;Probably not though.</p>
