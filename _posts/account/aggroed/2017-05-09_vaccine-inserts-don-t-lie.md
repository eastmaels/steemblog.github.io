OK, vaccines!  They are awesome! They save lives.  You have to take them or you endanger your community.  If you don't take them you are a mortal threat to people around you and have committed a form of violence against those that know they need them.  If you think Vaccines aren't safe then you are clearly an unstable conspiracy theorist.  You are wrong in the head.  You are a public menace.

All you have to do is look at this vaccine insert published by the manufacturer themselves to know this shit is safe.  Look here you moron!

Oh, wait... I mean... well, they are safe.  I mean... well, look, sometimes, in rare cases they do actually cause autism.  That's super rare though... And yes, sometimes, legally and technically speaking the vaccine will cause "SIDS" or sudden infant death syndrome.  Yeah, technically that means the vaccine will in some cases literally kill your kid.  Don't let that stop you though.  If you let it stop you you're endangering the rest of us.
