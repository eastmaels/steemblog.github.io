So, I'll change the name of the show eventually to reflect the new cohost, but for now... you'll just have to live with it.

Steem is a decentralized blockchain.

PALnet is a Discord channel people use to interact who are part of the Steem community.

MSP-WAVES is a broadcast network built within the PALnet discord.

Minnow Mayor Town Hall is a show on that network that is an town hall style meeting where anyone is welcome to come on and talk about any topic.


Show starts tonight at 8pm EST. join us at minnowpond.org
