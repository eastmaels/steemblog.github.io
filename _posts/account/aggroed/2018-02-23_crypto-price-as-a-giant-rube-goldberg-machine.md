While stareing at the btc and ltc price charts over the last few days willing the price of ltc to moon with my brain I started thinking that the price charts go through a very convoluted pathway to simply move up in price just a steady small amount.

The closest parallell for this that I could think of was a Rude Goldberg Machine  You've likely seen these before, but may not know what they are.  It's like the game Mousetrap.  Or one of the giant ball rolly thingys.  The ball rolls down, it hits the thing, which launches the thing, that lands in the thing, which knocks over the thing, whic makes the dominoes fall, which ultimately make the wire trip, and pull down the lever to start your toast in the morning.

Price seems that way to me.  When I look at the chart focus not on the crazy red and green for a moment, but simply focus on the orange below.  It's connecting low point to low point and roughly tracking how by the end of the crazy price ride the outcome is simply a new higher low point.

Essentially all that work to go sky high and drop down in an agonizing two month process is really just much ado about nothing.  I'll some long concocted way to take the lowest point point in the scheme  from 2900 to 5500 or 5500 to 6000.  You're essentially ride a fear and greed roller coaster up some manic high extreme to put yourself through some crazy correction.

Money is made and lost in that journey.  It's neat for sure, but it's a hell of a trip to knock out a new higher low.   This whole thing struck me as I was sharing this with my dad to say yes there is volatility, but that doesn't matter much if you buy in at the bottom or if you hodl for a while since ultimately the price on the whole is just steadily moving up overall.
