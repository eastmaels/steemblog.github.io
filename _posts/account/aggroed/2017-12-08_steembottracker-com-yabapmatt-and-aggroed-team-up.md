So, this weekend I had to go to DC for work and drove from my home in New England.  I had mentioned I was heading south to @yabapmatt beforehand, and he suggested we meet up for dinner.  So, just yesterday night he and I had outselves a little chance to meet.

We ended up talking about bidbots quite a bit, and we figured out that between us we can really turn the bid bot landscape into a much more transparent and easy industry.  We're looking at some new features to the postpromoter bot and trying to figure out how we can service more currencies than what's available now.  We're looking at automating payments for bid bot owners, and thinking through some dashboards that we can add to give much more detailed information to users and owners alike.

So, as of today the postpromoter bot and the steembottracker.com website are 50/50 co-owned by @aggroed and @yabapmatt.  We'll get some more information out about next steps soon, but we wanted to get the word out and let folks know some positive changes are coming.  

## What's the plan? <h2>

To the bid bot owners out there we'll have some additional free and premium services that will be available soon.  To the bid bot users same deal.  The one thing that's certain though is that there will be better information available for everyone on the block and more services that can help connect posters and marketers together!

## Witnesses <h2>

Both @aggroed and @yabapmatt are elected witnesses dedicated to making sure that the HF19 landscape and the Steem platform in general is progressing towards greater transparency and a good financial environment for content creators and platform investors.  We want to ensure that interested people  get their posts promoted and investors have an attractive place to earn rewards.  Despite some controversy bid bots help make steem an attractive place to market posts, which will add value to the platform overall.
