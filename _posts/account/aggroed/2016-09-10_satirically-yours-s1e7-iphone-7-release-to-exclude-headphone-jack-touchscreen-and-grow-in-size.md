<p>In what many industry insiders are calling an extremely bizarre turn of events Apple has unveiled their new iPhone and removed the headphone jack, touchscreen, and have decided to increase rather than decrease the size of the latest model.</p>
<p>The company promises that their newest experience will likely mimic the experience their target audience of 30-50 year olds experienced when they were growing up. &nbsp;Tim Cook likened the move to Netflix putting out the extremely successful Stranger Things series, a thriller created in 2015 that echoes life children growing up in the 80s.</p>

<p>The company has been surprised the rather lackluster reception with taunts thrown their way by industries even outside the tech industry.</p>

<p>Multiple parodies have been created of the announcement:</p>

<p>It appears as though Tim Cook will have to do some heavy tap dancing as the announcement does not bode well for the company stock price.</p>
