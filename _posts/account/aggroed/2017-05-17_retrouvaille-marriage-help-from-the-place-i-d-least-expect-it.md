So, I'm pretty down with the Great Pumpkin Spirit, but if you try to get me in a church for more than an hour a year we're going to have a hard time being buddies.  Love nature, love the universal consciousness, really down with we're all one entity expericing itself from lots of different fractals, but religion?!?  Like Catholics?  Where the Pope just let off the hook all the child rapists...  Those guys?

Yes, those guys.  I'm 38.  I've been married since I was 23.  There have been hard times.  The last place I thought I'd go was the catholic church for help, but they run this program called Retrouvaille.  It's pretty amazing.  It's an intense multi-weekend retreat that forces couples to relearn how to talk to each other.  It was actually a pretty beautiful thing, though hard as hell to go through.

Expect lots of deep soul searching regarding areas where you and your spouse have hurt one another... that said... we're in the same house.  Going on 15 years.  So, I gotta say it works.

If you're in a marriage that started as a honeymoon, ended up feeling like two singles living together, then hit rock bottom misery you're not alone.  Those are the stages of marriage.  Most couples can't make it past the misery to refind and "rediscover" the emotional connection afterward.  This is a program that might help.


With love, and if you need this I'll send some love and reiki along with this post.  Hang in there.  It can actually get better if you both remember why you love each other and put in the work.
