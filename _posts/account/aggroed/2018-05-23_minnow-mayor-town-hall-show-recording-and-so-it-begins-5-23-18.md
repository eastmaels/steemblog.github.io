Hey folks!  It's that time again to present the Minnow Mayor Town Hall show recording.  I'm especially excited about this one.  Not only did I have some great guests on, but we unveiled in a minor way Steemmonsters.com.  At some point soon I'm going to launch a post into trending to show people that it's ready, but we're still slow playing the launch a little and I'm finding alpha testers for the alpha site.

Steem Monsters is a collectible card game with RPG elements.  You control summoners and the summoners will call forth powerful monsters to battle one another in the tournaments of the day.  You'll receive a variety of prizes for your efforts!

You can buy or earn cards and those cards will gain experience and level up as you use them in battles.  The summoners will buff your monsters and your monsters will win glory for you in the battles!

## Game is still in alpha

Right now you can get a starter pack for $5.  Eventually the starter pack will be more expensive, but we're launching it with a slightly less expensive starter pack.  You can buy booster packs for $2.  You can see your monster collection.  You can collect duplicates of monsters.  Here's what the beastiary looks like-

We'll make it so you can level your monsters faster by combining cards of the same type.  

Pretty soon you'll be able to gift packs or move packs to other people, and we'll open up card trading between players.  We'll take a small cut (planning for 10% or less) of every trade that happens and we're planning to use at least half the cut we take to fund prize pools for the tournaments.  I'm also planning to throw some witness rewards into some starter tournaments so I'm hoping one of the first ones is for 1,000 SBD!

## Steemmonsters.com is currently live
Yeah, there's no waiting.  I'm not gonna send this post into trending.  And I buried some of this in a Minnow Mayor Town Hall post to give a little sneak preview to a handful more people that check out steemmonsters.com.  We talk about it more in the video and hopefully you'll check that out too.

## Kickstarter

I'm planning on making a kickstarter for the game.  I'd like to get more exposure of Steem by using Steem Monsters as a draw to the platform.  Should be fun so stay tuned for that.

## Clayboyn's deep dream image generator

Clay was kind enough to take an awkward photo of me from the stream and hit it with the deepdreamgenerator.  It made something pretty cool.  So, I've included it here for your viewing pleasure.
