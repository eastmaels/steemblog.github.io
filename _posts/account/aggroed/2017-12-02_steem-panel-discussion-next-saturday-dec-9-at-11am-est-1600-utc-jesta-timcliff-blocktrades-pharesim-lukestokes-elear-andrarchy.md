In a similar vein to the Steem Growth Forum I'm hosting a Steem panel discussion on the mspwaves broadcast station.  In the comments below write questions you would pose the panel members and we'll have a 1-2hr discussion about life on the block and needs for the block.

## The Panel <h2>

The panel is comprised of @jesta, @timcliff, @blocktrades, @pharesim, @lukestokes, @elear, and @andrarchy.  I'll moderate the panel discussion.

## Topics generally include <h2>
Growth of the platform
Factors that alter Steem price
Technical needs of the platform
Development of apps and tools
New user experience
Social aspects

## Vision 2020 <h2>
Where does the platform need to be in 2 years to compete? What will it look like?  What do we need to do to get there?

## Logistics <h2>

The panel will be held on Dec 9 from 11am-1pm EST (1600-1800 UTC).
The discussion can be listened to during the broadcast at mspwaves.com/listen.
You can interact with the panel by being in the live audience chatroom in the PALnet Discord-
