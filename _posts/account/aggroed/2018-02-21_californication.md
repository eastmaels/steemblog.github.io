I'm out visiting my Dad this week out in California.  One of the things that I truly enjoy is the ability to drive my Dad's dream car.  Back when he was in his 20s he had a 1964 1/2 Mustang.  My grandfather had them too.  Dad did pretty well financially in his life and one of the gifts he gave himself was this classic Mustang.  

I remember one of the best days of my life as being when I drove around in one of these predecessors.  I was on I-5 right next to the ocean.  I was driving a classic Mustang that purred when it idled and roared when it was go time.   I had 20 bucks in my wallet, and I had a beautiful girlfriend I was sharing the day the with.

## The bluffs <h2>

After heading to the ocean in the Mustang I went out and took a walk on the bluffs.  This bluff walk is one of my favorite views in the world.  You got a blue sky, deep blue water, and a touch of desert landscape.

## It's a touch of a vacation <h2>

I'm still online a ton, still checking DMs, still working on projects, but with a nice change of scenery and a nice  a visit with dad.
