<p>I'm announcing an art contest for Steemers. &nbsp;I'm front loading it with $30 SD to start and will donate any of the SD rewards from this post to the winner and possibly a runner up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>3 weeks ago I started a YouTube page that has since gotten 700k hits. &nbsp;It's something I intend to keep doing so I figure I should try to make it a little nicer.</p>
<p>The focal point of the image should be the words "Teach the Controversy." &nbsp;I don't have a lot of ideas beyond that.</p>
<p>The size of the image should be 2560x1440 and a max of 4mb.</p>
<p>The things I like for this channel involve studying conspiracies to figure out what parts are factual and provable and share those conclusions to separate the internet weirdos and freaks from people actually trying to expose the fraud in the system.</p>
<p>Modern banking is a ponzi scheme.</p>
<p>Big pharma is transparent with "harm" right in the title of their industry.</p>
<p>Agriculture needs to go back to its "roots" and avoid chemicals</p>
<p>My primary objectives doing this are to obtain Peace, Abundance, and Liberty for everyone on the planet.</p>
<p>My primary fear is answering to my kids one day "Dad, you knew about this? &nbsp;What did you do?" and making sure I have a good answer.</p>
<p>Any Steem Dollars generated from this post will go to the winner and possibly runner ups. &nbsp;Thanks for your time and I look forward to your submissions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Please post either a submission or a sample image as a point of reference in the comments below.</p>
