<p>You probably haven't heard of the name Seth Rich.  You've probably never seen this young man.  He's now dead.  The most likely reason is that he was murdered for a nearly unspeakable crime.  He betrayed the Clintons. </p>

<p>Wikileaks hasn't exactly gone fully public with the story, but I'm betting the reason he's dead is that he's the DNC leak that got wikileaks access to all those emails on HRC's private server.  He worked for the campaign.  There are published pictures of other staffers having access to the accounts most notably <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/09/30/hillary-clinton-huma-abedin-email/" rel="noopener">Huma</a>.  So, it doesn't seem like that big of a stretch that a team of people that were lax on email security and high on previous body counts made this betrayer pay in blood.</p>
<p>Read the article that wikileaks themselves post <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/who-seth-rich-wikileaks-offers-reward-info-murdered-dnc-staffer-2399433" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
