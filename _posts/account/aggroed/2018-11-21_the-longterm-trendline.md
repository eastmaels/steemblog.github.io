I saw this on a Tone Vays video.  I saw it again on @samstonehill's wall.  I know.  Life sucks at the moment.  it's doom and gloom, but that trend line has been around for a while now.  it puts btc at 70k by 2021.  That's if it's again at the bottom of the trend line.  It'll be higher.

So, just calm yo' tits.  Buy the dip.  Gift yourself and your buddies steem and steem monsters for xmas this year!

Could it go down more?  yes!  Is bitcoin doomed forever?  No!

This seems like a great time to enter the market.  Oh, and incidently this is part of how btc keeps growing.  These boom and bust cycles allow new entry points for users, which make more people try to hold bitcoin, which makes the value of any individual coin rise over time.  it blows for btc right now and certainly hurts the alt coins, but muh dudez, the next ATH goes even higher because of the current dip.

Write some posts.  Build a buisness.   If you can find some work that pays in crypto now's the time to get it!!!  Accept it at the lows.  Cash out at the highs.  Stick a "for hire" sign on your wall.  Get some writing, translating, art, music, coding done, hodl for a bit, and realize that by doing that you can 10x or more your wages by the next ATH.

*Not financial advice.  Do your own due diligence.  It's on you if you sell your house to buy Steem Monsters cards.  I don't know your circumstances so it's impossible to tell you if selling everything you own and purchasing a lot of gold foil legendaries is right for you.  This post is for cheerleading, entertainment, promotion, and idea planting.
