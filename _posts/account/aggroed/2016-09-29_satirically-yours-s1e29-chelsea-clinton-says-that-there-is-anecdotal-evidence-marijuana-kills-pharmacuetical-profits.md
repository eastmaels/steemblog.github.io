<p>In a fairly irregular press conference and campaign stop made recently by Chelsea Clinton, daughter of Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Clinton and <a href="http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/huge-scandal-chelsea-isnt-bill-clintons-daughter/"><del>Webb Hubbell</del></a> former Democratic President and known philanderer Bill Clinton, she made it known just how dangerous marijuana can be to corporate profits.</p>
<p>After a public campaign stop and fund raiser Chelsea attended another fund raiser at a separate private pharmaceutical company event.</p>

<p>She said "There are many medical discoveries that over time have proven effective at generating money. &nbsp;You can obtain long term very profitable patents on them. &nbsp;You can then remix the same ingredients and repackage the same drugs, but apply for a new patent on them. &nbsp;This is a good industry! &nbsp;Hell, we can even mandate the use of some of this stuff! &nbsp;How awesome would it be to have a president who supports us all, right?" &nbsp;She gave a big wide mouthed hedge fund owning shit eating grin.</p>

<p>She continued "What isn't helpful is when low cost, farm raised, easy-to-grow crops, that can come straight from your back yard get involved! &nbsp;No one wants that! &nbsp;We have all seen the stories of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/07/05/ten-years-after-decriminalization-drug-abuse-down-by-half-in-portugal/&amp;refURL=https://duckduckgo.com/&amp;referrer=https://duckduckgo.com/">how narcotics and prescription pill usage drops after legalization of drugs</a>. &nbsp;We can't allow marijuana legalization to kill any profits, and we want you to know that if there's a Clinton in the White House we won't let you down."</p>
