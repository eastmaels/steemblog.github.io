So, here's the thing.  You and YOU are not the same thing.  "You" is a human being.  "YOU" is a corporation.  Let's try it with a realish example.  Aggroed is a flesh and blood human being.  AGGROED is not.  

Try it like this... Kelly Clark and Clark Kelly aren't the same thing.  Celly Klark and CELLY KLARK aren't the same thing either.  Changing the punctuation changes the meaning and the thing.  Upper Lowercase is a flesh and blood human.  UPPER LOWERCASE is a corporation.

OK, so now that you have that little basic thing down you can start seeing what the state does and the fraud they are pulling on you.

Look at your driver's license.  It says NAME LASTNAME on it.  Not Name Lastname.  You are a corporation in the eyes of the state.  That's fucked up right?  The state doesn't engage you as a flesh and blood person in commerce or in law.  They engage a corporation made in your name in commerce and in law.  It's called your strawman.

Now, that's not enough.. you actually have 3 different strawmen or strawpeople for the gender fluid millenials.

I'm very familiar with this personally because I had an arrest issued against me by a court because I didn't pay a fine or communicate about it with a lisencing board.  Ok, so that came to me as NAME LASTNAME.  I got my court date screwed up so the same fuckin' court issued me a second warrant but this time as Dr. Name Lastname.  How's that!!!  The same court addresses me two different ways.  (I showed up, squared it all up, and ended it without further problem other than scaring the shit out of my wife).

So, there you go.  You're a corporation.  You can see this in other ways too.

Look on a check.  On the right there is a dotted line... but it's not actually a dotted line.

That MP stands for microprint.  and on if you zoom into that shit it says-

"AUTHORIZED SIGNATURE" over and over again.  It's not dotted.  It's saying you're authorized to act on that account... by why would you need authorization?  Because you're not signing for you!  You're signing for a corporation that has your name and it's "date of birth" aka founding of the company is the same as your birthday.  TADAA.  You're a corporation, well, you're actually a person, but in the states eye you're a corporation.

By the way, so is the state.  You might think the USG is a government.  that's what they say right?  But, it doesn't actually work like that.  They are a government services corporation.  They are listed on Dunn and Bradstreet.  They have corporate IDS.  You can find CANADA listed on the SEC website.  Securities and exchange... why is CANADA on the SEC website?  BECAUSE!!!! It's a CORPORATION.   All of the STATES and COUNTRIES are.  Hooray.  All those times people have said it's as if the government was acting like a corporation... it's because it is one.

Let this sink in for a while.  it's hard to face at first, but more things will start to make sense than not once you see this.
