<p>If you haven't seen the news is a bit here's a shocker. &nbsp;Big pharma is screwing every day people who could otherwise die. &nbsp;That part isn't news. &nbsp;What is news is the most recent chapter. &nbsp;Enter EpiPen.</p>
<p>If you get stung by a bee you're probably going to have an allergic reaction. &nbsp;The most likely approach to handling that is a single dose EpiPen injection followed by some Benedryl. &nbsp;The EpiPen stops the immediate chain reaction that can close your throat keeping you from breathing , but it's effects are short term only. &nbsp;The Benedryl kicks in 30 minutes later and lasts for something like 4-8 hours.</p>
<p>So, what's the scandal? &nbsp;Well, Mylan, the makers of EpiPen have raised prices from $57 for a double shot to $600. &nbsp;I'm in my late 30s and these drugs have been around since I was a kid getting stung by bees. &nbsp;The primary reason that the price is going up is corporate profit. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-08-27/epipen-scandal-worse-you-think-what-you%E2%80%99re-not-being-told">Zerohedge </a>and the <a href="http://theantimedia.org/epipen-scandal-worse/">anti-media</a> just released a great article summing up all the back door deals that Mylan made to kill their competition and use that lack of competition to drive up prices. &nbsp;Then they used the money they made from driving up prices to lobby congress to pass laws forcing places like public schools to keep these EpiPens handy. &nbsp;The Clinton Foundation gets mentioned (and over $100,000). &nbsp;It's worth a read.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>So, what's the alternative to not dying from an allergic reaction because the medicine is too expensive? &nbsp;Buy the generic stuff. &nbsp;A local ABC news channel received a story out of Ft. Hamilton Florida where their Chief Medical Officer explains that you can buy a jar of epinephrine for $5.89 with no insurance required. Add an old Altoids tin and a syringe and you've got yourself an EpiPen-esque kit for $10.</p>

<p>Now the bad news about all of this is the CEO of Mylan, Heather Bresch, &nbsp;that's been doing all this bullshit has gotten herself a $17M raise for her efforts.</p>
<p><img src="https://usuncut.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/mylanmkw.png" width="591" height="389"/></p>
<p>The good news is that Mylan's stock price price has dropped 12.4% as a result of the media (mostly alternative media) driving home this story.</p>
<p>So, do yourself a favor. &nbsp;Share this story. &nbsp;Buy some epinepherine. &nbsp;Buy some popcorn and hopefully we can watch a crooked business go down in flames.</p>
