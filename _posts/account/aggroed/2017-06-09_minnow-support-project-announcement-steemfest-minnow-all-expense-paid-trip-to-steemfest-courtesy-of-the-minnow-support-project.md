As per usual, thank you @elyaque for your badges and support of this page.

This is what a dedicated Witness and amazing supporters can create.  Thank you for your support, contributions, and participation.  If you’d like to contribute directly to allow for an additional participant to go to STEEMFEST please send it to @aggroed with a memo #STEEMFESTMINNOW.  If you do pledge please feel free to mention that in the comments and receive the adoration of the Autobots.  It's a no brainer now hopefully, but all liquid rewards from any #steemfestminnow post will go towards getting the first place person to STEEMFEST and additional monies will pimp out 2nd and 3rd place.

## Love to our backers!  Please feel free to wear the badge<h2>
