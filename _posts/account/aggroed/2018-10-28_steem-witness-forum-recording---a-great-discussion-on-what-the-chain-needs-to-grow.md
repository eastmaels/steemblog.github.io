Please find above the most recent recording of the Steem Witness Panel.  Thank you to @andrarchy, Top 20 Witnesses, and backup Witnesses who joined me on the panel today.  It was a great discussion and I think some good stuff will come out of it regarding how we can grow as a platform.

The first hour or so is a discussion between mostly Aggroed and Andrarchy.  The Rest of it is a conversation that largely focuses around being a developer and building Dapps on the Steem blockchain.
