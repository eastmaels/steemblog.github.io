So a while back I created a mining rig for crypto.  It has 6 GPUs churning out ZEC on the rig and one in my main computer.
Since I started it's been cranking out some steady income.    Most people told me mining was dead but that's not what I'm finding with my setup.  

Despite paying an assload for electricity, $0.19/KW I'm still making money.

The equihash number lies all the time but as you can see I'll make 80 bucks in 7 days.  The machine eats about 1200 watts.  So, it costs me about $38 to run a week.  Add in the fact that I pump it all into steem which has doubled in value I'm doing pretty good.
