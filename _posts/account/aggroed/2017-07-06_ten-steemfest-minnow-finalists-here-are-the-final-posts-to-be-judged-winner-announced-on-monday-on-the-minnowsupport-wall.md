Well, here they are, your finalists, for STEEEMFEST MINNOW.  Please give them a round of applause.  We're at the final stage of this.  One of these minnows is going to STEEMFEST on an all expense paid trip.  Second and Third will get 150 SBD between them. We're down to 11 as @rondonson secured a flight through an @steemfestdreams contest and @nikkig hasn't been seen on the platform for 12-14 days, and no response from @stormriderstudio.

## Judging rules <h2>

1.  Everyone of the invited judges will score the 10 participants.  They will provide me with a number 1-10.  Their first pick gets a 1 and their last pick gets a 10.  I'm going to try to gather 6 or so judges in addition to me.
2.  The audience can vote on who they think should win.  For any contestant you think should go please write their name in a brand new comment.  I'll tally up the number of votes and the person with the most votes will get a score of 1, then 2 and so on.
3.  The budget will play a role.  $500 and under will be scored a 1.  $1000 and under will be scored a 2.  $1500 and under will be scored a 3, and anything over $1500 and over will be scored a 4.

I'll add them all up and then it's golf rules who wins ie the person with the lowest tally comes in first.  If there is a tie the person with the most audience votes will win.

All judging, including audience, is due by 11:59pm New York Time on Sunday night.  

## Judging Thoughts <h2>
It's a fair amount of money to send someone to Steemfest.  I invite the judges to think of it as an investment into a person on behalf of the Steemit and Minnow community.  Which finalist do you think we'll get the most bang for our buck by sending there?

The winners will be announced on Monday on the @minnowsupport wall as the weekly resteem resumes.

Please give it up for the MINNOWS!  They have done a great job and I'm so excited to see how far they've come in such a short time!  NEXT STOP LISBON!
