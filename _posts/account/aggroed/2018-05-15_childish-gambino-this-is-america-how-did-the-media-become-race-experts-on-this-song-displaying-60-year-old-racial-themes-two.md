A few things have been bugging me about this song.  It came on hard into the public presence.  That's always a red flag for me.  It's up to 121M views in 10 days.  That's an extremely viral video.  How did it get there?

## What is the video?

Here's teh video below.  It shows Donald Glover dancing around, murdering people in a warehouse with some rioters, onlookers, death on a pale white horse, some cops, and some other weird references.  I'm betting if I look hard enough I'll see some names actually hidden in graffiti and shit on the sides of the walls near other stuff that gives indicators to what the names will be references too.  We saw this with "I, Pet Goat II" which names 3 major hurricanes that move up the east coast in 2017 before they technically happened.  That was another weird little illuminati promo video.... so I'm betting we can find the same stuff in this.

Ultimately it's a music video.  The cinematography is neat, but the music isn't amazing... I think it's popular because all the Deep State started reporting on it immediately.  Why would that be?   Could it be the Illuminati controls the music media and news media and they collaborate to spread their messaging hidden in these kind of videos?

Well, here's how he dressed to the big awards thing

I mean... that's pretty blatent.

## What bugs me about the racial experts?

Here's the Washington Post coming out two days after this release with a fairly detailed list of racial imagery crackers may have missed.  Somehow WaPo decided to give a shit about hip hop and become racial experts in two days.  Because they're pulling out shit from 1960s etc.  Jim Crow was a big deal, but it was a big deal a long time ago. 
 So, the editors are either 80 and lived through it or more likely 40+ and studied some of this.  But, this isn't rolling stone.  This is WaPo...  what the fuck do they know about hip hop?  They're pointing out civil war pants fashion and some other hundred year old shit (I think this was a diff media outlet that also ran a explaining this is america video).

I think it's much more likely they were handed talking points about the video while promoting it than organically figuring out all the weird racial shit that's in it.  By providing analysis on the video they are also hyping it.

## The question is why?

My first thought goes to distraction.  Why does the media want us focused on a hyper violent song claiming to be America?  What news stories do they not want you reading so you can enjoy some hyperviolence in a music video?  If it's not a distraction why focus on the violence?  Why not portray shit that's empowering to the black community?

This is a little rambly and I know it, but this video triggered me a little into thinking it's a bullshit song being mass promoted by the media to an extent I don't fully understand, but believe that the controlled explosion of this song, combined with his very public illuminati jacket, and the hyper violence suggests it's at least meaningful to the elite and worthy of further scrutiny.  

This is a little ironic of course because I think the song is meant ot play as a distraction, but ultimately if we can figure out the clues that lead to "this is a distraction" and use that logic to identify all the stuff they are distracting us from then that should help the truth community pay attention to the right stuff when the distractions are playing out.
