<p>I'm a dad. &nbsp;I'm a father of two girls. &nbsp;I'm also a Libertarian and spend a lot of time investigating a lot of weird stuff. &nbsp;At the moment I'm really frustrated that I can't find excellent TV content for my kids. &nbsp;I know kids should be outside playing all the time and all that, but the reality for parents is that stuff takes time away from being able to do anything else. &nbsp;I love my kids. &nbsp;I love to spend time with them, but I also need breaks. &nbsp;Turns out the TV is a super cheap babysitter.</p>

<p>So, what I would love to have are some TV shows that I can rally behind and tell my kids "Watch these they are great for you!" &nbsp;Alas, there isn't really anything that fits the bill. &nbsp;Here's a list of shows they like to watch</p>
<p>My Little Pony</p>
<p>Ben and Holly's Little Kingdom</p>
<p>Sophia</p>
<p>Jake and the Neverland Pirates</p>
<p>Peppa Pig</p>
<p>Peg + Cat</p>
<p>Ruby Gloom</p>
<p>Backyardigans</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>MLP has lots of great values in it, but the whole thing revolves around a constant princess theme. &nbsp;Ben and Holly totally creeps me out as the king is a different race than all the elves that he's bossing around. &nbsp;I watch those little elves obeying like good little boys and girls and it's creepy AF. &nbsp;Sophia kinda stars Tim Gunn as the butler who lives out his days working for the king raising his kids. &nbsp;Peppa Pig has a queen that runs the whole land even if she's not a main character.</p>
<p>When they aren't learning about how to be a good princess or fairy (thanks to the Tinkerbell movies) they also like Jake and the Neverland Pirates where they learn that boys are supposed to be pirates. &nbsp;Also, any show that has a boy in it tends to be the star and the girl is simply the supporting role. &nbsp;Yes, there are shows like Dora, but she's not in competition with a boy for the main stage. &nbsp;So, she gets to be the boss.<br>
</p>
<p>There are some good shows like Peg + Cat. &nbsp;It's nice to see a chick doing math. &nbsp;That's cool, but it's really just her, her cat, and some problems that aren't big deals. &nbsp;She's not really dealing with authority at all. &nbsp;She's not participating in a group all that much. &nbsp;So, that show like Ruby Gloom and Backyardigans, both of which I like, are neutral in the face of how a society should run. &nbsp;Actually in the case of Ruby Gloom she lives in some giant mansion and she's the boss. &nbsp;It has some implications that the rich should be running everything.</p>
<p>What I'm looking for is a show that can teach my girls that no one should rule them. &nbsp;They have to make responsible decisions for themselves. &nbsp;Violence as a means of persuasion is wrong, but as a means of self defense is ok. &nbsp;I want it to a coed group so my daughters can learn how to be around boys. &nbsp;I guess I want something of a coed cast away island where the kids make up plans and do cool things to improve the island over time and have discussions over how projects should get going and how labor should be distributed.</p>
<p>Any of you artists wanna make a cartoon that teaches girls they can be leaders and builders and don't have to be a winged fairy princess?</p>
