Normally I write 55 word stories.  I’m not sure how this will go seeing I’ll be at a five word deficit.  This post is a submission to the 50 word challenge.

I heard about the contest through @negativer.  He was an early member of the minnow support project and found a discord home as a mod in the writers block.  I caught wind of this story.  I was of fan of his early as I detected some good wit, but am still feeling extra grateful to him and his wife @morodiene.  They let me crash in their house during the Florida meetup.

Here’s the original post for the contest.  https://steemit.com/fiction/@jayna/fifty-word-short-story-round-up-and-new-prompt

Looks like @jayna has a good contest that could use some more attention.  I hope this helps.

I asked the yoga babe “cost?” 
“$20 plus tax.”

I did yoga but was angry, frustrated, and distracted by fit women.  Fuming or staring at yoga butts.  Good time but I couldn’t relax.  No nirvana for me.

I gave her $20.  She said I need to add change.  She’s right.

Get it!  GET IT!  Like change... you know... money,  but the me in the story knew I needed to change?!?  SEE WHAT I DID THERE?!!!  The double play.  The word play!  The switcheroo.  Kapow!


Good times!
