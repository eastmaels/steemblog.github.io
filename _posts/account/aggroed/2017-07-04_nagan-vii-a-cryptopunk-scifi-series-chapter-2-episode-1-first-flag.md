This is cryptopunk.  It's like steampunk or dieselpunk.  It depicts a different kind of life.  This one is scifi based.  You have the freedom loving people of Nagan VII and the bureaucratic Kartouri who seek to rule them.  

Up until now Tanic, the ships captain of the Karouri Peace Enforcers, has attacked the people of Nagan VII at least twice, he was hit with an illegal quantum slider and sent to a different dimension and had to work his way back over the course of more than a year.  He went back with more ships seeking vengence against Nagan VII and particularly Admiral Santana, but got all blowed up.  He's about to wake up after a concussion in Santana's living room where he's now a guest.

Chapter 2.  First Flag

Tanic woke up and immediately regretted it.  His head was splitting.  He put his hands to his face and felt some bandages and pain.  Seems like he was out on a 3 week straight binger.  Then the swelling and the pulsing in his head.  It hurt.  A lot.  Then he realized he had no idea where he was.  As he looked around it appeared to be a living room, and he was on a fold out couch turned into a bed.  The house was relatively small and as he looked outside he could see some farmland.

He sat up in bed.  He immediately regretted it.  His head felt like a smashed watermelon.  He took a pause to let his brain recalibrate.  There was a techtab on the table with a note from Santana.

>Hey, I hope you're ok, sorry your ships got all blowed up, we're working on fixing them minus the weapons.  It's gonna be a bit.  No one really wants to support the people that just attacked us, but I'll get you home.  In the meantime you can login to libertynet.gov where I've made you the account Kart.Tanic.  It has some script in it too so if you go to town or something you can get what you need.  I don't have any men's clothing since my husband died and I got rid of all his stuff so you're stuck in the uniform for now unless you want a muumuu.  I'm heading into town.  I'll be back with dinner.  Please don't do anything dumb if you wake up before I get back.  

> PS after I created you account I left a very brief post as your introduction <3 Santana.  

He flicked it aside.  Fuck her, I'm gonna strangle her with my bare hands.  

He stood up and felt woozy, but fought through it.  He walked into the kitchen and found a knife and a piece of bread and an apple.  He ate the apple, put the bread in his pocket and walked outside with the knife in his hand.  

Santana lived on a small homestead over an hour outside of Nagnarok.  It was a nice plantation that help a variety of animals and vegetables, rain water collection, and even LENR power.  He could use the tech tab to communicate, but he was sure it was all being watched.  So, he headed down the road looking for someone.  As it turns out he found a group of kids walking his way.

"Hey, Hey you kids.  Come here!"  

The kids saw a half crazed man with a bandage on his head weilding a knife asking for the kids to come over.  They did what sensible kids would do and they ran.  Tanic took two steps to follow them, and immediately regretted it.  He put his hand on his head and sat down from the pain.  A minute or two later he got up and started walking down the road again.  This time a farmer with a few kids got out of an air cruiser (a hover car) and approached him weapon raised.  "I think you were talking to my boys in a most unfriendly way sir?  You ok?"

Tanic saw the gun and knew he had a chance to get a weapon.  So, he put the knife behind is back and walked slowly toward the man saying "Look friend, I'm sorry about your boys,  I was just having a little fun."

The farmer said "Sir, I know you have the knife, please stop.  Put it down and let's talk about how to get you well son."

Tanic ignored him and pressed on "Look sir, I'm just looking for a way into town, I seem to have had a little trouble and now I just need to contact some of my friends and settle all of this."  He took another step and was now pretty close to the farmer so he lunged with the knife, he immediately regretted it.  Before he got anywhere he felt 10k joules shooting through him.  He hit the ground writhing in agony, and passed out.

He woke up some time later with the tech tab on his chest with a note from Santana.  
>I'm in the garden.  Seriously, please don't do anything stupid.  Just log into the tech tab and try not to do anything violent today.  I'll have some food and water for you soon.

He opened up the techtab.  Logged in as Kart.Tanic on libertynet.gov.  Santana's first post for him read-
>Hi, I'm Tanic.  I just attacked your planet.  I'm from the Kartouri.  I'm going to be staying with Santana for a while as my ship is being fixed.  I'll talk to you soon.

Most of the replies were just automatic spambots and welcome bots for a variety of groups.  One or two people said hi.  A few had some insults for having attacked him.  What really bothered him though was that one vote came in red and appeared to be a flag.

>From FarmerMike
>This dude's a dick.  Not only tried to bomb our planet but also threatened my kids with a knife.  What a tool.  Next time don't come at a man with a loaded rifle.  Next time I'll use shots and not volts.  Enjoy your first flag asshole.

Muxxy and Welk were like two little school boys watching the fire works display.  "Operation Excessive Fuckery" worked perfectly.  Santana was pleased too.  They used Netuoso's hacking skills to overwrite the targetting system.  When the Karts made their violent intentions clear they activated the program and took over the targetting system.  In truth only two ships were out there.  Santana in Baby-4 and Mystique sailing the Discordiant.  All the other targets were weapons systems, engine systems, and other critical systems on the the Dreadnaughts.  Neither Mystique or Santana fired a shot.  The peace enforcers blew the shit out of each other.

Now for the rescue operation.  It hadn't been planned this way, but two of the Dreadnaught raider bitches actually shut down life support on one another.  Seems like the Kartouri put their engines a little too close to the circulation systems.  The couple holes they poked in the ships hull maybe led to a few deaths, but if they didn't get over there and patch life support or life boat everyone there was gonna be some blood on their hands.

Sammo?  You ready to launch?

"Maam I'm always ready to launch!"

Sammo, the newly hired ship's engineer released the docking clamps and shot out of the launch bay.  Muxxy, Welk, and Santana along with a skeleton crew flashed across the deep space horizon shooting towards Tanic's "capsized" boat.  Mystique took another team over to the second Dreadnaught to help them.  That looked a little more serious, so they were focusing on being a life boat.  Mystique's ship wasn't much of a transport ship, but the mess deck was big enough to hold a thousand people.  Mystique had also put up additional calls out through spacebird.net.  Should be a few ships coming to help soon.

When they hit the Dreadnaught Sammo got out the Cutters and set to work.  He carved out a healthy section of the hull.  They were ready in spacesuits for it just to be open vacuum, but it seems the ship had automatically shutoff some of the open-to-space sections.  It was cold, but it wasn't dead.  Sammo flicked on his light and could see a few dead engineers and a metal rod that looked like it was shorting a power couple.  "I'll get this done in a giff cap."

About a day later the Kartouri were already settled in about 1400 homes.  Some were concentrated in a few hospitals.  The Kartouri were pretty evenly split between dead and otherwise fine.  Santana took in Tanic himself in her home, a quiet homestead about an hour from Nagnarock by the maglev or even less if you took the underground tubes.  What are presumed to be his wife and kid weren't doing quite as well.  The woman, who Santana couldn't tell was either Margaret or Vanessa and the child were both taken to the hospital.  Some explosion had damaged the babies face and it seemed likely a bioic eye would be necessary.  Apparently a mother's instinct kicked in too and she had shielded the kid.  So, she was suffering from pretty serious burns across her back, but nothing some stem cells couldn't fix.

Tanic was still out cold.  Docs said he was ok and it was just a concussion.  He was now on a couch.  She had bought a tech tab for him.  She wrote out instructions, left the note on the tech tab, and went into town to grab food for two and some clothes.

Going to do 4th of July stuff so comments will be slow.  Anyone that wants to do fan art for this I'd love to see it and will happily post it with attribution so that nearly 3k people can see it.
