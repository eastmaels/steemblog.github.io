Hey all.  We have delegation working on the Steem Smart Contracts test node.  You can find details about it here:  https://github.com/harpagon210/steemsmartcontracts/wiki/Tokens-Contract

## What are we waiting on?

The backend work is done.  We are doing some testing of it. What we need now is a UI, but we keep giving beggars a lot of things to do.  So, we're waiting on that, which is probably a week or two away.  We'll do some testing and then roll this baby out.

More news is incoming.  This is just a notice that we're adding delegations to tokens.  Other notices and features to be shared soon!
