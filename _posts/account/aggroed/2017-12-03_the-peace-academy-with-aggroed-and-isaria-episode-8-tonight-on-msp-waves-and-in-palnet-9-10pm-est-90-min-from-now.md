# <center> The Peace Academy with @aggroed and @isaria </center>


---

The theme this week has been conflict resolution. 

Conflict is unfortunately part of life, but luckily there are methods to resolve disagreements in a peaceful manner. 
We don't always have to agree, but we can approach conflict in a respectful way and work toward a resolution through compromise,  listening, and understanding.

We're planning on play testing some unhealthy attempts at communication and trying to show how they could be worked or approached differently.

***We also want to hear from you!*** 

Be sure to join the audience chat during the show and let us know if you want to come on air with us!
As long as what you have to say is about Peace, Abundance, or Liberty it's fair game!
