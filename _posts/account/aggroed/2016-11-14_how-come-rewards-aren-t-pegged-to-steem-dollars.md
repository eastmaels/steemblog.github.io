<p>Author rewards are a funky thing. &nbsp;When steem is high your post can be worth a shit ton (if the whales deem it good). &nbsp;When steem is low there is basically no way to get any money while blogging. &nbsp;Most people don't take jobs in industries where their pay goes up and down by 2000% over the course of a year. &nbsp;At the moment I have a question, but it may lead to a suggestion momentarily. &nbsp;How come Steem pegs author rewards to steem as opposed to Steem Dollars?</p>
