I have altered my delegated steem power.  I have removed my steem power from @minnowsupport which funds a publicly accessible bot that anyone can use from within the PALnet Discord server.  I have placed it into @msp-lovebot and added a few thousand SP on top.  The @minnowsupport bot is still well north of 120,000 SP.  So, this is a special way to thank and help the little guys who do a lot.

## HF 19 adjustments <h2>

This approach in particular is a consequence of the latest hardfork.  The hardfork was very much designed so it would kill bot voting.  What I will do instead is create additional accounts and delegate to them.  I'll have power on my main account to provide Dank Amps to good posts.  I'll have smurfs to support authors I enjoy and think help this platform and they'll benefit from bot use.

## MSP <h2>

The Minnow Support Project is run by a crew of people who have gone through a variety of steps.  Some just help the bot, others help new people, and some have gone on to create sub communities within PALnet and are working on larger projects such as a steady supply of podcasts from "the (minnow) Pond," poetry contests, writing support, and a steady stream of howtos.
 
You can find a great recent example of being an awesome minnow from @melkay and her #womenofsteemit tag.

She's helping to create a sub community for women with the PALnet Discord server along with fellow Minnow Support Project members to help get women up and running and a supportive team around them.  It doesn't take much digging on the internet to find incredibly abusive people with an extra degree of spite towards women.  It's nice to see a community take shape and offer positive vibes and help.  I'm pumped to support her with a channel she has complete authority over in the PALnet Discord room and hope that her continued leadership helps bring more women to the platform.

## @msp-lovebot <h2>

So, it's hard to argue with supporting good people like that.  So, @msp-lovebot is here to help minnows that are giving back more than just the folks that stop in one time and leave.  For now it's just a little dolphin, but here's hoping over time it grows and really kicks in.

It's likely we're going to hit our 2,000th person to come through the channel by Saturday.  Hopefully you're one of them.  It's pretty vibrant on here.  If you're a minnow and you're not in the channel then I'd argue you're doing Steemit wrong.

Come for the bots.  Stay for the community.
