So... I forgot about the time shift... Tonight's just gonna be a music show.  I'll start broadcasting at 9pm NYC time.  That means tomorrow's Minnow Mayor Town Hall is also gonna start at 9PM and we'll do the 9-11 time slot that I started the show with.

You can listen live in Discord through http://minnowpond.org.  You can also listen live at mspwaves.com/listen


I'm torn between doing some R0n style Dark Country and also some rock from the 90s, maybe even some 80s metal (like GnR).  We'll see.  It's a random show that i'm not prepped for!  

GOOD TIMES!!!
