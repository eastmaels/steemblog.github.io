When I go to a party I'm mostly there to troll new people and see how they do.  I'm constantly looking for funny new friends with a good thick skin to see who could tolerate me for a long enough period to be a long term friend.

I'm old enough now that the parties end up with a range of ages, and that means that some of these new fangled millenials are starting to show up at the party.  The age range of Millennial changes depending on your source.  When it starts and when it ends is pretty up for grabs.  I was born in '79 so the way I like to troll is to use the definition of anyone born in the 80s and beyond is a millenial.  I actually agree with it's probably from the mid 70s is the starting rise up of millenials and that there's really a bell curve effect here rather than a hard stop in the 80s; however, the point while being at a party is not to have an enlightenend conversation, but it's to troll for new friends.  So, there's the setup.

So, I make a few comments about all these young people and one of them takes the bait.  He picks up on the conversation about how old people are.  Now I say something like a grumpy old man about all these damn millennials and he says is epic millennial thought.  "Wait, Millennial is like 1982 and beyond.  It can't be 1980 because I don't think of myself as a millennial."  Above and beyond all the negative sterotypes of basement dwelling hipsters one of the most central themes that I've been playing with in response to the millennial generation is self-identity and assuming one's self-identity.  To me there is nothing more quintessential about being a millennial than claiming you are not one because you don't self-identify with it.

My jokes at the party with my liberal friends are in that "Did you just assume..." vein.  My best friends wife was wondering around with a pearl earring.  She was asking people if it was theirs and skipped me.  So, I say "Wait, did you just assume my ear lobe jewelry status?"  To which she smiled and said "I looked!"  The whole joke is about assuming one's gender, or assuming one's preference of one sort or another and that's because millennials don't let things like genetic makeup get in the way of how they self-perceive.  I find it fascinating and a little bit moronic because defining man and woman should be as simple as XX or XY and yet this generation more than any other has blasted through genital definitions and gone full bore into fluid gender role definitions.  At the same time I find it pretty heroic.  Who the fuck am I or anyone else to tell them how to be, do, act, live, or perceive themselves.  I think some of what they do flies in the face of logic, but honestly it's a movement that's still really young so I'm happy to cut them some slack and they figure out good lines to cross and ones that don't make sense.

Now, later to confirm it I mentioned something about participation trophies.  He shared that his mom was cleaning out his old stuff, handed him a box, and in it were a stack of participation certificates.  So, that's another way that I was winning the argument that he was a millennial.

Ultimately though, my main point here, is that it's the most quintessential thing for a Millennial to share they aren't millennials because they don't self identify as one.  

For the record I self-identify as a gender fluid, previously deceased, vegan, home schooled, fair trade, diety agnostic, selective agoristic libertarian, honorary attorney, veloco-dino born in an indeterminate time between generational stereotypes and would prefer you to reference me using my suggested pronoun "The Late Sergeant" to reference the time when I thought of myself as a great general in the meme wars.
