<p>OK, well, it looks like the big bump from the hardfork got eaten already. &nbsp;Now there's just the matter of 100 accounts with a shit ton of steem. &nbsp;So, what happens next? &nbsp;The price drops. &nbsp;There aren't enough buyers pushing their way into Steem right now to counter the 100M steem that folks want to sell. &nbsp;So, the price will drop. &nbsp;People will power down, and they will sell, and the price will drop. &nbsp;I said it would go to $0.01 in December. &nbsp;Hardfork changed that, but I still see the price heading to that... maybe getting stuck at $0.10/steem through March.</p>
<p>Then what happens? &nbsp;People start buying and people stop selling. &nbsp;Then Steem gets into more hands. &nbsp;Then Steem goes up in value because there are more users and people participating in the economy, but without the 100M steem overhang holding it back.</p>
<p>I bet we end the year 2017 over $1/steem. &nbsp;Probably closer to $2-3. &nbsp;But the whole question is how level is the playing field. &nbsp;If @steemit and all the other employees still have 80% of the steem by March you won't see a bump. &nbsp;Oddly enough them selling on the cheap is the fastest thing to do to propel the price of steem in the long run (assuming we can't go back in time and undo the drastically greedy stake they held onto to start).</p>
