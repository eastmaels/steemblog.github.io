@timcliff posted a neat little writeup of HF19 from his perspective a couple of days ago.  One of the things that I missed was that it's going to take effect immediately.  While the 4x vote power stuff isn't immediate the changes to the reward calc are retroactive for everything in the reward cue.

So, all your shit's about to change.  Mine too.  That's why I wanted a little record of where my wall was before the change happened.  So, here's a 5 min video that shows some of my posts, their value and some degree of whale balls that uplifted them.  We'll see what the new value is soon.

Then we'll also see what happens when the first King post goes live.  I'm betting it touches 10k.  The logic that the shrunk incentive will shrink the boosting is countered by the fact that the shrunk incentive makes it more imporant to get a bot and keep your few big votes on the handful of mega posters that are gonna moon.  We'll see.

I'm going to bed.  We'll see what craziness or calm exists tomorrow.
