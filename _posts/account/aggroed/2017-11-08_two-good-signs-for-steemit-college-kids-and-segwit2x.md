OK, quick story.  I'm technically at work, but I have to bust this story out.  I was walking by some college kids who were waiting for lab.  The story goes something like 

"Man it was $0.08 back a few years ago.  Now it's seven grand.  If I invested a 1,000 back then I'd be a millionaire right now. 
 I didn't even know about it...  I wish I could have invested in it."

I walk away from this for a second, and then come back and say "sorry to interupt here's the thing.  BTC isn't the only crypto out there.  Have you heard of Steemit?  No?  Ok, well it's a crypto currency similar to BTC and you can exchange pretty easily for others, but you can also post stories and earn rewards doing it.  You're a college kid.  Just type up your notes from class and put it in an article and you'll start making money."

I got a bunch of "hey thanks mister" from these random millenials.  To be honest I was nervous that I wasn't in a furry costume nor did I have gifts of MDMA for them.  I thought they may not accept me as I am, but they were kind.  So, hopefully I will continue to introduce our lord and savior blockchain while wandering around campus.

The main point though is that BTC is mainstreem.  It's at the water cooler in colleges.  Kids are thinking this is a future space for them.  Just hang on to your investments cause I don't think it matters financially what you pick cause the crypto space is gonna get a ton of money poured in.

## segwit2x <h2>

@scaredycatguide dropped by the Deepend in PALnet.  He just wanted to make sure everyone knew that that SEGWIT2x had been cancelled.  They're apparently worried about making 8 million btc clones and diluting their value... If only they had a platform that could go through 19 HARDforks (not just softforks) without splitting the chain 19 ways.  If only there was something like that out in the world... and if only they had a neon green logo of chatboxes in a provocative sexual position...

Anyway, I'm no finanical expert, but I think Steemit and the other alts have been oversold for a while as people poured into btc hoping to get their next shit-btc-coin.  Now it's cancelled... so, my thought is folks are going to cash out what they made and it's probably gonna dump into some alt coins that are on sale right now.  This isn't financial advice, but I'm sharing that I'm not powering down or selling Steem right now.
