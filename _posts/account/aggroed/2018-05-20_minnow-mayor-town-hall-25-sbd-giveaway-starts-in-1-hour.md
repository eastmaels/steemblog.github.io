Hey folks.  It's sunday.  That means it's time for the Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  It's 5/20/18.  It's a beautiful night here in New England.  It's time to talk to some friends on the air.

I'm hoping that next week I'll be having a good conversation with Jordan Sather of Destroying the Illusion.  I've been chatting with him on Facebook.  This week though I didn't line anyone up.  I'm also exhausted.   I had a bachelor party today and we did Archery Tag.  Tons of fun and I highly recommend it.  Shooting your friends in the face with a bow and arrow is surprisingly fun.

Anyway, I'm gonna call it a two hour show tonight and stick to that.  I think I'll do a little news segment on price, talk some about Minnow Support and what we're working on.  Then we'll move on and invite audience members.

## Coming on air

Just make sure the sounds of the show aren't feeding directly into your mic or the feedback is terrible.  mic and headset are strongly suggested.

## Show Logistics 

Just hop into [The Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network](minnowpond.org) and we'll get you sorted out.

## Giveaway- 

We play a heavily loaded game called Dice Bitches.  I roll, you roll.  If you tie or beat my roll you move onto the next round.  Last one standing wins.

If I win once we play again.  If I win twice we'll find a good charity to support.
