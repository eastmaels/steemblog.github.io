<p>If you haven't heard of the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasteading">Seasteading </a>you're missing out. &nbsp;It's the idea that we can collectively start a country in the sea. &nbsp;If you haven't noticed all the land around here has been claimed by <a href="https://www.countries-ofthe-world.com/all-countries.html">197 </a>governments. &nbsp;They have not proven very friendly when people start declaring their sovereignty. &nbsp;That means 197 governments monopolize the control of 7 billion people. &nbsp;That ratio seems very off to me and seems to allow an unusually large amount of malfeasance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://www.damninteresting.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/11/sealand.jpg" width="284" height="221"/></p>
<p>Anyway, a while back I remember reading about this country that this guy had formed in the sea. &nbsp;It's called <a href="http://www.sealandgov.org/about">Sealand</a>. &nbsp;He took over an abandoned platform created by the Brits in WWII and declared it a country. &nbsp;He was dragged into court about it, and the court ruled they had no jurisdiction. &nbsp;He created a country and it was de facto recognized by the most (possibly 2nd most) imperialistic nation on the planet.</p>
<p>So, then I got to thinking about the <a href="http://www.seasteading.org/">Seasteading Institute</a>. &nbsp;Their plan is to build a giant &nbsp;floating city from scratch and dangle it in coastal waters of a friendly nation that's willing to make them mostly autonomous sorta like a floating Hong Kong. &nbsp;That's all well and good, but everyone knows that it's significantly cheaper to buy something used than to buy something brand new. &nbsp;I also don't want to rely on the kindness of people that tend to be murderous psychopaths (aka politicians).</p>
<p>So, I started looking at container ships. &nbsp;They are big, but you'd have to retrofit the hell out of them. &nbsp;Then I stumbled on this gem of an <a href="http://www.cruisemapper.com/wiki/1007-how-to-buy-a-cruise-ship">article</a> that talks about buying cruise ships. &nbsp;I stopped looking at the container ships that would need serious overhauling and started looking at some sweet used cruise ships. &nbsp;I mean they are built for lots of people. &nbsp;There are also floating hotels, but they don't seem like they would do ok 12-200 miles off shore.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>So, here's what I'm currently thinking is best.</p>
<p><img src="https://s13.postimg.org/h9gs7mhc7/ship.jpg" width="935" height="604"/></p>
<p>It looks like this!</p>

<p>So, the thing costs $4.5Million. &nbsp;But it has 356 passenger cabins. &nbsp;That's $12362/cabin. &nbsp;Some cabins are smaller and some are larger so the price will likely vary from a minimum of $10k-15k relative to the investment in the ship. &nbsp;You can also track it by person, which is $900 or $5000/person. &nbsp;The rooms are a little cramped, but the life can be pretty good cruise ship.</p>
<p>How would the thing work? &nbsp;Well, you draft a proposed constitution and declaration of independence. &nbsp;You crowd source or get bank financing. &nbsp;You give citizenship to everyone that owns a room or bed. &nbsp;You can issue your own currency that can be spent on the boat or traded. &nbsp;You allow people more freedom than they'd experience anywhere else. &nbsp;You could also issue money to pay people that work on the boat. &nbsp;The people on the boat could rent out rooms, sell services, or sell goods in order to buy food and supplies not provided by the boat itself. &nbsp;If you're allowing more freedom you can do things like run a casino that people wouldn't otherwise be allowed to do in their home country. &nbsp;I would think tourism could be a big hit and since the thing is already setup as an entertainment vessel it's likely it could be a go to destination whenever it docks.</p>
<p>You could slap some <a href="www.backyardquaponics.com">aquaponics </a>in there to help grow food on the ship. &nbsp;Before you know it you have a country, a currency, a good starting point, and many people can enjoy either a pleasant retirement, a good cruise, or figure out how to raise a family. &nbsp;The boat I'm showing there has a family room and crew quarters that could be used for teachers etc. &nbsp;Maybe we could start something on it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Do you have $12k as a starting point for a room and citizenship in a floating country? &nbsp;Would you trade currency issued to you, digital or print, by the government of your floating ship? &nbsp;Wanna buy a country/cruise ship with me?</p>
