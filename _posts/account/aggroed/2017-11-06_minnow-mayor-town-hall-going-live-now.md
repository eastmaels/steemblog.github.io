With the hour change for EST but not for UTC looks like i'm going on at 8pm tonight!!!!

So, here's the deal.  The show is still a town hall format.  Come in and get in line to talk to me.  Everyone can have 5 minutes to chat about whatever they want.  I would encourage you to promote stuff, introduce yourself, or ask questions.  I'll do my best to answer them.

There is going to be a delegation contest for 250 SP tonight.  Anyone that comes on the show with me is eligible to win it.  The delegation comes off after 6 months or after you hit 5000 SP.  If you're already a dolphin or whale you can still win but you have to put it on someone else of your choice.

We'll play Dice Bitches too.  25SBD up for grabs.
