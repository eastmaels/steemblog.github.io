For people in the truth movement the world appears to be run by immoral banksters that are willing to cause immeasurable harm in exchange for greater control of the planet.  We see massive corruption, human trafficking, drug trade, violence, crooked banks, politicians, and organizations all over the place.  It's a dark time and it's hard to figure out where this behavior originates and so we're taking a look back through organizations thought to have a major influence in today's society and see what we can discover.

## Deep State Mapping Project

The founder of the project is a gentleman by the name of Dylan Louis Monroe.  I found him through facebook attached to another Steemian and Truther I like of @jaysather.  Dylan created a map of many key points, topics of interest, and events of the alternate history truthers are putting together.  He calls this the Deep State Mapping Project and it has at times been referred to as the Q-Map in reference to the alleged military insider Q who posts on 4chan and 8chan about the deep state.

You can find Dylan's website here: https://deepstatemappingproject.com/
He has a personal site here: https://www.dylanlouismonroe.com/q-web.html

He has a 2 page PDF of the Deep State map with a handy reference on how to read it here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paXXtcNVGFm13fbIr1TE9oXlRqovviET/view


Here's a color coded high resolution version of his map.

## The discussion

This conversation wanders through some ancient history and how it may play out in modern society.  I recently saw this clip 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-VoCCp-zUg

In it you can see Will Ferrall holding a mock satanic ritual complete with an unholy rebirth.  You can find more information about that [here](https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2018/04/11/will-ferrell-performs-satanic-ritual-on-live-tv/comment-page-1/), but honestly I've been struck by just how blatant and in your face the symbolism is recently on TV and movies and so we're try to figure out where did this occult shit come from!


## Going back

Dylan and I both try to piece together what we've learned in school, what we've searched for, and connections that seem relevant to today to try to assemble some narrative that might describe how we got here even if it conflicts with some elements of traditional versions of history.

This conversation focused on the Hyksos, a priest class out of Egypt that left Egypt, settled into Israel, and may have ties to the Khazars.  A more indepth history of the Khazars can be found [https://stillnessinthestorm.com/2015/03/the-hidden-history-of-incredibly-evi/].  The khazars worship BA'AL which may actually be a reference going back to the Hyksos who worshipped an earlier version called SET.  

We note standard historians discuss "Court Jews" as financial position within many monarchies where a Jewish person is in charge of court finance and sometimes held responsible in case the monarch dies while in debt.  It seems that one Court Jew family in particular who may have a bloodline to the Khazars is the Rothschild family who took prominence in the early 1800s and eventually earned the title of "Guardian of the Papel Treasure."  There is also some evidence that the Rothschild's are actually serving at the behest of the Jesuits, who are a bit like the CIA of the Catholics.

You can see some of the history that's important in this abbreviated timeline

So for an exceptionally abbreviated timeline

Ancient Egypt
SET Worship
Kicked out the Set worshipping Hyksos
Settle in Jerusalem 
Potentially merge with the Khazars
Khazars under duress convert to Judaism 
Khazar court Jew, Rothschild, becomes prominent banker
Through Waterloo becomes exceptionally wealthy
Becomes the Guardian of the Papal Treasure

And maybe that's how we tie ancient Egypt to the current Vatican

This is certainly the beginning of a conversation and less of a known certainty.  People that have studied this for a long time and have knowledge that seems relevant with citations would be welcome to add to the discussion.  You can find me at minnowpond.org as Aggroed.
