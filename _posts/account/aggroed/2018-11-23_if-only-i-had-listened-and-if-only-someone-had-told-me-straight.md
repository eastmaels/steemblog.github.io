Last year at the high inertia said  to me”we are in a bubble.”  I thought “no, this is the new way!” One of us was right and my net worth dropped.  I’ve been kicking myself for a year.  So, I don’t want that to happen to me again, and I want to be a guy that says “hey don’t miss out on this.”

# don’t miss out on this

There is blood in the streets.  Crypto is going through stages of capitulation.  It is possible we will see lower prices over the next few weeks and months, but the recovery can also take place soon.  It’s impossible to tell.

What’s not impossible to tell is that crypto is going to have another all time high.  We aren’t dead.  We are reloading.  This is roughly the eighth cycle of this.

On that front SteemFest was filled with multiple days of developers talking about what they are building here.  Smts are coming.  People will launch thousands of them.  Few will make it to anything but those that do will horde some Steem and drive prices up.  Instutional money has been setting up for this moment, and when we go back up it’s gonna be with Goldman Sachs money in there.  The future of crypto and the future of Steem are healthy.

# what to do?

Stop spending money on useless shit.  Invest in crypto.  Buy Steem.

You can earn here through the distribution tools, and while it’s not always a ton, it’s easier when you have some steem and stake if your own.  You can build here and work with others to program, market, sell, or creatively inspire projects.  

Take money you’re going to otherwise waste on some useless holiday shit you won’t care abou a month from now and start putting some money into Steem every day or every week.

# what not to do

Don’t take everything you have and dump it all in at once.  There is a chance we are at bottom.  There is a chance we are not.  Try to make a few extra bucks or save them and put that into Steem OVER TIME.

# a year from now

I think crypto will be up and Steem will be doing great.  Maybe it’s two years, but I don’t think it will take that long.  There’s another all time high coming, and in order to make a shit ton of money on it we have to invest now and be patient.  

So, I’ve said it.  I will keep saying it.  Steem under a dollar is fucking steal.  Steem under 50 cents is insane.  We are in the zone where you are likely going to find the single best entry point for the next year.  Don’t miss it.

# is this financial advice

I don’t know you, and I don’t know what you can afford to spend.  This is general investing advice, but I can’t know the specifics of what is right for you and your family.  Don’t put money in you will need out in the short term.  Do your own due diligence and make smart choices using this as just part of it.

Lastly, Steem monsters have held up exceptionally well.  Consider them as they have slightly less risk but I also don’t know if they have the same upside yet.
