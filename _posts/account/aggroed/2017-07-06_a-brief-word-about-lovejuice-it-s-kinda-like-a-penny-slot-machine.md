Let's talk a little more about how a bitbot works so that you guys are spending the correct amount of money and getting more money back than what you put in.

The max post reward every 36 min is 80 cents.  That's based on USDs. 

The minimum bid is 0.01SBD.  For the purpose of this, let's assume that an SBD is worth 2 cents.

Ok, so, here's what happens you're betting 2 cents and hoping to win 80 cents.  If you get this you win 40x your bid/bet!  That's pretty awesome!!!  You shouldn't bid more than 80 cents because it's a losing bid every time (unless you want to support this little bot or other minnows who use it).

## Easy split pot example <h2>

If someone else comes along and bids 2 cents as well, then you're going to split the pot and each of you will get 40 cents in post rewards.  That's 20x your return.  That's still pretty crazy!

## uneven split bids <h2>
You bid a little and they bid a lot.

Let's say they bid .18 sbd and you bid 0.02.  The pot will be split so that bigboy gets 90% of the rewards and you only get 10% of the rewards.  So, with 0.18sbd they will get 70ish cents.  You'll get sevenish.  Still a return, but you can see as more people are bidding or some people are putting in bigger bets it's not as good of a deal.

## Perfect timing <h2>
The perfect time to bid is when no one else has bid anything.  Drop 0.01SBD and you'll get 70-80 cents back.  That's perfect.  Maybe put in a friend's URL instead of your own :)

## Bad timing <h2>
Check the wallet.  If you see a lot of people putting in small bids.  Or one guy putting in a large bid then don't bid then.  You might not get a return.

## Terrible/friendly bids <h2>
The max reward is 80 cents.  Don't bid on anything near 0.5 SBD or more because after that there isn't enough pot rewards from this to pay for your bet/bid.  So, if you bid higher than 0.5SBD you either like me/this bot and want it to help other minnows or you don't understand math and have made a bad judgement call.

## It's meant to be fun and helpful <h2>
Keep your bids small.  Check the wallet on lovejuice to see if anyone else is bidding.  You may want to wait a bit and come back.  But about 50 times a day you can put in 0.01SBD and get 70-80 cents back.

## Be friendly <h2>
Want to make a friend?  This is a pretty simple way beyond just upvoting their post to perform a nice gesture for someone else.  It doesn't cost more than a penny and it's  thoughtful.  Consider putting the vote on another person.  I mean with HF19 you only get so many upvotes a day before power drains.  Here's a way you can put an 80cent vote on something without using one of your minnow votes, make a friend, and help other minnows by supporting this bot.  The bot will leave a comment saying the vote came from you, so they'll know if they check their replies.

You might catch a follower.  You might make a friend.  You could get resteems.  You could catch upvotes.  You may find your posts get some friendly lovejuice too.  This platform amplifies kindness.  My guess is that if you start using this on other people it'll get repaid many times over.

## how to bid <h2>
Send a transfer of 0.01sbd or more to @lovejuice.  In the memo copy/paste the post url you are interested in using.  Do, a few for your own posts, but again I suggest doing it as a gift to others to make friends and be a nice person.
