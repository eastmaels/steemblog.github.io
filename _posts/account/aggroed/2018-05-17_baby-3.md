So, this little buddy is about 5cm long.  We don't know if it's a boy or girl yet.  We'll be able to peer at it's genitals in a few more weeks (I bet they're embarrassed already).  The baby is due in November.  So far everything looks healthy and well.  I had been hoping for twins, but alas for me and relief for muh wife.

We got a while before this little buddy pops out, but I'm thrilled to bring into the world another future Steemian.

<3,

Aggroed
