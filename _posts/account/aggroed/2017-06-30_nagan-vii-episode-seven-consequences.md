I'm terming this brand of fiction cryptopunk.  It's like diesel punk or steampunk, but it's based on a libertarian crypto society.  This one happens to be science fiction.  So, call it sci-fi cryptopunk if you want.  Anyway, Santana is about to kick ass.  Let's watch.

## Episode 7- Consequences <h2>

Tanic put down his new son Tanic Jr.  A blobby smily sort of child.  His eyes would wander around the room with curiosity.  Venessa, the mother, was on the bed.  It was awkward telling Margaret about what happened.  To her he had left for a minor mission, but for him it was 2-years and unclear if he'd ever return.  Vanessa provided relief and a chance for a life, but now that he was back in his original universe it was difficult to explain.  It was mostly going back and forth on calls with endless sobbing.  He loved her dearly, but he hoped she would understand that it wasn't intentional infidelity.  What happens in other time lines and dimensions stays in them... except for children.

He tickled Tanic Jr one more time and went to the bridge.

 Tanic Elotaw allowed himself a smirk as his newly retrofitted Dreadnaught class Peace Enforcer exited Quantum slip outside of Nagan VII accompanied by two additional Peace Enforcers 141007 and 154022.  His weapons were ready.  Margaret hadn't snapped at him in a few hours, and Nagan VII was about to be bombarded to pieces.  He tugged his uniform tight and started his broadcast.

"People of Nagan VII.  Your insurrection against the Kartouri Civilization is at an end.  Unless you issue uncondional surrender and agree to annexation by writ of Councilor Mago your civilization will be nuetrali..."

The broadcast cut out unexpectedly.  The screen went blank, and after a brief disruption it flickered and his nemesis "Admiral" Santana appeared. 

"Tanic, I'm sorry to see you again.  We have prepared for your arrival and will unroll the welcome mat if you don't leave immediately.  Head back to your Kartouri shithole either in peace or pieces.  The option is yours."

Tanic laughed.  "Santana, you may not know this but I've been waiting two years for this opportunity.  I've come with friends and the latest technology available to Kartouri.  We hereby suggest you power down, lay down your arms and prepare to be boarded.  We have no intention of leaving without annexati.."  again the screen cut out.  There was a brief high pitched squeel, and then a hard hitting bass rythm starting pounding at rediculous levels on the bridge.  This was followed by a hard hitting drum solo on top of it."  He plugged his ears.  

His new weapons officer Digs started shouting, but it was broken up by the noise.  "Com... de.r.  There.. bogie.... 360.."  Tanic looked at the tactical display and saw several hundreds blips appear.  He also saw "operation excessive fuckery" on the screen.  "Give me a visual" he shouted, but Digs indicated he couldn't hear.  

The next second he was on the ground.  He looked at the HUD and saw 3 deck floors flashing yellow and apparently depressurizing.  He ran to the window and saw a flurry of torpedoes hitting his ship.  He knocked the ensign out of his chair and steered the ship towards the bogie, but his dreadnaught didn't respond.  The engines were powering down, and even life support was turned off.  He went back to the window and saw the other two peace enforcers were dark, and then his lights went off.  All that was left was functional was the deafening sound of the viking crypto metal band Fyrce pouding in the speakers.  A blast went off on the bridge knocking him down and unconscious.  

It was the last sound he heard as Santana's small fleet picked apart his ships apart.

## Episode 6 unintentionally skipped :) <h2>


## Episode 5-  Back on track <h2>

Santana's eyes opened to meet the hot deathly bright lights of an engulfing inferno.  In truth it was just morning after a pity-party rager, but when the sun came into her room and her eyes opened it burned.  

The last few hours haven't been great sleep by any means.  Puking up 2 bottles of gin and and wiping up leftover vomit with tear soaked shirts isn't cool, but you gotta purge.  Those fucking Karts killed Heather.  They've been flying together since they were kids.  Heather used to bully Santana.  She'd knock her icecream off the cone.  She put glitterbugs in her lunches, but by high school they were close friends, and after college they started patrolling together.  15 years flying together.  You face death.  You save lives.  You really get to know someone and their courage.  

It's not vengence.  We have a right to live as we please without some empire staking a claim here.  We have a right to peace, abudance, and liberty.  We have a right to live in our own right in our own way.  That said.  This one's about vengence too.

Nagan VII News Network braodcasted out footage of the Kart ship popping back in after the slider.  Looked pretty different.  Guess it's been out there a while.  teehee.  Looked ragged as shit.  So, it's probably going back for repairs at the military base, which means she has to get her ship and a group of Nagan fuckery experts together.

She got up, washed her face, and quickly changed.  She grabbed her tech tab, turned the display brightness down low, and took a peek.

Her post hit 14 Trillion liberty scripts.  Looks like brother Johal hooked it up along with whizkid.  She made a note to drop thank you notes. 


 Santana checked her messages.  Muxxy and Welk both bit her up.  Looks like two great shipmates to have on board.  She put in a call to MK down at the shipyard.  Yes they have a ship, yes it's expensive, yes it has the latest shield technology, yes it can jam Kart fuckers with some epic Viking Heavy Crypto Metal.  12T scripts?  Sold.  That's a few extra for some extra crew.  

She pulled up fleetlist.net.  Put out a contract for an engineer and a ship weapons expert.  She won't have a lot of time, but it should be enough to get her bird in the air and a little flying under her belt.

Time to call Mystique and see if she's got her bird ready for a fight too.  Fuckery is'a brewin'.
