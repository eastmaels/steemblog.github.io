The witness boxes are locked and loaded.  Unless something drastic happens between now and tomorrow HF20 is getting implemented at 11est tomorrow.  So, in just over 24 hours this chain kicks into Velocity.

# What's in Velocity?

1.  We're changing bandwidth to resource credits.  It should be a more efficient system.  Hopefully after it equilibrates you don't notice much of a difference.

2.  Account Creation.  If the tokens are available then it's free.  If it's not you can still create with 3 steem, but you can no longer delegate to create.

3.  15 minute timer on curation and self voting benefits reduced.  If you self vote you will stop getting loaded up with benefits for having done so.  There's a 15 min wait before getting full curation rewards rather than 30.  Also, downvotes and upvotes are allowed in the last 12 hours, but they get a lot more expensive.

# Anything I should do?

If you have a major announcement that needs to go out consider if you want it before or after HF20.
If you have money on exchanges consider if you want to pull it out 
Assume that tomorrow will have some disruption in service.  Hopefully nothing really seems to happen, but on the off chance things go wrong try to prep yourself ahead of time

# What's exciting about HF20?

It's not front end wow.  It's back end changes.  So, to the average user it won't look like much, but this sets us up for expansion in the user base without a decrease in user experience.

I happen to believe strongly that people are the value of this blockchain and having more of them using, trading, and hodling our blockchain tokens are what will make the value rise and all of us moon.  So, I'm super stoked for this.  SMTs and Communities are likely a lot flashier, but this is the base for all of it.

## Congrats to all and here's hoping for a smooth day

If all goes according to plan you won't notice much, but we'll be set to grow.  Hoping there isn't any interruption in service, but you should be prepared in case there is.  It's taken a ton of work by some exceptionally talented Steemit guys, community members, and Witnesses.  Three cheers for all, and may the Eternal Blockchain upvote us all tomorrow.
