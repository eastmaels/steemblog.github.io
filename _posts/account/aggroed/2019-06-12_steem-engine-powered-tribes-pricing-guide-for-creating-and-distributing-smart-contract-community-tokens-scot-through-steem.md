The following post outlines the pricing model for steem-engine going forward.  There are fees to setup scotbot and the various instances that makeup a tribe.  We discuss here the pricing options now and give notice to some changes in the future.

**Steem**: a delegated proof of stake blockchain
**steemit**: a company that created and continues to work on the steem blockchain
**steemit.com**: a portal to view information posted to the steem blockchain
**Steem Smart Contract Platform**: this is a node that reads custom json published on the blockchain and executes contracts based on opensource and publicly available code.  It utilizes the steem database as a public and distributed leger that records all the transaction data.
**steem-engine.com**: A UI that interacts with the Steem Smart Contract node and displays information.  It additionally provides services that rely on the public and opensource node.
**Scot**: a smart contract organizational token, it's a synonym for token/coin, but specific to coins/tokens on the steem-engine.com platform
**Scotbot**: a closed source Scot distribution tool.  It has 3 separate rewards pools it can use to distribute Scot: proof of brain, delegated proof of stake mining, and staking.
**Nitrous**: a custom website that displays post rewards for a particular Scot.  It's similar to steemit.com because it was originally built on `condenser`, which is the program that powers steemit.com, but it's been highly tailored to specific scot instances.
**ScotTube**: a custom website that displays post rewards for a particular scot based on video content.  It is a fork of of of D.Tube.
**ScotBB**:  A custom forum that displays post rewards in a particular Scot.  It is a scot powered instance of TokenBB.
**Tribe**: A website with multiple instances connected to it for example: a blog, a forum, and a video service.  

# SETUP Pricing 

Setup cost per inflation pool: 1000 ENG
Proof of Brain, Mining and Staking are 3 separate inflation pools.

Changing settings = 100 ENG burned

Instances cost 1000 ENG to setup

Nitrous, ScotTube, and ScotBB are "instances." An instance is a website designed to show the information on the blockchain in a user friendly way.  Each instance will cost 1000 ENG to setup.  It includes setting up to your custom URL and minor modifications to the server.

Other instances brought into Steem-Engine will likely follow similar pricing.

## Ongoing Pricing

There are no monthly charges associated with Scotbot or the instances.  Instead Scotbot and Instances require owners to stake ENG in order for the distribution mechanism/program to work.

**Inflation Pools**
Cost per inflation pool = 1 staked ENG per active user

**Instances**

Cost for Nitrous = 1 staked ENG per active user
Cost for Scot.tube = 1 staked ENG per active user
Cost for Scot.bb = 1 staked ENG per active user (TokenBB also requires users of scot to enroll in either a [Gold or Platinum plan](https://shop.buildteam.io/product-category/tokenbb/))
By choosing to use a lot of services managed by steem-engine a  community account will need a lot of staked ENG and have moderate startup costs, but no ongoing charges will be made by steem-engine.

active user = account with staked scot

If a user would like to use their own custom interface that can be allowed.  We charge 2 staked ENG per active user.

If you have created a tool that can display post rewards and think you'd be a good fit for working with us to launch your custom instance please contact aggroed in Discord.

For tribes that have more than 10,000 staked users we can  reduce the amount of staked ENG per active user.

## EOS token listings

1000 ENG to get your token listed on the exchange either as a Steem Engine native token being ported to EOS or as an EOS token being ported to Steem-Engine.

A similar cost will exist for other tokens on other blockchains to get listed.  The issuer of the token isn't necessarily the one who must pay the fee.

These costs fluctuate and may change due to market condititions.

# Future pricing considerations

**Listing and Premium listing**
In the coming months as more coins appear on steem-engine we'll likely have a couple ways to chop up the number of coins visible on the screen at once.  If you'd like to be higher up it'll be based on the amount of ENG that's staked.  We may implement minimum staked ENG amounts to be listed for sale on the site.

**Advertising**
If you're interseted in getting additional eyeballs on your token we're happy to offer advertising on the site.  Contact us and we can figure out an appropriate cost for what you have in mind.

**Unstaking Burn**
In the coming months we plan to introduce a 1 ENG fee to unstake through the steem-engine.com website.
