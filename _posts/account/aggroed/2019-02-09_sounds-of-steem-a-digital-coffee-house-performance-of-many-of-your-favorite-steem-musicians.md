Today is another fun Steem day for me.  I get to cohost the Sounds of Steem digital concernt.  Come listen to your favorite Steem musicians perform live!  We're starting at 4pm EST (2100 UTC).  We'll be live in msp-waves.  You can listen in [PALnet](http://minnowpond.org) or online at mspwaves.com/listen

I also have 2 tournaments running today.  One after the Sounds of Steem at 4pm for 500 Steem, and one at 8pm tonight for a whole bunch of the legendary summoners.
