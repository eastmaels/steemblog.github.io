#  The Non-Aggression Principle // Part 1

The goal of the Peace Academy is to find ways to bring Peace, Abundance, and Liberty into our lives and our communities.  Nearly all aspects of state don't teach these principles.  So, not only do we have  to learn to walk a different path, but we're challenged to unlearn what we're encountering as well.

One of the places to start so that we can do that is by exploring the concept of the ***Non-Aggression Principle***.

The basic idea of the ***Non-Aggression Principle (NAP)*** is individual freedom combined with personal responsibility.
***NAP*** uses a moral and ethical compass that helps us to live in peace and liberty.
The idea is that all individuals are free to live as they want as long as they cause no harm or threat of harm to another individual or their property.
This naturally includes rules against murder, rape, and theft.
It also includes rules against involuntary servitude such as taxation.
For me this stems from a spiritual and philosophic space.  We're all fractals of the same eternal essence.  We're all woven together.  Harm done to another is harm done to ourselves.  Separation consciousness makes that difficult to see, but it doesn't change that causing other harm does harm to us.

***NAP*** employs the basic motto of
*"Do no harm, but take no shit"*
Defending oneself against acts of aggression is completely acceptable, unless innocent people would be harmed in the process.

The ***Non-Aggression Principle*** views Governments that use violence or the threat of force while falsely claiming to protect individual rights as completely unnecessary and against the principles of peace and liberty.

Instead, the free exchange of goods and services as well as individual rights and freedoms are seen as a natural result of applying ***Non-Aggression Principle***.
