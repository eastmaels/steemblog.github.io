<p>I've written about Harambe <a href="https://steemit.com/harambe/@aggroed/dicks-out-for-harambe-a-modern-revival-of-post-wwi-dadaism">before</a>. &nbsp;He means the world to me. &nbsp;He's such a classic tragedy figure. &nbsp;I honestly think he brings back post WWI protest art known as Dadaism. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, UT Austin students have been holding a protest against concealed carry licensees on campus. &nbsp;They don't want guns. &nbsp;Apparently they haven't been paying attention to what happens to people in gun free zones or listened the gays post Pulse that get "armed gays don't get bashed."</p>
<p>How better can I troll the Austin anti-gun crowd and immortalize Harambe at the same time? &nbsp;I don't know. &nbsp;I don't think I'll ever top this.</p>
<p>With Love,</p>
