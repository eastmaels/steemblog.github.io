<p>To date I've put together a total of 14 videos and I've put them on youtube. &nbsp;Today they had a hit total that continues to increase throughout the day- <del>126,296</del> <del>130,476 (2:30pm)</del> <del>136,341 (4:22) 139,201 (5:51) 143,123 (6:45)</del>, <del>147,714 (9:03)</del>, <del>156,563 (10:16)</del> <del>162,674 (12:53am, final count for 13 days),</del> <del>213,281 (11:00am 9/20/16)</del> &nbsp;221,891 (3:45 9/20)hits. &nbsp;The first video went up September 6th. &nbsp;The most recent was last night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Making these videos was a very small time investment compared to writing the blog posts themselves. &nbsp;The blog posts take several hours to compile all the relevant pictures and stories that I want to cover. The videos themselves are typically 5-20 minutes just talking over what I already wrote. &nbsp;Because I've already done the research and know the material I can talk pretty off the cuff about what I wrote about. &nbsp;Most important the audience doesn't seem to mind. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing it does is provide a reference page for the article. &nbsp;News today doesn't have much that it falls back on for it's opinions or analysis. &nbsp;It's hard to judge where the story came from, who wrote it, and what the purpose is. &nbsp;Having both details, analysis, and the references allow people to verify a thesis statement for themselves based on what you found. &nbsp;So, far it's been pretty popular. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't think that what I was doing would take off any where near this quickly, but so far it has. &nbsp;I think it's a combination of talking about things are interesting, providing a perspective and analysis on the work that was done, and trying to be respectful while interacting with the audience have all helped.</p>
<p>Creating the videos couldn't possibly be easier. &nbsp;I bought a $100 USB <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=blue%20yeti%20microphone">Blue Yeti</a> Microphone from best buy.</p>

<p>Then I purchased a 2 year <a href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/home">license </a>to Screen Cast-O-Matic for $30.</p>

<p>I plugged in the mic to a USB port, opened the Screen Casting software and hit record and then I started talking over my blog post. &nbsp;I wouldn't read line for line, but I'd discuss in a less formal way the things that were on the blog. &nbsp;I'd go to each picture. &nbsp;If I included links I'd do that too.</p>
<p>When the recording was done I'd hit save and choose the .flv extension since that's what youtube wants to use anyway. &nbsp;I'd upload to youtube, and then I spread around to a few friends and pages on facebook to get it started. &nbsp;I was talking about things that those pages and people liked and they were happy to share.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What am I going to do with a small and growing youtube audience? &nbsp;I don't know. &nbsp;Share more stories. &nbsp;Start a newscast. &nbsp;Start a fake-news cast. &nbsp;I don't know. &nbsp;If I ever crowd source a project having a group of people that habitually watch and like what I put out would be helpful. &nbsp;Who knows what will come of it. &nbsp;At the moment it's fun and since I've already written the blog it literally takes about 20 more minutes when I've already spent a few hours writing to get the word out another way.</p>
<p>Lastly, I found that it's easier to get people to view things on youtube. &nbsp;The audience there is millions. &nbsp;STEEMIT is still infant at less than a 100,000. &nbsp;It's just much easier to spread the word on other media platforms, but it's still great to build the story here first.</p>
