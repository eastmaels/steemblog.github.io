<p>You have hopefully heard of the North Dakota Access Pipeline by now. &nbsp;If you haven't you live under a rock or watch main stream media for your news. &nbsp;Here's the best <a href="https://steemit.com/politics/@aggroed/dakota-access-pipe-line-a-portrait-of-nations-in-protest-over-their-right-to-drinking-water">background </a>I could put together on it over a month ago. &nbsp;The basic story is that they found oil in the Dakotas so the plan is to build a giant pipeline from the Dakotas down to Texas. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent.fbos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14329930_10154424218033400_7456155433969103007_n.jpg?oh=6360d6cf51581a4219e6de76e1fe54ae&amp;oe=589533D2" width="960" height="800"/></p>
<p>The controversy is that the company doing it, Dakota Access, &nbsp;wants to build under the Missouri River and go through Native American Reservation Land to do it. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent.fbos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14601019_1223853404329512_4751961324494222909_n.jpg?oh=b6e82a27b9412ab850c398de788bd5bc&amp;oe=58961355" width="720" height="960"/></p>
<p>That sparked the largest Native American protest in over 100 years, and that has sparked a ridiculous show of force by state goon squads.</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent.fbos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14590421_1292887414143212_1309134663855542447_n.jpg?oh=d021175171127f2394628d79d15f1f37&amp;oe=589D2F1D" width="700" height="700"/></p>
<p>Recently, things have been escalating. &nbsp;What started as a government show of force has turned into a violent response by an out of control police force. &nbsp;They are essentially fighting protestors on their own private property to dig a pipeline they don't have the legal footing to build or have the will of the people to support. &nbsp;The people trying to preserve the water and the reservation land are called water protectors. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent.fbos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14523015_10209776655347536_3244959974030380729_n.jpg?oh=335976c8f05b8b2239b06b661dedee7d&amp;oe=5889B0FD" width="600" height="600"/></p>
<p>Here's what the current response looks like. &nbsp;These are highly militarized police who look more like they are in a war zone than facing off against a peaceful protest. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent.fbos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14859647_191254687949032_94333576016169946_o.jpg" width="1600" height="900"/></p>
<p>A story from yesterday details how a Dakoka Access Pipeline Security Officer, Kyle Thompson, went ballistic, crashed his vehicle, brandished his assault rifle, retreated into the river, and ultimately got himself arrested before he actually killed anyone.</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent.fbos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/14632983_1144457848953904_561616530989919619_n.jpg?oh=f386194338f37019e01be3487e4cccb9&amp;oe=58A0B484" width="480" height="480"/></p>
<p>That's not a lone incident. &nbsp;The police are going fucking crazy.</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent.fbos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14568025_667599983365040_2550938115911461125_n.jpg?oh=5deeb7c3a1527b2d4b551198ee227956&amp;oe=589AE12C" width="720" height="960"/></p>
<p>Police are literally shooting the medics in the back!</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQql9pbwKAQ</p>
<p>And these guys didn't come to play. &nbsp;They are armed like war zone troops.</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent.fbos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14883704_10157914629675122_8190237034409976231_o.jpg" width="2048" height="1366"/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/fusionmedianetwork/videos/1620952884597350/">Here's</a> a strong video of them attacking protesters.</p>
<p>They have snipers in the hills, and they shot and killed an 11 year old girl. &nbsp;They attacked a group in prayer. &nbsp;They tasered an elder in the face. &nbsp;They hit the water protectors with percussion grenades. &nbsp;Here's an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/buffalo.child/videos/10154367065821281/">impassioned description</a> of the state violence. &nbsp;They are using <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tim.yakaitis/videos/10157916908425122/">sonic cannons</a> against the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WakingTimes/videos/1192547984158281/">people and the journalists</a>.</p>
<p>Here are two example of police violence.</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent.fbos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14639735_1657138777910160_7910439497851714146_n.jpg?oh=e85c6113cf4cf0f565957f597f0ce0d8&amp;oe=589B5F6A" width="640" height="480"/></p>
<p><img src="https://scontent.fbos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/299197_283521125003928_1168560848_n.jpg?oh=bb5522b872eff57dbbb46dfb1dd05747&amp;oe=589D9C32" width="720" height="540"/></p>
<p>The main point of the action appears to copy the primary response of the Occupy Protest response, which is to <a href="http://sacredstonecamp.org/blog/2016/10/23/141-water-protectors-arrested-as-police-escalate-violent-militarized-response">mass arrest the protesters, </a>&nbsp;brutalize <a href="http://indigenous-network.com/breaking-cops-mass-arrest-and-brutally-pepper-spray-83-native-americans-who-were-praying-for-an-end-to-the-illegal-dakota-access-pipeline/">the protesters</a>, and ultimately &nbsp;<a href="http://sacredstonecamp.org/blog/2016/10/28/police-from-5-states-escalate-violence-shoot-horses-to-clear-1851-treaty-camp">clear the permanent encampment</a> of the protesters. &nbsp;In this case they are using police from 5 states to accomplish it.</p>
<p>The primary response from the water protectors is peaceful prayer and worship, but the state doesn't seem to care. &nbsp;The people that most Americans entrust with guns to protect liberty are the ones using force to squash it.</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent.fbos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14560044_1110381382415025_7050879844594165410_o.jpg" width="2048" height="1536"/></p>
<p><img src="http://indigenous-network.com/breaking-cops-mass-arrest-and-brutally-pepper-spray-83-native-americans-who-were-praying-for-an-end-to-the-illegal-dakota-access-pipeline/"/>It's good to see the citizens of <a href="http://www.unicornriot.ninja/?p=10388">Minneapolis </a>organize a solidarity protest in City Hall in order to recall their Sheriff from North Dakota. &nbsp;That said it's totally fucked that their sheriff is there in the first place!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It's good to watch people taking a stand. &nbsp;I wish I could fly out there and help them. &nbsp;I feel solidarity in my heart for their actions and I would hope that I were living 100 years ago I would have stood with them then too.</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent.fbos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s526x395/14650638_10154445238810831_2869229215873489235_n.jpg?oh=a6fddddfe655778c00fff7157bf077d1&amp;oe=588F6704" width="386" height="395"/></p>
<p>The injustice is great enough to cause <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/amnesty-international-usa-to-monitor-to-north-dakota-pipeline-protests">Amnesty International</a> USA to Monitor the protests. &nbsp;Even former presidential candidate <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-calls-on-president-to-intervene-in-dakota-access-pipeline-dispute">Bernie Sanders</a> has called on the President to de-escalate the response. &nbsp;Hell, the UN is calling out American powers and wants Dakota Access Pipeline <a href="http://wsau.com/news/articles/2016/sep/23/un-wants-dakota-access-pipeline-construction-halted/#.WBHrR8k7JAU.facebook">construction halted</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you feel like helping the natives in their judicial approach go <a href="https://www.generosity.com/fundraising/red-warrior-camp-legal-fund-nodapl">here</a>. &nbsp;If you feel like going all in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thestimulator/videos/10154458041155923/">check this</a> out.</p>
<p>At the very least set your intention that there will be peace, abundance, and liberty. &nbsp;That our environment will be protected and that clean water will be accessible to the rainbow tribe.</p>
