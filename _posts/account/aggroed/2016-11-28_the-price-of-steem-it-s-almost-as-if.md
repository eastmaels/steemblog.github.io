<p>It's almost as if anytime there is any movement upwards in price that there appears to be a massive force behind it pushing it back down. &nbsp;I don't really understand how this will resolve itself. &nbsp;The value of steem can't go up until more people use it. &nbsp;More people won't use it until the price drops and they can buy in cheap. &nbsp;If it goes lower people won't want to blog here because it doesn't make any money (I've made like $2 in my last 4 posts even with 256 followers and a rep of 65). &nbsp;It appears as though the whales don't want to drop a ton of steem for pennies a piece. &nbsp;For the next three months I can't see the price going up without taking a beating back down. &nbsp;And we're gonna be stuck in limbo for a while.</p>
