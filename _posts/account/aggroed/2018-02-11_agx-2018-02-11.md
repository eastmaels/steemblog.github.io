https://agx123.herokuapp.com//2018-02-11.jpg<br/><br/>This is the daily AgX chart for today 2018-02-11.<br/>Today's 200 day moving average is 0.95 and the STEEM/SBD ratio of 0.88.<h3>What is AgX?</h3><br/><br/>The Mayer's multiple (200 days moving average of the BTC/USD price) is known to be a good indicator of the BTC price evolution.
AgX aims to be a similar indicator regarding the STEEM/SBD ratio, in order for users to find the right moment to exchange their SBD for STEEM at the best possible rate.

It would appear that the ratio is dropping to and looking to again favor a high SBD relative to Steem.
