Hey party people I just wanted to give a couple updates on the weekend plans.  I'm hosting three shows.  

## Sounds of Steem

Sounds of Steem is live digital concert on Saturday morning 9am EST.  We'll feature Steem Musicians and it's kinda like a recorded coffee house production.  Get to know some Steemians and hear some amazing music.  I'm gonna host this baby with @swelker101 and @isaria.  Should be fun.

## Peace Academy and backstory writing for Steem Monsters

The Peace Academy is going to be taken over by monsters.  10pm EST to midnight on Saturday night I'm running a show with @isaria, and this one is about the creative endeavor that is Steem Monsters backstory.  I'm working on a campaign setting and I need some authors to help me essentially write a 60 page book about the back story of the world.  My plan is to divide the writers into 6 groups, 1 for each color, and get people writing big chunks of the backstory for each group.

The setting is called the Splinterlands.  The world used to be whole.  Now it's splintered into many pieces, and the prophecy states the world will be made whole again.  We'll write about the different groups and the campaign will go through various areas you create.  Should be fun.  Please join us then to get involved.

## Stat Chat

Ok, Sunday night we're going to unveil in more detail the fighting mechanism we're building into Steem Monsters.  Yaba and I are getting closer to consensus on how this baby works.  We should have something to show and it should be able to give you a bit more guidance of how fighting will work.

Minnow Mayor Town Hall starts at 9pm EST.  come join us.

## Show Logistics

All shows happen in the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel](minnowpond.org)

Just hop in and someone will show you the way.
