Some people see Trump's facial impression like hes leaning into this chart like a mold while facing right.  I see a sharp spike $989,350 to $1,292,550.  That's a marketcap rise of $303,200 in the last month!  That's a marketcap rise of over 30%!

A part of this that makes me pretty happy is to see that Monsters isn't completely coupled to the price of Steem.

Steem Monsters marketcap has been kicking ass for the last week where as the price of Steem has dropped from a recent high of 58 cents down to 48 cents or so.  So, without a doubt a price increase in Steem helps the Steem Monsters ecosystem, but the two aren't perfect correlated meaning that people that buy Steem Monsters aren't making all their financial decisions for their cards simply on the price of Steem.  That's healthy for us!!!

## Coming Soon

We (allegedly) have delegation markets under work through peakmonsters.

We have a market and collection page improvement set on steemmonsters.com

We'll have Dark Energy Crystals, an in game currency, and in game boosts and customizables available soon.


## The trend is your friend and that's happy trend for sure!
