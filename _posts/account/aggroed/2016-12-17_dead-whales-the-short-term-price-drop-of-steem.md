You should check out a new site that @bitcoiner put into the world.  It's steemdown.com.  There you can see the whales that are powering down.  One major one to look at is @steemit, because the founders decided to keep more than 50% of the steem they created...  Well, it's powering down.  In 2 days $154k worth of steem is going to hit the market.  I suspect because of how powering down works that next week an additional $154k of steem will hit and so on going for at least 3 months if not more.

That's a lot of steem.  

Today 84 bitcoins worth of steem were traded.  Each bitcoin is just shy of $800.  So, that's $64000.  So, the total trading today is less than half of what's about to hit the market.... that can't be good for the price of steem ... or is it?

See, to me the biggest scammiest shittiest part of this program is the very poor decision of the founders and employees of steemit to keep so much of the currency.  That's shady as fuck.  Startups don't keep 80% or more when they go looking for funding.  Investors balk.  Here it's even worse because they want this to be a currency.  Would you want to use a currency if 100 people had 80% of it?  Probably not.  Hopefully you'd say something like "Hey, this seems really scammy."

So, before you go rushing to buy on this next price drop from $150k worth of steem hitting the market calm your tits because it's going to happen over and over again for a few months.

If the whales/oligarchs/steem grinches really want this place to succeed they will sell their steem on the cheap.  Many people will buy in at a fair price, and the fact that so many people bought in will cause the price to rise.  In something like 6 months the price will go up to say a $1/steem or more.  If they decide to hold on to their steem at a high and unreasonable price we're going to be sitting in this never ending price slog where it's going to take years for the steem to clear out of the hands of the richest people and the price is going to linger down at $0.10-0.20 for I'm guessing several years.

So, here's my plan that I'm going to do.  Wait a few months for the initial steem dumps to happen.  If the price starts rising I will sell any steem I have into it because as long as 100M steem and steem power are sitting in 30 accounts they will be trying to cash out and that will cause the price to drop back down.  When the steem distribution starts looking reasonable I will start putting real dollars into buying steem because that's when the price will go back up.  

THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE STEEM ECONOMY IS THE REAL VALUE DRIVER OF THE PRICE OF STEEM.  So, if and when it gets accessible prepare yourself for a sustainable rally.

Oh, also it looks like I'm going to lose steemit thousandaire status soon.  So, fml.
