I'm happy to let you know that since tournaments have formed that Players have been awarded $3000 in cards and crypto through the [automated tournament system](https://steemit.com/steemmonsters/@steemmonsters/first-automated-tournament-on-steemmonsters-com-300-steem-prize).  THAT WAS 8 DAYS AGO!!! 

*Are you playing?  Do you even Steem Monsters brah?  Is it fun to watch others earn while playing a game while you're sitting on the sideline?*

We built this game with the idea that not everyone could earn through blogging.  We wanted a game that would invite the world into the rewards that crypto can provide.  So, now you can play a game, earn crypto, hodl tokens, trade them, and sell them when you're done.

**[You should play!](steemmonsters.com)**

## Marketcap

One way to track how the game is progressing is by watching the marketcap.  We got hurt just like everyone else in the crypto market.  Bitcoin lost 85%+ of it's value.  Steem went from $10 to 26 cents.  

Everyone got rekt.  All tokens lost value and SM was no exception.  And it hurt.  That said, since we launched tournaments we've been able to do something awesome.  We strongly reversed a trend in the middle of the longest bear market in the history of bitcoin.  What do you think will happen to Steem Monsters in a bull run?

We have a bot in the Steem Monsters Discord Server that calculates Marketcap.  The bot isn't perfect, but we can track the same number over time and it gives us some sense of the value of the cards.  You can see as the market crashed Steem Monsters was hurt, but you can in the last week or so that Steem Monsters has regained $55-60k in value.  

**Tournaments have been live on the main site for 1 WEEK and we're up $60k what do you think will happen when it's been a year?**

## What the future holds

My crystal ball doesn't work, and I don't know where prices will be tomorrow or a year from now, but when I look at that chart and know what's coming I get excited.  

Delegation, the ability to trustlessly rent cards to other players, will open up the game to new players at a very affordable price and Hodlers will have a chance to earn a passive income.  We were worried nearly a year ago when we opened up gifting as an option as it made it so that players could work with eachother rather than buy cards directly from Steem Monsters.  BUT, because there's more economic freedom it's easier to make a purchase because you know there's more liquidity for the card.  I think gifting and trading accelerated sales.  I predict the same thing here.  

While it's possible that delegation could hurt sales temporarily that's not what I envision happening.  I see a world where new players come in by renting whole pre-built decks on alt accounts without the threat of theft to the owner, I see card hodlers with little time purchasing cards with the intent to rent them out, and I see players with little money able to play at higher levels and enjoy the game more than ever before.  *How do you think this will impact the game?*

Next up is Dark Energy Crystals; an in game currency.  Having an in game currency that can be traded on a DEX available to everyone on Steem, tying it to new products like skins, in game boosts, and votes from the @steemmonsters account will drive engagement.  You'll literally get paid for your wins!  Trade that token for in game goods, cards from peers, votes from Steem Monsters, and new expasion stuff we'll launch on the site after DEC exists.

One key feature of the expansion is that players can melt cards down to get DEC.  *What do you think will happen to supply of cards if suddenly everyone can take cards they no longer want and turn them into DEC to spend on other stuff?  What do you think will happen to the price of cards?*

## The time is now

I can't tell you what's right for your family, finances, or friends, but I know what's right for me.  I'm already the largst hodler of Steem Monsters cards and I'm simply here to inform you I keep buying them.  I buy the golds to win the big tournaments, I buy summoners which everyone needs to rent out later, and with DEC even closer I'm buying the cheapest cards out there with a plan to melt'm down and get other stuff.

If you're on a break from Steem Monsters I'd encourage you to come back!  If you're already playing consider pushing up a tier.  If you're brand new to the game consider dipping your toe in.

The trend is your friend and this trend looks great!  

*I hope this post was informative and enjoyable as that was the sole intention!*
