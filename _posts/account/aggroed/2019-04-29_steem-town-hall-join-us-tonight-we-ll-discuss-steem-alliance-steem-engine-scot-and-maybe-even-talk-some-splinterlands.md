Ok, lots of things happening on and around Steem.  You're going to want to tune in tonight and we'll break down some of the changes and new features to the chain.  You can join us on msp-waves through mspwaves.com/listen, or join us in Discord through minnowpond.org.

There's some epic shit out there.  Let's talk about it!
