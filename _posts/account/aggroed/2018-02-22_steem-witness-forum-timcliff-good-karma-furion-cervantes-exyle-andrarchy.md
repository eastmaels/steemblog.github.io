I'm pleased to announce the monthly Steem Panel Discussion on MSP-Waves.  We'll kick off the meeting with @andrarchy. 
 He's the new Director of Content for Steemit Inc.  He'll answer some questions and reiterate some of the recent news from @steemitblog [read here](https://steemit.com/steemit/@steemitblog/steemit-winter-update-2017-reflection-our-vision-statement-and-mission-and-a-look-forward)

After that I'll welcome top 20 Witnesses @timcliff, @good-karma, @furion as well as back up witnesses @cervantes and @exyle will have a discussion with me about the state of the Steem ecosystems, projects we're working on, and challenges that we as a community need to meet head on.
