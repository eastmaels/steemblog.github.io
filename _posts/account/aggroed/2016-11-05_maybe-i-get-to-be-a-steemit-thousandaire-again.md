<p>Ned and Dan finally changed the game. &nbsp;Now we can get back to making money once the changes go through. &nbsp;A while ago after a number of posts I saw for a brief minute that I had an account value of $1k. &nbsp;I was officially a steemit thousandaire (like a millionaire, but shittier). &nbsp;Today after Dan and Ned's @steemitblog <a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@steemitblog/proposed-changes-to-steem-economy">post</a></p>
<p>the markets have gone up substantially. &nbsp;I have 4k SP. &nbsp;Markets are approaching $0.25/steem. &nbsp;I might actually be a steemit thousandaire by the time I wake up.</p>

<p>Ned and Dan learned that hyperinflation is bad. &nbsp;Maybe we can move out of <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@krnel/steembabwe-the-inflation-devaluation-issue">Steembabwe</a>. &nbsp;Great work!</p>
