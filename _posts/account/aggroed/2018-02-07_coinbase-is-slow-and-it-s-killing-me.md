So, yesterday I bought the dip.  I kinda screwed up my buy ladder, but I tossed one in when we dropped under the support line that has held since early January.  I wish I had reversed my buy amounts, but other than that I think it's ok.

I bought a total of $18k of litecoin.

I was mostly watching the btc charts.  

I bought $5k at 8k btc
I bought $5k at 7.5k btc
I bought $5k at 7k btc
I bought $2k at 6.8k btc
and bought $1k at 6.2k btc

My overall average price for ltc is $134.  It's currently $153 and may actually break out of the resistance.  I say that because of BTC looks like it has free range to go up another $1k or more.

Looks like btc broke through the most recent resistance trend line and is heading up to the one that we've been riding for a month (a crypto eternity).

After just watching my Pats lose I keep thinking about this as a running back trying to break through various parts of the zone defense.  Looks like btc just broke through the defensive line with breaching the recent resistance line, and now gets a few extra yards in before getting to the linebackers waiting for him at 9.4k btc or so.

This might also all be garbage and markets just move regardless of what charts show.  Still learning.

Anyway, I feel like a champ right this second except for the fact that I get half my purchase on the 10th, and rest by the 14th.  1 week right now could send that value fucking anywhere...  Fucking killing me to make a good buy and lose the opportunity because coinbase taking a week is going to kick my ass...  I'm hoping for an LTC breakout today as btc drives up another 1300 or so until it meets the primary resistance line.

## Anyone have 134 litecoin they want to lend me for 1 week so I could just lock in profits? <h2>

PS this isn't advice.  It's just what I did.  Make up your own mind.
