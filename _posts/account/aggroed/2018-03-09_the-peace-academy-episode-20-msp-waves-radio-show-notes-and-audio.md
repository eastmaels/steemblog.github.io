# The Peace Academy Episode 20 // Msp-Waves Radio Show Notes and Audio


<center> ![](https://i.imgur.com/xTqPqWi.png) </center>




Last week on the Peace Academy we discussed breaking free from a victim mentality.

Psychological studies have shown that those who choose to maintain a victim mentality are often selfish, manipulative, filled with anger, and have an irrational sense of entitlement.

We all have struggles, but we don't have to let our struggle become our identity.

Understanding that our own thoughts shape our realities, self-awareness, taking responsibility for our life choices, and letting go of the past are all ways to move away from a victim mentality mindset.






There's a saying, *"Victims are violent"*

Those exhibiting the most toxic form of victim mentality are often filled with unresolved anger that is usually directed toward others in the form of blaming, emotional manipulation emotional blackmail, or revenge/punishment.

I'll talk more about how to deal with Toxic Behaviors in the next Peace Academy Curriculum post.
