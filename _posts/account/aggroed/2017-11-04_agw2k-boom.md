So, I'm a fan of milestone posts.  This one is my favorite to report so far.  I liked it when I hit 1,000 followers.  I loved it when I hit 5,000.  It was awesome when I hit the top 50 witnesses after months of trying, and pretty amazing when I made it into the top 20.  A couple of things are happening at the same time.

## 2,000 Witness votes <h2>

Techincally I hit this a little while back, but steemdb wasn't showing it so I didn't want to report it.  Sometime in the last week or so I finally hit 2,000 witness votes.  Gotta tell ya, it feels amazing!  I ran for public office before, and I got 6k votes, but these votes are from Steemians.  These folks are woke.  This means 10x to me than the previous votes I received.

## Rep 71 <h2>

I'm about to hit a rep of 71.  There aren't too many of us.  I feel like I'm in an exclusive club.  I've worked pretty damn hard for the post rewards I've earned over the last year and a half.  I'm stoked to get here.  Thanks for your support.

## MSP 5month <h2>

Hard to believe but the Minnow Support Project has only existed since June 1.  We've passed 5 months.  That's feelin' pretty good too.  I love the fishes in the pond and it's tons of fun to keep it going.

## MSP Waves <h2>

These guys are in teh process of leveling up.  Pretty soon we'll have an app and some more ways to view our material.  I'll keep plugging some SP into the account to reward the DJs and the people that run the station.

## All things considered.... <h2>

Life is pretty good!  Steem on, and thanks for stickin' with me!  A special thanks to the mega whales that upvote muh Witness.  I wouldn't be here without your support.
