<p>Has anyone else noticed the prolonged absence of Hillary Clinton since "she" emerged from Chelsea Clinton's NY "apartment"?</p>
<p>Lots of rumors flying around. &nbsp;Is she dead? &nbsp;Is she recovering? &nbsp;Is she using a <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@aggroed/secretary-clinton-teresa-barnwell-a-professional-clinton-impersonator-and-a-potential-unidentified-body-double-at-the-9-11">bodydouble</a>? &nbsp;Was she <a href="https://ascendingstarseed.wordpress.com/2016/09/12/apparently-hillary-was-arrested-video-shows-she-was-handcuffed-and-forced-into-the-van/">arrested</a>? Does she have health problems above and beyond dehydration, allergies, or pneumonia? &nbsp;<a href="http://www.fury.news/2016/09/renowned-pathologist-claiming-hillary-poisoned/">Was she poisoned by Trump and Putin?</a> &nbsp;I for one would like to add another question in this post. &nbsp;I think she used a #hillarysvoicedouble, but we're not there yet. &nbsp;Is this an elaborate way to avoid the legal problems she's about to land in that are assocaited with the Clinton Foundation and DNC <a href="http://magafeed.com/guccifer-2-0-leaks-robert-a-mandell-pays-dnc/">pay to become an Ambassador situation </a>as discovered by Guccifer 2.0 leaks?</p>

<p>Only time will tell. &nbsp;Let's start with what we know and then go into speculation after-</p>
<p>I'm assuming you're not in worse condition than Hillary and managed to watch this footage of her going limp while leaving the 9/11 memorial ceremony and heading over to Chelsea Clinton's apartment.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFFSTK4kK8o</p>
<p>What you may not know about that <a href="https://profiles.health.ny.gov/home_health/view/18676">apartment </a>is that it used to serve as a New York State Department of Health certified Home Health Care service.</p>
<p><img src="https://s16.postimg.org/g6mswpds5/home_health_care.jpg" width="715" height="447"/></p>
<p>OK, so out comes a woman who resembles Clinton at 50 rather than her actual age of 68. &nbsp;Home Health care or not it's extremely unlikely that Clinton would suffer medical issues and then emerge 4 hours later from Chelseas appartment or home health care clinic looking 10 years younger, 50lbs lighter, and speaking with a voice that doesn't stress from pnuemonia-like symptoms. &nbsp;I made a <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@aggroed/secretary-clinton-teresa-barnwell-a-professional-clinton-impersonator-and-a-potential-unidentified-body-double-at-the-9-11">post</a> about it.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CsKo7auXYAAJeot.jpg:large" width="650" height="463"/></p>
<p>People also note the distinct lack of standard security detail around her after she appears.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CsJuNj7UIAAz5jU.jpg" width="1200" height="675"/></p>
<p>Anyway, she went to her <a href="http://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/g3549/hillary-clinton-chappaqua-house/?slide=1">private </a>place in <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/3469038/posts">Chappequa, NY</a>. &nbsp;It's noteworthy that the whole place is apparently guarded like a fortress right now.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/09/13/19/384227C900000578-3787654-image-a-12_1473792883625.jpg"/></p>
<p><a href="http://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/g3549/hillary-clinton-chappaqua-house/?slide=1">Here's </a>a slide show of the inside of the house and general property.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>She cancelled her appearance on <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/09/12/hillary-clinton-cancels-scheduled-ellen-degeneres-interview-after-pneumonia-diagnosis/">Ellen</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-534066544-e1473692797353.jpg"/></p>
<p>And you know it's really bad because she <a href="https://twitter.com/DougNBC/status/775322512968253440">cancelled </a>her CA funding trip, and her Ohio<a href="https://twitter.com/whiotv/status/775329119169024000"> appearances were taken</a> by Chelsea.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CsKcM4eUEAAYLoQ.jpg" width="715" height="860"/></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The campaign says she'll be back <a href="https://twitter.com/elizacollins1/status/775821542714380288">tomorrow</a>. &nbsp;We'll see.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Anyway, she calls into Anderson Cooper after she gets out of the <del>home hospital complex </del>apartment. &nbsp;Now it actually makes sense that she might just call in after being sick and passing out. &nbsp;That's cool, what doesn't make sense is that she makes it through 10 minutes of interview with Anderson without coughing once. &nbsp;That's why I'm introducing the thought that she used a voice double. &nbsp;Listen to how crisp she sounds in the video and tell me that's the same woman seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsGUSdhHIt8">spitting out green chunks</a> of whatever while hacking and not getting through 30 seconds of a speech without drinking water, begging the audience for forgiveness for the coughing disruption, and sounding incredibly horse.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhn7M_7ZZZs</p>
<p>The campaign says she didn't see a doctor until she got to Chappequa, but I'm suspicious. &nbsp;Here's the video where they talk about the move.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaLlcdbn1Hg</p>
<p>Do you notice the shit eating grin at 2:18? &nbsp;He can't contain himself. &nbsp;His body is fighting the lie. &nbsp;It's a classic case of deceiver's delight. &nbsp;You can see that here at around 50 seconds very clearly. &nbsp;See if they match for you too.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GutAbsKWLsY</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Anyway. &nbsp;Those are some of the least weird things to come out. &nbsp;The most weird are multiple claims by ABC news that she's already dead. &nbsp;The official announcements came out it was allergies, then dehydration, and then officially disclosed pnuemonia. &nbsp;Others have said she has symptoms of pneumonia, Parkinsons, and Dementia. &nbsp;I linked those three illnesses together with some other symptoms as tertiary syphilis <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@aggroed/medical-conjecture-secretary-clinton-likely-suffers-from-late-stage-syphilis">here</a>. &nbsp;But over the past two days people have caught screen shots and recordings of ABC posting that she died.</p>
<p>ABC news reports she died at a hospital-</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CsQtEU2WYAAZ_JP.jpg:large" width="1024" height="576"/></p>
<p>It was also reported on WABC7- You know ABC! &nbsp;The giant TV channel.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=jLrc-YAdoQo</p>
<p>ABC was contacted by Alex Jones and they shared that it was real footage, but an accident and not true. &nbsp;I could believe that for 1 piece of news, but not two from the same outfit. &nbsp;Don't get me wrong... I don't think she's necessarily dead. &nbsp;I think it's possible she is, but I also think it's a way to fake her death too so that she doesn't have to face justice for the war crimes, civil crimes, and heinous deeds she's committed over an extended public political career as well as an extended shady private career at the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-09-12/hillary-clintons-campaign-needs-hire-better-liars">real conspiracy</a> here is that there's nothing wrong with her.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Anyway, if you don't think something is up then just stay calm. &nbsp;She has <del>pnuemonia</del> the flu and will be back tomorrow.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX7aGUV0y-E</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All that aside... Some voters won't care-</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent.fbos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14330058_1670336053294815_1015017350235417593_n.jpg?oh=0ba605ee47b2752333f539b0c4d2ef8b&amp;oe=58448FBE" width="539" height="301"/></p>
<p>If you like that option though I have a story about it here: &nbsp;https://steemit.com/writing/@aggroed/satirically-yours-s1e9-unidentified-woman-falls-victim-to-zombie-infection-begins-campaigning-in-nyc&nbsp;</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Lastly. &nbsp;I just want to remind everyone that I have no intention of dying anytime soon. &nbsp;We're all in perfect health right now. &nbsp;No one is suicidal. &nbsp;I'm in a loving happy family. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Media be like @aggroed committed suicide.</p>
