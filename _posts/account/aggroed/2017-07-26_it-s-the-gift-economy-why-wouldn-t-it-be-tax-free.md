I've seen a lot of tax articles come through.  A lot of statists are running around sharing how you should immediately bend over and wilfully declare and depart with as much revenue from steemit as you can as quickly as you can to please your taxation overlords.  I'm not sure that's necessary.  It's also morally wrong.  If you think murdering dark skinned people over seas for their resources "causes harm" then you have a moral obligation to resist.

Let's also be clear on another thing.  Taxation is theft.  That's pretty simple.  Third parties engaged in my transactions to take a portion of my wealth to allow me the privilege of trading with another party under threat of violence is theft.  Just cause it happens every day does NOT make it lawful or moral.

## Well, what else could we do? <h2>

It's called the gift economy.  We're giving gifts.  It's not a transaction.  You posted an article in a public place with no pre-arrangement for votes (unless you're a circle jerking colluder).  Look if you use @booster or something that might be a little harder to claim, but if all you're doing is popping an article in a public place and people are upvoting you randomly pretty sure those are gifts.  Pretty sure I'm going to call them gifts.

## Why's it matter? <h2>

Cause tax law allows for up to $14,000 a year to be gifted tax free.  So, unless  the likes of @ned, @freedom, and @steemit start max upvoting muh blog every day I don't think I'm gonna hit that limit for any one individual person.  Problem solved,

## If you get votes from me they are gifts <h2>

So, I'm publicly declaring that any upvote from me is a gift.  You're welcome.  I love ya.  It's not a transaction.  It's not a tip for a service you directly provided me.  It's a gift free and clear without any expectation back.  If you think I'm missing something then pop your concerns in the comments.  If you're going to tell me taxes are the price we pay for society then en garde.
