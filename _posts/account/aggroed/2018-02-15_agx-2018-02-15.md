https://agx123.herokuapp.com//2018-02-15.jpg<br/><br/>This is the daily AgX chart for today 2018-02-15.<br/>Today's 200 Moving day average factor is 0.95 with a current STEEM/SBD ratio of 0.79.<h3>What is AgX?</h3><br/><br/>The Mayer's multiple (200 days moving average of the BTC/USD price) is known to be a good indicator of the BTC price evolution.
AgX aims to be a similar indicator regarding the STEEM/SBD ratio, in order for users to find the right moment to exchange their SBD for STEEM at the best possible rate.  When the blue line is at the top of the chart it's a good time to sell Steem and pickup SBD.  When the blue line is at the bottom of the chart it's a good time to sell SBD and pickup Steem.  When it's hovering near the red line it's pretty tough at this stage to know what to do.

This is gonna stay on my wall about 1 more week.  Then I'm moving the automatic posts to @agx.
