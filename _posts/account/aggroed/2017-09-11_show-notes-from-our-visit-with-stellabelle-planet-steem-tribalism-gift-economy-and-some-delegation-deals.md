I've been doing the Minnow Mayor Townhall for a while now.  Maybe a month.  I've done a bunch of pirate shows too when we first started and didn't have as many DJs, but I gotta say that was my favorite show I've done.  6 months ago I asked Stella if I could interview her, and I finally got my chance on air.  The lady did not disappoint!

@stellabelle I continue to find you and your story inspirational.  I enjoyed talking about the broad view of the Steemit ecosystem with you.  I think your thoughts on building a tribal community is spot on.  I've shared before this place supports the authors as much as they do the content of the posts, so taking time to build out your community is so worth it.

We touched on addiction and some of the depression that comes with the awakening.  A large number of awake people at some point go through a "I lost everything" moment or period and that impacts their understanding of how this planet works.

You used Planet Steem a number of times.  We do seem a little off in our own little world sometimes, but I think that with a focus on building tools, community, and community tools we'll continue to grow our little Planet into a giant one.  Steemit is so powerful in it's ability to spread peace and non-violence, abundance through actions that cost little or nothing, and censorship resistant speech except when the community doesn't want it.  It's not just a game changer, but a world changer.

More than just your thoughts I find you an incredibly passionate soul.  I like how you're mentoring people and trying to spread the values beyond through teaching.  I'm an educator too and I can see the value in what you're doing.  My short answer is that you're a class act beyond what I already thought (and I already held you in high esteem).

## The audience <h2>

We also had a pretty solid audience show up.  I believe we capped out at 40 people on the show.  Averaged around 32 for most of the show and likely had at least 60 folks come through.  You all were engaged, thoughtful, and hopefully had some fun with the delegations and dice.

Thanks to @swelker101 for taking over dice for me that night.  I coudn't do both the interview and Dice Bitches!   So, thanks!

The Dice Bitches game changed a little because of time pressure, but looks like @gmuxx and @bearone took home a prize of 25 SBD each.  Good times!

## 1500 SP delegation <h2>

I had included a 1500 SP delegation contest.  It was a scavenger hunt designed to force minnows to do things that dolphins do.  We had a dozen people enter and I had 10 people that had completed it show up in the channel.  So all told you had a 10% chance to win if you participated.  Anyway, the winner with @avesa and I sent them 1500SP as a delegation this morning.  Bud, you get to keep that until you earn 5000 SP on your own, and then you need to send it back so I can continue to pay it forward.

## 500 SP delegation <h2>

So, this was one of my favorite moments of the night.  I like running the contests, but also, I love the spirit that manifested.  The contest works by folks recruit others into the show and they get a chance for a delgation.  @choogirl worked her ass off and brought a ton of people into the show.  So, she got more "tickets" than other people in the raffle, and as a result of that hard work she won.  Immediately, without prompting she says "I want to split the reward with the person I brought in" that was @bmj a member of teamaustralia so they've got 250 SP delegation sitting in their wallet (when you hit 5k SP earned you gotta give it back).  

@choogirl isn't done yet though.  She says "Also, I'm gonna give my other half to my girl Kubby!"  Which in itself is awesome.  I love the culture of giving, but then Kubby says "WOOT, and I'm proxying for my girl @uniwhisp!"  So, just like that the 250 SP delegation gets passed a few times.  So, Choogirl gets the rush of winning and giving.  @kubbyelizabeth gets the rush of giving, and @uniwhisp gets a very well earned and well deserved 250 SP delegation.  She's a class act, helps run the radio station, and is just a very caring person.

So, on top of a fantastic discussion with my girl Stella I also got to witness some of the most wonderful gifting culture I could hope for just in my little neck of the woods.  It literally brings a tear to my eye and I give you a very grateful, love filled, and humbled thank you!  MSP man... you folks are a dream come true.

Namaste, 
your teary-eyed witness, 

@aggroed
