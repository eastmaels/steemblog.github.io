It's time to pahk ya cah in the city and get ready to fuck up some smaht kids.  That's right, we're doing another Boston meetup this Satahday.  Plan is lunch in the city followed by some time at a board game cafe called Knight Moves in Brookline.

We'll meet at Fugakyu for some sushi at 1pm.  We'll hang out there and have some good healthy conversation about the Steem ecosystem, how to be successful here,  how to grow your account from mere plankton to epic Steem boss, and do it with style and fun.

Then we're gonna roll on ovah to Knight Moves.  We'll have some time to pick up games and pwn some newbs at Euro style games.  Catan, Dominion, and Carcesone galore.  It's good times and good people.

## Logistics <h2>

Fugakyu Japanese Cuisine- 1280 Beacon St Brookline MA 02446
Event starts at 1pm.  Please RSVP here if you're coming so we can make sure the table size is right.
You can find [menu options here](https://www.opentable.com/fugakyu-japanese-cuisine?page=1).

At 3pm or so we'll leave there and head to Knight Moves.
This is at 1402 Beacon St, in Brookline.
Again, please RSVP to this so we know how big of a space to make sure we have.

We'll hang out until about 7pm.  Then I gotta get back home so I can host the Peace Academy on msp-waves.  

## Film <h2>

I'll very likely bring a video camera to this.  No one gets filmed that doesn't want to be.  Goal is to get footage of real Steemians telling their story of what brought them to the platform and give a face to a Boston Steemian.
