Hey guys.  If I'm a little quiet it's not cause I'm dead... or at least I hope not.  I'm flying to Mexico for Anarchopulco.  I have a bag with some Steem Monsters gear, some free Steem Monsters accounts (which include Steem accounts), and i'm planning on hanging out in the gamers den for a good portion of the next few days pitching this game to the people.


## News Teaser

Steem Monsters and Steem-Engine should have some big news coming out soon, so stay tuned!  Hopefully this whole chain is super excited about both the things we're releasing shortly.


## Find me in the Gamer's den

If you're heading down as well please come find me in the gamers den.  I'd very much like to see and meet people live.
