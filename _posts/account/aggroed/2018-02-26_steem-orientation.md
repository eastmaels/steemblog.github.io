So, there's a lot of new people joining the platform.  I'm doing my best to put out some educational content that will help them get started here and learn about this place.  Frankly, Steem is tricky.  Steem, steem power, SBD, vests, markdown, voting bots, blockchain, Discord, reward pool, and a million other buzzwords, vocab, and dynamics make this place hard.  I haven't figured out a great way to fix it other than releasing some orientation posts every so often.  I'm shooting for one a month.  

## Process <h2>

So, it's relatively simple.  I start by announcing the orientation, and then treating it like any other broadcast out of msp-waves.  I start by going through what the different buttons on the website do, and trying to talk through some of the terms they are going to see and interact with.  After I've done that for literally 30-45 min I start taking questions.

## The Video <h2>

So, here is my orientation from last Saturday the 17th of Feb.  It's a pretty standard approach to explaining all this stuff.  I think it's best for a brand new Steemian.  "Hey I like art and photography... what the hell is this place?!?"  If they say that kind of stuff they are the target audience!
