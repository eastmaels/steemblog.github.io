First things first.  For every story there has to be a setting.  We need a world.  We need maps.  Contest time!

## Build a world 

I'm calling on artists from around the platform.  I need your help!

Build a map of the world.  It's incredibly open ended, but here's what we know.  There is a white team which represents astral and protective aspects of the world.  Black which represents dark sorcery and necromancy.  Red, blue, and green which represent the elements of fire, water, and earth.  Lastly there are the dragons of gold.

We may change the map over time and allow the story that unfolds to reshape the map, break it, heal it, add it to.  We'll zoom in and out of regions as we discover new cities, new cultures, and new tribes.  None of that is possible without a starting map.

##  Contest

Create a fantasy map of the Steem Monsters World.  You're welcome to incorporate art from the game into this.  Try to stick with the theme of the game to the best of your ability.  If your creation is selected we may have some edits so hopefully you're using some layers in photoshop.  This contest will run for a week.  When this post expires so does the contest entry time.

## How to submit

Make a post that has your artwork in it.  Put that post as a comment in this post.  If you want to create art and not let us use it that's find, but if you leave your post as a comment to this post you are agreeing to allow us to use your creation for commercial aspects of Steem Monsters.

## What you promise

By submitting a picture you're giving us the copyright to use.    You submit it only by linking a post that you've created with the art embedded into the comments below.

## What we promise

The winner will receive 50 booster decks.
Second place will receive 30 booster decks.
Third place will receive 20 booster decks.

20 booster decks are up for grabs for lower places and for good comments regarding submissions.

More importantly is promotion.  This game is already getting people super excited.  Your map is going to be built into the steemmonsters.com website and we'll link to your original post and your steemit profile page.  As we grow this is going to amount to some of the best exposure on the Steem Blockchain.  Hopefully you'll see the art you create for us will serve as a fantastic promotional tool for you.

## What may happen

If you win or place or just have some cool ideas it's possible we'll merge some of this stuff together.  We hope that this is less of a final product and more of an evolving map that can twist and turn.  It'll be fun to have more than one person that can contribute in such a way.  The main point is that we'll likely ask you to tweak some work to fit in with game play, future visions, new cards etc.  We probably want to include some inside jokes to the Steem community to other steemians through names, graveyards, tombs, objects etc.  Let's start by building some hints of that into the map too.
