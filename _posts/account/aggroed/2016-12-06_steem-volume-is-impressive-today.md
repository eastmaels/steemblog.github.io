<p>(Yeah, I'm a science guy, so that's the equation for volume. &nbsp;Get over it). &nbsp;While a lot of people are going to talk about the price of Steem rising up over $0.20 at least before the whale sell off starts in earnest what really intrigues me is the volume.</p>

<p>I took this off of Poloniex about two minutes ago right before it breaks 1200 bitcoins worth of steem. &nbsp;it's a little shy of $1M and will probably hit that later today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's exciting. &nbsp;I haven't seen that much since I got here a few months ago. &nbsp;Looks like the Hardfork is bringing people in. &nbsp;So, that's a good thing.</p>
