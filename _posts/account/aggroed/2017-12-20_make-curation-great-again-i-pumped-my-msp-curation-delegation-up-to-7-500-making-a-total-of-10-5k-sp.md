So @msp-curation is launching full steem ahead.  I just delegated a total of 7,500 SP.  There's an additional 3,000 on the account thanks to @ausbitbank bringing the total up to 10,500 SP!!!!

@isaria is leading the charge with @juliakponsford to ensure that the Minnow Support Project isn't just spam upvoting all minnow content, but also looking for high quality people and high quality posts.  We'll support them on the platform as part of our mission to spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, grow the Steem ecosystem, and train and retain minnows on the platform.

@acidyo has done a good analysis showing that those curated by the OCD team end up staying on the platform to a much higher extent than those who don't get early curation.  So, we're following that model to some extent and making sure that folks that come to Steem and stand out get rewarded and stick around.  Looking forward to helping minnows grow!
