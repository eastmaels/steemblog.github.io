https://agx123.herokuapp.com//2018-02-19.jpg<br/><br/>This is the daily AgX chart for today 2018-02-19.<br/>Today's 200 day moving average is 0.94 for a STEEM/SBD ratio of 0.82.<h3>What is AgX?</h3><br/><br/>The Mayer's multiple (200 days moving average of the BTC/USD price) is known to be a good indicator of the BTC price evolution.
AgX aims to be a similar indicator regarding the STEEM/SBD ratio, in order for users to find the right moment to exchange their SBD for STEEM at the best possible rate.

When the blue line is in the top third of the graph it's an historically good time to sell Steem and buy SBD.  When the blue line is in the bottom third of the graph it's an historically good time to sell SBD and buy Steem.

AgX will continue to be printed on @aggroed for this week, but will be moving to it's own page @agx "soon."
