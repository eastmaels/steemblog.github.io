<p>Farmer Patrick Santorum is no stranger to growing large pumpkins or getting into fist fights and arrests over them. &nbsp;This past year at the Georgia State Fair Patrick delivered a prize winning 854 pound Pumpkin. &nbsp;Fair attendees were stunned as they gazed upon the sheer mass of pumpkin. &nbsp;That said, not all fair goers were pleased.</p>

<p>Dale Norquest McGinacutty the Third was not pleased at all as his pumpkin came in second weighing in at 812 lbs. &nbsp;Originally he was quoted as saying &nbsp;"I hate losing to that son of a bitch."</p>
<p>Apparently the altercation happened at the State Fair after the weights of the Pumpkins were announced and Patrick approached Dale to say "Hey Dale, you did a great job. &nbsp;That's great effort. &nbsp;You did everything you set out to do assuming you meant to grow a second place pumpkin. &nbsp;Can't win them all bitch."</p>
<p>Dale was quick on his feet to remind Patrick of his wife's previous publicly known case of infidelity.</p>

<p>"Funny you should mention that. &nbsp;I was just speaking to your wife Chessie about this with Roger. &nbsp;You remember Roger. &nbsp;He banged your wife like half a million times and everyone knows about it." &nbsp;Dale wore his shit eating grin proudly.</p>
<p>According to local fair goer Trisha McNartamier the fight started shortly after they had that exchange.</p>

<p>"Well, Patrick took to tauntin' Dale about his pumpkin, and Dale took to tauntin' Patrick about his wife Chessie, Bless her Heart. &nbsp;Anyway, once he made that one comment about Chessie Patrick came out a'swingin'. &nbsp;I thought for sure they was gonna smash right through their own prize winnin' pumpk'ns."</p>
<p>She added "When the cops came that's when it all escalated!"</p>

<p>Officer Velent Cillor showed up on the scene and delivered taser shots to both suspects. &nbsp;Dale has since been hospitalized and all of America awaits to find out if he'll survive the altercation.</p>

<p>Lastly, prizes were stripped from both contestants letting Shirley Delight win for the first time in 6 years.</p>
