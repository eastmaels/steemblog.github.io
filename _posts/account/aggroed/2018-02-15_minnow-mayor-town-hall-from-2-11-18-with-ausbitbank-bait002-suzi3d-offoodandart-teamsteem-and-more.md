I have a very dynamic show for you today.  We start with a little financial blabber from me, switch to a new food project on the block, hang out with my friend and cofounder of MSP @ausbitbank, get involved in a very dynamic interview with @suzi3d, and wrap up with a great conversation with @teamsteem. It's a great one! 

## On the Show: <h2>

12:30- We talk about a new group of folks working on food blogging, vlogging, and contests!  @offoodandart is the mother of @theywillkillyou who own a 1M sub Youtube channel of the same name.  I'm looking forward to what they come up with!

@bait002
I'm happy to introduce Bait.  He's a Nigerian that's working on building up the already 20,000 strong community.  He runs a group called the Minnow Schools and teaches people how to use crypto.  He's also working on steemexchanger which is a automated program to turn steem into African currencies.  This is game changing because right now Africans are mostly reliant on converting between crypto and fiat using telegram groups.  This is an automated way to exchange currencies, which can remove trust issues between counter parties and eliminate a major hurdle to decentralized transactions.  Updates can be found on the @steemexchanger blog.

@ausbitbank comes on the show around the 1:06:00

We talk about finding Steem through a trading group that was looking for developers and looking for ways to circumvent controlled media.

We talk about the pathway from content creation to content curation as he's become a whale.  We talk about managing projects on the block, a day in the life of Ausbitbank, and what it's like managing the Minnow Support Project.


@suzi3d 1:40:00 live from Moscow.  Suzi is a powerhouse independent journalist bringing other journalists to the Steem platform and sharing her story of going from a suburban mom to a vigilant citizen against the corruption of the deep state through the massive private spy networks that have been created.  This was a powerful interview for me and I hope you take some time to go through it.

@teamsteem 2:59:00 joins us to share his enthusiasm for the steem blockchain, the pursuit of truth in a fake news world, and talks a little about how we handles his trading and shares one of his favorite sites: http://newbium.com/.  We also talk about some of the value of block chain currencies instead of fiat currencies.
