We'll have on a list of performers starting at 11:00.

Performers please make sure you're there at least by 10:45 to sound check and make sure you're good.


## Two notes.  The [auction to become a heroic boss](https://steemit.com/steemmonsters/@aggroed/boss-fight-auction-get-put-into-steem-monsters-as-the-first-boss-in-guild-boss-fights) in Steem Monsters ends today.  Neoxian is winning it at 600 steem.  If you're a whale check it out.


## Other shows
