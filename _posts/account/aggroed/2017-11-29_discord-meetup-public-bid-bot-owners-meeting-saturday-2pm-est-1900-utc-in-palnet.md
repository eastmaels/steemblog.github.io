Bid Bots are a hot topic these days.  Opinions range from beneficial to investors to reward pool raping bastards.  It's a little hot and heated.  I wanted to bring together bid bot owners into a public forum.  ~~Other shows are happening at that time so it won't be broadcast on mspwaves~~ We are free to broadcast this on mspwaves and will be doing so.  We'll all join up within PALnet in a Discord Live on Air channel.  

The public is welcome to attend, but the majority of voice conversation will be limited to bid bot owners.  I'll record the conversation and post it so the public can see this isn't a bunch of rich bastards smoking cigars in a black room trying to cheat minnows and instead it's a group of concerned business owners trying to provide a valuable service in an ethical and profitable way.

Topics include:

Ethical bid bot operations
black lists
white lists
expectation setting
best practice
abuse prevention
steemcleaners alignment
PAlnet/MSP blacklist alignment
