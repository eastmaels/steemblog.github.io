4 days ago I was sitting at ~450 followers.  Since then: Steem up!  Followers up!  $100 post!  100 voter post!

## Recap <h2>

It's been a really cool week.  Actually, I think it's my best week on steem so far.  I was looking through my old posts.  I think I have 5 posts that have made more than $100.  I have roughly that for the number of posts that have been upvoted by 100 people.  This week I have one at $100 and two with over 100 votes going as we speak!

This week I've really done my best to try to help the community.  Especially the newbie population.  I've been a teacher and a professor for a total of 8 years.  I've been in higher education since 2001 with just a few years away from it.  I like to teach and I like to help new people work on and discover things I enjoy.  This has honestly been one of the coolest teaching weeks of my life.  I've really enjoyed it!

## The people make this place wonderful and make the currency have value <h2>

The coolest part has been the comments!  People seem really grateful to have some help with steemit.  I remember a year ago I had a ton of questions!  Now I get to have a ton of answers, and it's really personally rewarding to see it helping.  @missiontothemoon shared they already won over 50 followers because of the advice I've written.  It's only been up for 3 days!  THAT'S AMAZING!

What I'm trying to this is thank you for the upvotes, thank you for the comments, thank you for following me, and honestly a huge shoutout to @kaylinart.  I learned a ton watching and studying her work.  She's my unofficial mentor!

If you know a vocab word for "Intense feelings of gratitude"  please share it in the comments!  If you don't have a word, but would like to share something you're feeling grateful for it I'd be touched to have you share in the comments!
