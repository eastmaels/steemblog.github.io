Money is constantly sloshing around within the cryptosphere.  There's lots of volume and the prices are volatile.  For many this represents sheer financial terror as the only certain thing is that crypto has almost no certainty in price.   For others it's an opportunity to use trading to grow one's wealth. 

## It could fit <h2>

If you have a few hundred, a few thousand, or even more dollars and have some fears of where to park it where you can potentially earn some amazing gains then crypto could be a good home for your money.  While other traditional investments have a million people in this country eager to help you manage the ropes it's still fairly difficult to find someone that can show you the ropes in crypto trading.

## The Topic <h2>

So, I present to you a panel of relatively small scale investors who can take an average person through what it looks like to trade reasonable sums of money on centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, bring it in and out through fiat and all explore some of the tools and approaches that are available to investors.

This is part panel discussion and part training session on what steps are necessary to trade and what resources are available to traders to make informed decisions.

This isn't to necessarily sell you on anything.  It's to inform you so you can make better decisions for what is in your best financial future.  Any crypto tips or trading advice is strictly personal information and bias by participants.  The point isn't to tell you what to invest in, but more about how to invest in cryptos if you choose to do so.

## Hosts <h2>

I'll be joined by a few panel members to add some suggestions and places they go while making trades.

I have three  panelists confirmed:  @followbtcnews, @scaredycatguide and @choogirl.  I have two others invited that I'll update on later.

@followbtcnews is a day trader who moves money throughout the day.  He's a witness that supports the Minnow Support Project.
@scaredycatguide runs a radio show all about investing on msp-waves.  He has a book on bitcoin written, and is experienced in the space.
@choogirl is an Australian expat who has been living in a crypto tax haven of Panama and living off of her crypto investments.

## Logistics: Saturday Feb 3rd at 11am EST 1600 UTC <h2>

This is going to happen through screen sharing and webcams.  The live content will be broadcast through mspwaves.com/listen.  It will also happen in the [PALnet Discord Channel](minnowpond.org).

Show starts at 11am EST 1600 UTC.
