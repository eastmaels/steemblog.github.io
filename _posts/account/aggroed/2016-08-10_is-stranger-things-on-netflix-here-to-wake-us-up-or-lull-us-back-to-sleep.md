<p>Let me start off by saying Stranger Things is the show I've enjoyed watching more than any other I've ever watched.  It was suspenseful.  It was well written.  It had great graphics.  It was entertaining.  I couldn't ask for a better show... well almost.</p>
<p>2 things really bug me about it.  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>1.  They forced the Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas, the black kid) to hold the dress 11 was going to wear on top of his body.  While this seems inocuous enough there are a fair number of black celebrities that talk openly about how Hollywood seems to really want to <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/2013/11/05/emasculating-the-black-male-15-actors-who-wore-a-dress-for-success/" rel="noopener">emasculate black men</a>.  This doesn't doom the series or tell me that it's the most sinister thing in the world, but it was a red flag.</p>

<p><img src="//cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/590x/secondary/Eleven-597694.jpg" /></p>
<p>(I don't remember exactly where in the series he holds it up, but that's him and this is the dress he's psuedo wearing)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>2.  The thing that really bugged me was when I put this movie into context that I read on a blog I love reading called <a href="sitsshow.blogspot.com" rel="noopener">Stillness in the Storm</a>.  See, there appears to be this thing called a partial disclosure narrative.  Folks like David Wilcock like to talk about it.  It's where the Powers that Be know that because of the internet being the new Guttenberg press they have to back off the line in the sand they drew in terms of how much truth the everyday person would be exposed to.  The internet has been a spying bonanza for them, but it's also been a massive headache as now you can walk into a coffee shop and have a good chance you'll hear Illuminati, NWO, rothschild, 9/11, and a million other topics they'd rather you not talk about.</p>
<p>Anyway, so the cabal/Powers that Be have to put out stories that update people in terms of what they have been working on, but they like to do it in a way that simultaneously informs and misinforms people.  So, here we have Stranger Things.  They themselves pull up MKultra on the screen and let everyone know that 11/El is not just a runaway, but the product of a secret weapons program to weaponize the human brain especially in kids.  So, great, MKUltra, a thing I couldn't have spoken about with my statist friends before the series aired is now a thing and people are<a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=mkultra" rel="noopener"> googling it like never before</a>.  </p>
<p>Here's the rub.  Despite introducing MKUltra they have done it in a way to make it all look like fiction.  While I maintain there is some possibility the MKUltra team unearthed interdimensional headless monsters that kill people when they get the scent of blood I think it's more likely that they embedded this story about MKUltra with a make believe monster to discredit and undermine the mainstream disclosure of the program.  On the one hand they let everyone know MKUltra is a real thing and immediately trivialize it with the Demigorgon.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Anyway, that's my beef.  Great show.  Very entertaining.  Reveals a CIA black op project in a major way.  Puts it in a fictional world to down play what was really going on (and what is likely going on under a different name and a bigger budget).</p>
