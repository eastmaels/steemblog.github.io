<p>It seems as though all aspects of life are different in the Mandela Effect world. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.army.mil/values/oath.html">Here's </a>a link to the Army's Oath of Enlistment page.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Here's the Oath itself:</p>
<p>&nbsp;I, _____, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will <strong>support and defend</strong> the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God." (Title 10, US Code; Act of 5 May 1960 replacing the wording first adopted in 1789, with amendment effective 5 October 1962).&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>However, it appears a group of people also remember "uphold, protect, and defend" instead of "support and defend."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I haven't spent hours digging on this, but Smith and Wesson runs this <a href="https://www.smith-wesson.com/wcsstore/SmWesson/upload/popups/mp/images/Smith_Wesson_MP.pdf">ad</a>. &nbsp;Now, the challenge is always that when there is "reality residue" that there is the chance this is the cause rather than the symptom of the Mandela Effect. &nbsp;To me though, why would Smith and Wesson run an ad that specifically recites a Mandela Effect version of the Oath of Enlistment. &nbsp;It would make sense if it was the Oath, but now it seems off.<br>
<br>
Any vets out there? &nbsp;What do you remember?</p>
