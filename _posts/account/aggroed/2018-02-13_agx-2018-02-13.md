https://agx123.herokuapp.com//2018-02-13.jpg<br/><br/>This is the daily AgX chart for today 2018-02-13.<br/>Today's 200 day moving average is 0.95 for a STEEM/SBD ratio of 0.85.  <h3>What is AgX?</h3><br/><br/>The Mayer's multiple (the ratio of the 200 day moving average of the BTC/USD price to the current price) is known to be a good indicator of the BTC price evolution.
AgX aims to be a similar indicator regarding the STEEM/SBD ratio, in order for users to find the right moment to exchange their SBD for STEEM at the best possible rate.

Tough to resolve if it's laddering up and taking a dip, or if it's heading back to much higher sbd than steem.

AgX will get a new home in about week, and go off my wall and autovotes onto @agx.
