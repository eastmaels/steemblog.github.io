<p>In a rare interview with a small non-financial satirical news blog unread by 99.999999% of the world Warren Buffet was more than happy to sit down and have a frank discussion about the Wells Fargo <a href="http://sitsshow.blogspot.com/2016/09/major-problems-announced-at-one-of-the-largest-too-big-to-fail-banks-in-the-united-states.html">scandal</a>. &nbsp;Satirically Yours (SY) was thrilled to be able to talk with legendary investor Warren Buffet (WB).</p>
<p>SY: Mr. Buffet. &nbsp;Thank you so much for this opportunity. &nbsp;We are really thrilled to be able to have you on the program tonight?</p>
<p>WB: I'm sorry, who are you again?</p>
<p>SY: We're a division of Forbes magazine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>WB: Oh, well ok, I'm only doing this because a friend of my niece said she liked your content. &nbsp;You have 90 seconds. &nbsp;Then I have to get to the airport and&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sy: Great. &nbsp;2 days ago the story broke that Wells Fargo was experiencing some chaos as the result of 1.5 million fraudulent accounts being opened, fines being applied to those accounts, and general dissarray of the company.</p>
<p>WB: Yes well, Banking is a sector that has experienced some hardship in the past, but these companies are money makers and have sound financials. &nbsp;If you check the stock price you'll see that the small fine of <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/wells-fargo-fined-185-million-improper-account-openings-n645031">$185M</a> has not hurt the companies bottom line nor has it earned serious problems with investor confidence. &nbsp;Last time I checked we have only lost 2% of the company value, and have been able to eliminate <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/08/investing/wells-fargo-created-phony-accounts-bank-fees/">5,300 jobs</a>. &nbsp;Since many of those appear to have been unnecessary the company will likely see a large upward swing profit by this act alone.</p>
<p><img src="https://s16.postimg.org/kg7ihqgk5/wells_fargo.jpg" width="776" height="561"/></p>
<p>SY: We wonder if the reason investor confidence hasn't really been effected is a result of America's largest bank is in the hands of just a few institutional investors. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/wfc/institutional-holdings">5 companies own an approximate 30% stake</a>, and the top 9 companies: Berkshire Hathaways, Vangaurd, State Street, Wellington Management, Blackrock, Fidelity, JP Morgan Chase, Capital World Investors which have a combined stake of $73B in the company, and their subsidiaries own a significant portion as well.</p>
<p>WB: Yes, well, having a team of friendly investors to work with really does make everyone relax a little. &nbsp;I have the CEO of all those companies on speed dial and they have me on it too. &nbsp;We're all able to talk regularly about how the banking business is operating and I try to be an open book to them.</p>
<p>Sy: Yes, but don't you think that's creating a false sense of security in these companies? &nbsp;You're able to use your personal clout in the industry to assure institutional investors that everything is ok when in reality the bank has 5000 people that have been creating accounts.</p>
<p>WB: &nbsp;Who did you say you work with again? &nbsp;</p>
<p>SY: Bloomberg News.</p>
<p>WB: &nbsp;I'm going to call Michael about this. &nbsp;Look, 5,000 people in a company that employs 250,000 is a small percentage. &nbsp;It's less than 1%. &nbsp;This isn't across the board corruption. &nbsp;&nbsp;Firing all those people will probably save the company around $5B annually. &nbsp;We took a $185M hit for nearly constant fraud. &nbsp;We're calling this a win.</p>
<p>SY: &nbsp;The actions of those bankers are criminal. &nbsp;Do you think that any prison term will be served?</p>
<p>WB: Ok, this is your last question. &nbsp;I'm sure we'll find one or two people worthy of crimes, but I don't suspect many people will be in legal trouble. &nbsp;This is symptoms of an economy in recovery rather than going full speed ahead. &nbsp;As the economy improves these episodes at banks and other institutions will largely subside.</p>
<p>SY: <a href="http://archive.fortune.com/2009/04/19/news/companies/lashinsky_buffett.fortune/index.htm">6 years ago when you purchased a large stake in the bank after the financial crisis you said that banks were a good investment as long as they don't do dumb thing</a>s. &nbsp;Is this one of those dumb things?</p>
<p>WB: Sir. &nbsp;We are done.</p>
<p>WB nods at some of his friends.</p>
<p>--- At this point SY was blocked by a series of rather large and intimidating men as Buffet left the interview. &nbsp;We thank him for his generosity and time.</p>
