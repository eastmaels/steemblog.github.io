Hey Hey party people.  I'll be on the radio starting at 9pm hanging out with the lovely @swelker101 and @isaria.  We'll be talking about some good stuff to do on the blockchain as a new user on the system.  Maybe talk about some suggestions, and otherwise just blame Kevin for our problems.


## Peace Academy

Following the rousing conversation for Minnow University we'll switch gears into Peace Academy.  I'm betting it's a meandering conversation through some Meme the News topics, a smidge of peace, and maybe even some highly triggering conversations about judgements and maintaining/obtaining/declaring peace.

Should be fun!

## Logistics

Show starts on mspwaves.com/listen starting in 3 hours at 9pm EST.
You can listen in [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw)

You can chat in [Discord too](https://discord.gg/BS8WTzM)


## Tune in tomorrow on the Minnow Mayor Town Hall

Gonna go pretty in depth on the Gold Splinter to help the writing competition figure out what's going on.  Hopefully you'll attend or listen in later.  This should help you understand the full extent of what we're building with the writing competition for steem monsters.
