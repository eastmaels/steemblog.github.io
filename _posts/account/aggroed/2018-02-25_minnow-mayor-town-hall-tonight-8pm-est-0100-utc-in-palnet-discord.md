It's that time of the week again when we gather as friends and digital family to talk about what we're doing, what's going on in the crypto world, share news, promote people, projects, and ideas, and generally run amok.  It's time for the Minnow Mayor Town Hall!!!

So, the show format remains unchanged.  Everyone and anyone is welcome to come on the air and talk with me about whatever they would like.  I'll record it and put the post out and everyone can hear what you have come to talk about.

You could talk about a project.  @clayboyn does a good job of promoting the Make a Minnow project where through delegations provided by @eturnerx we award one minnows a 5,000 SP delegation for a month and get them some experience of being a dolphin and growing their influence and network.

You could talk about a project development.  @bait002 and @choogirl are nice examples of this where Bait spoke about the Steem Exchanger program that converts steem into African Fiat and back or @choogirl who spoke about Steemit World Map.

You are welcome to perform.  I've had a variety of musical presentations by the likes of @limabeing or @buckydurddle.  You're welcome to read a post or poem or play music.

Lastly, you can just introduce yourself.  If you're new to the community and you'd like some attention come on out and tell us who you are, what you do, and why you're doing it.

## Delegations <h2>

I'm almost to the point where I'll make the audience autovoter.  This means I'll be reducing or removing many of the personal delegations I've awarded.  I'm not entirely taking them away, I'm going to pool them into a central account, add at least 5000 SP, and start rewarding active participants in the Minnow Support Project PALnet Discord and MSP Waves rooms.

## Dice Bitches <h2>

We're playing Dice.  25 SBD up for grabs.  Odds are in my favor, so we'll play twice through. If I win once we'll play again, if I win twice we'll have a roll off for just the highest roll.

## Logistics <h2>

Show starts in around 6 hours at 8pm EST,. which is 0100 UTC.

You can join us in [The Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel](minnowpond.org).

I hope to see you there.  You can ask for help and get pointed in the right direction once you're in there.  It takes a second to get used to it.  There's a lot of stuff going on in there, but that's because we have over 14,000 Steemians there!

## Coming up <h2>
Gonna have a Artist of Steem panel on Saturday!
Gonna have a Boston meetup on Saturday!

Stay tuned!
