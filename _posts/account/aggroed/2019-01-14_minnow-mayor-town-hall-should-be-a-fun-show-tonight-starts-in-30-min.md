Show starts at 8pm est, which is 35 minutes from now.  It will be held in the PALnet discord room which you can visit at http://minnowpond.org.  We'll be in the mspwaves-audience room.

If you'd like to come on air there please bring a headset so you can speak clearly without it going back into the mic.
