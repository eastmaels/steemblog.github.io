It's Christmas time.  The snow may be falling where you are.  Children are excited for presents.  Parents are nervous about in-laws.  It's that most epicly stressful time of year where modern families come together and try to figure out peaceful coexistence while likely intoxicated.  Good times!

## Minnow Mayor Town Hall <h2>

Well, I'm still hosting my show.  I'll be on tonight at 8pm.  We'll talk with minnows and dolphins alike.  It's an open forum for folks, so you can introduce yourself, read something, perform, introduce a project, give a project update, and just talk about life on the block.  Only thing I ask is that if you have complaints it's better if you describe actions you don't like instead of people or companies you don't like.

## Show Logistics <h2>

You can also listen to us in the PALnet Discord channel: https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw

You will need a working mic and a headset if you want to participate on air. 


## Delegation <h2>

I'm going to suspend delegation this week.  My next delegation project is going to rearrange all of the individual delegations I've awarded and instead create a msp-audience account and do automatic votes to folks that show up and listen to the shows frequently.  More on that later, but this week I'm holding off on new delegations.

## Dice Bitches <h2>

We'll play Dice Bitches.  25 steem up for grabs.  I'll describe it on the show during Freebird!
