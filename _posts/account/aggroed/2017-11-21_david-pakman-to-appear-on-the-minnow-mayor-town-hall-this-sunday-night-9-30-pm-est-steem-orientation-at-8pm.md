This week I'm happy to announce week on the Minnow Mayor Town Hall we'll be having a special guest!  David Pakman of the David Pakman show will be stopping in.

## Minnow Mayor Town Hall <h2>

The show normally runs from 8pm-11pm EST (1:00 UTC).  This week 8-9 pm will be a Steem and PALnet Orientation.  Sometime around 9:30 or so David will stop in and we'll have a converstaion for 30 min to an hour discussing his first experience on the block, how his youtube audience is responding to his interest in the Crypto space, and where he and I can find some overlap in our interests in the world and help one another create some positive change.

If you'd like to listen in please join us in the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel this Sunday night by clicking here: https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy.
You can also listen in at mspwaves.com/listen.

## Steem Orientation this week! <h2> 

If you have some new people that need to learn the ropes and have questions about steem here's a great time to get an introduction to platform.  Join us in the channel sharply at 8pm to get a Witness and Educator breakdown of what is Steem what is a blockchain, and how the hell do you find success on the platform.

Then we'll switch to the Town Hall format around 9pm and catch David Pakman during it.
