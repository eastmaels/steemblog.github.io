![Witness Forum.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUMFihQQ2E5sg6scynuvW7f6DVmi3byJYrGPqC44f7u4x/Witness%20Forum.png)

Hey all.  One of the best things that I think I do for this platform is help get my fellow witnesses out of their man caves and into the spotlight a little to talk about what they are working on, the state of the network, and what are the good and bad things that we need to address as a broader community.  Part of that is having @andrarchy on the show who is the Director of Content for Steemit Inc.  He usually starts off the show by talking about some of what Steemit has been up to and a little insight into the water cooler discussions there.

## Guests
@andrarchy
@roelandp
@lukestokes
@pharesim
@aggroed
@jerrybanfield

I have two maybes with @jesta and @yabapmatt (the backup witness for this).

I'm expecting another great conversation.

## Logistics

Show starts at 11 am EST (1500 UTC)
Show happens in [The Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel](minnowpond.org)

You can also listen live at mspwaves.com/listen

## A note about PALnet
If you've never been in PALnet before please make sure you register.  Registration costs 0.001 steem, which is returned to you.  You'll get an automated message with instructions.  Registration unlocks your ability to speak in the channels.

## Guests

Please make sure you come a little early to get audio checked.  It's important you don't have sounds from your speakers entering into your mic.

When you arrive head into the "waiting room" and we'll check your audio and then you'll get dragged live on air.  You'll be placed on mute while music plays (so you may want to listen on mspwaves.com/listen until the formally starts at 11am EST)

## PALnet rules
You are welcome to express any thought you have regarding anything discussed, but you're not allowed to be purposefully antagonistic about it.  You have a whole internet to act however you want.  We enforce some decorum.  All thoughts are allowed, but not all presentations of the thought.  Find a way to express frustration in a healthy way if that's what you're choosing to share and be prepared to be kicked if you can't do that with civility.  That includes while you are talking to Steemit employees, witnesses, and guests in the chatroom.

## Recordings 

I'll make a recording available.  I'll put it on the previous post, this post, and a post I write after the forum with some notes about the forum.  Feel free to share or simply copy the youtube links and put around the web however you choose to do so.

## Witnessing

Hosting these conversations are part of my ongoing witness project, and the projects that the witnesses discuss are part of their ongoing witness projects.  If you hear things that you think add value to the network please consider adding your votes to the guests.

If you're unclear on what a witness is or does I recently wrote a post about [it here](https://steemit.com/witness/@aggroed/aggroed-what-s-a-witness-what-s-in-a-block)
