The Mayor of Minnow Town is going on air TONIGHT in just under 9hrs from the time of this post.  From 9pm-11pm EST (New York City time) the Steemian known as Aggroed will undergo his transformation into.... SKANKYJ!!!

## Show Format <h2>

It's week three of the call-in show format.  You are welcome to hop into the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network on Discord, which is home to the Minnow Support Project.  You can find a direct link on the @minnowsupport wall.  Everyone is welcome to take 5 min with me on air.  You can ask me anything you want, and I'll give you my honest answer.  You can promote things.  You can blab on air.  That's all ok.

You're also welcome to ask me the hard stuff.  Just be careful.  This is "Do no Harm, but **TAKE NO SHIT**" land.  You're welcome to talk about whatever, but just be prepared to stop after "I don't consent" and if you can't then just be prepared to get dissected.

## Delegation and going on air<h2> 
As per usual I'll be delegating away 250 SP.  All you have to do to be eligible is to come on the air with me.  You will need a headset and a mic.  You'll come into PALnet and hang out in general voice channel "Waiting-Room" and then I'll drag you onto my show.  Please don't speak right away.  When I drag you in music will likely be playing, which you probably can't hear.  Wait for me to speak to you to introduce you.  While in the waiting test talking to eachother.  That way you know your mic, and push to talk button is working.  Lastly, when you're on my show make sure you have the mspwaves.com/listen down or off.  Since you don't want the infinite loop playing.

OK, so to be eligible for the delegation just hop on air with me, say some stuff, and add your name to this list -

After that you just wait.  At the end of the show i'll do a die roll.  On a 1 the delegation gets pushed out a week.  Otherwise someone gets it.  You can keep the delegation until you have 5ksp and then you have to give it back so another minnow can get it.  If you'd prefer I give it to someone else that's not a problem.

**Delegations have a maximum life span of 6 months from me (this is new), so you can have a long time, but not hold onto them forever.**

## Dice Bitches <h2>

We'll play some dice bitches.
I roll.  If you tie or beat you can stay in.
I roll again, same deal.  We play until only 1 person is left standing.
If I win We will play again.  If you win I'll send you 25SBD.

If we run out of time or I win twice in a row I'll send the money to @msp-waves.
