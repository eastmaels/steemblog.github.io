Steem will keep dropping as long as the whales keep selling and there aren't enough people buying.  Since the overall volume on poloniex is like 200 btc ($16k) and the amount that the big accounts are powering down in $114k worth the price will go down.  In the short term this will drive the price down, BUT!!!  This will drive some bloggers out and will reduce the overall market cap of this place.  So, it's going to get worse.  Then in about 3 months many of the big power downs will end and the price will be pretty low I imagine 1 cent or so.  Then some people will look around and say "Hey, the power downs stopped, the price isn't dropping any more, this is a good time to buy!"  Then lots of people will buy, and as people buy the price will go up, and people will be attracted, and I imagine this place will be booming again.  

This hinges on the whales keep selling.  If they don't sell on the cheap then it won't redistribute, and if it doesn't redistribute you won't get the gains in number of people in the system, which means you won't see the price rise.  Hell, even if they don't sell and just power down there is going to be a shit ton of steem hangin' around and that will drive the price as much or more as actually selling it.

Hang on to your hats it's gonna be a rough couple of months.  Stay calm and buy low.
