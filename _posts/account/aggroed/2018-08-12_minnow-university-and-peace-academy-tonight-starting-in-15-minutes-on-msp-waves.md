Ok party people!  It's that time again!  It's time for Minnow University and the Peace Academy.

On Minnow University we'll be focusing on Minnows!  The goal is to provide some helpful advice on how to grow your account on the Steem Blockchain.  This is of course in the scope of the Minnow Support Project where we strive to spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, help the steem ecosystem grow, and train and retain new members on the platform!

Speaking of Peace we'll have the Peace Academy right after.  We'll be talking about finding balance during troubled times, dabbling in some interesting news articles of late, and generally learning how not to be an asshole.

## Logistics

Find us on mspwaves.com/listen.  We'll have a dlive stream go up through @msp-waves.

You can also catch us on Discord through the largest off chain Discord group ie the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network.  You can find the proper Discord url on the @minnowsupport page or just check us out at minnowpond.org

See you in a few minutes live on air!

PS there's this guy named Kevin.  He'll be there too.  I think his lovely wife Isaria will be there too!
