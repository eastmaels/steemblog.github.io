Ok, so a brand new 20kW generator is pretty expensive.  It's like $4k or more after pad and electrical are included.  I'm also nervous about what happens to a brand new generator if we modify it for GEET.  So, my current plan is to buy an oversized 20kW generator and get it running on propane.  My house draws like 16 amps.  So, this is pretty large compared to what I need, but that's ok.  I'll just get asics to feed it.  Hopefully my wife won't kill me cause while it's on propane I'm expecting this baby will be quite loud.

Ok, so first we'll get it going so we can test out what it draws.  Considering it's 10 years old and might need more fuel than what the docs say it will that background testing will help us.  It may get me truly in dog house for noise, but we gotta figure out what it costs to run before we GEET it. 

My plan is to make a pad, get R0n to get the setup ready for connection, get the connection going, measure the draw, and then GEET'er done (hopefully I'll get @geetrofits to come down and tweak this baby), and then test what it does when we're using propane/nat gas, and then lastly switch to water and see how that goes.
