Alrighty, check in starts in 1 hour for a legendary summoners battle tonight.  You can find the challonge here: https://challonge.com/dwevakbp.  The steemmonsters account has 80 of these summoners so, I plan on doing at least 8 tournaments with them.  

It also has a few GFL Summoners... I'll have to think of what to do with those next week.  Maybe a raffle...

There's only 16 people or so signed up.  So if you want an easy shot at some legendary summoners you'll want to be there.

## Tomorrow!  Steem Alliance

![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmXV4r3YUdh5vqqTUicYhh1yZbbz3fAzYmz5SgHzCJ7Sko/image.png)

at 1pm est, 1800 UTC I'm going to host a 1 hour radio show to start talking about proposal design stuff.  The plan is to talk less about any specific ideas of the design itself and more to clarify some of what's going on and some of the topics that have already been identified that should go into a good design.

## Tomorrow's Steem Monsters Tournaments

I'm hosting a bunch of gold foil tournaments tomorrow for 1,000 steem worth of monsters.  I haven't bought them off the market, but that's likely to happen tonight during this evening's tournament.

Anyway, by 2pm it's time to gather in the steem monsters tournament discord and we'll be battling it out for a while there.  Should be fun!
