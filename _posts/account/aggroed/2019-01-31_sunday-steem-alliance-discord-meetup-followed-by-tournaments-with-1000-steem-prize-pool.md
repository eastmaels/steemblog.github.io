Sunday is a busy day for me filled with Steem Alliance and Steem Monsters.

At 1pm est (1800 UTC) I'm going to host a radio show in PALnet to talk about foundation designs, concerns, concepts, stakeholder groups etc.  Anyone is welcome to attend.  Think of it as a brainstorming session of all the things that should be considered when putting together a future proposal.  That said I'm not on the working group, so I can't tell you exactly how it will be run, only that they're trying to collect ideas and buy-in from the whole community.

## Steem Monsters Tournaments

Immediately following that I'm going to run some tournaments.  I've set aside 1000 steem and I'll buy buying leveled monsters over the next few days.  Players will earn monsters as their prizes!

2pm EST we'll do a gold foil novice level limits tournament for 100 steem of monsters
3pm EST we'll do a gold foil bronze level limits tournament for 300 steem of monsters
4pm EST we'll do a gold foil gold level limits tournament for 600 steem of monsters

These tournaments will take place in the SM tournament discord- https://discord.gg/CBfjFSr
