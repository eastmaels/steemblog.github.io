Well, holy crap.  This was the longest show I've done.  We went from 8pm to midnight EST.  I'm exhausted, but people have stories and I'm trying to get them out into the world.

I'm not sure this is a complete list, but here's who came on the show-

@wandrnrose7 (former Make a Minnow Winner and active minnow in PALnet)
@rodeo670 (future radio show host, singer, and Greeter for PALnet/MSP)
@clayboyn (jr moderator, philosopher, poet, and sexy voice master of cuddles)
@intuitivejakob (Formerly dead, and came back from it with some pretty wild stories and viewpoints to share from it)
@kubbyelizabeth (she promises to read aggrotica and turn it into kubrotica!)
@limabeing (talented singer, manager of the girl power server)
@pennsif (web developer and internet community builder)
@yabapmatt (top 50 witness, manager of the Steem Bot Tracker, and creator of the post promoter bot)
@sunravelme (aka sunravageme, talented writer, MAM winner, and lovely lady extraordinaire)
@rhondak (Cofounder of the Writer's Block with @gmuxx)
@r0nd0n (station manager for mspwaves, sr moderator, and @freezepeach owner and operator)
