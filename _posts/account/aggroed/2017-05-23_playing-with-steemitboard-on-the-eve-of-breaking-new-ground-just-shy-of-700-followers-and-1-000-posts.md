I can feel the anticipation!  I'm sitting at 697 followers.  I'm sitting at 994 posts!  I think of those as two major milestones!

Right around 700 followers will put me in the top 200 authors!

1,000 posts will put me in the top 570.

## Steemitboard <h2>
So, after following back a new passenger on the Aggroed follow train @mikey94 she posted something about the steemitboard.  
https://steemit.com/steenitboard/@mikey94/my-steemitboard-3

I glanced at her post quickly, but as I was thinking about how to track my progress since September it actually seems pretty cool.

You can do your own at steemitboard.com.  You don't have to sign in.  Here's a direct link to my steemitboard.

## I started with nothing back in September <h2>
So, I think this is pretty good progress.  It's pretty crazy that this past week has been a major one for me.  I rocked out about 350 followers just this week!!!  I have a few hundred in rewards coming my way.  My account is creeping up to $10k value.  I've spent hours working on this "business," but most of the time it's been fun... so, it didn't and it doesn't feel like a chore.

Actually, when people interact with me I find it personally really rewarding.  I'm really honored and stoked that so many people upvoted my "Explain steemit like I'm 5" post.  I'm really touched that @moormanclan decided to write posts to their kids because of my gifting post.

Honestly, I didn't know how fun or cool it would be to have so many people interact with these posts.  I'm really grateful you're all here and thanks for taking the time to read my stuff.  I hope you find it entertaining and find some nuggets worth keeping.

<3 Aggroed
