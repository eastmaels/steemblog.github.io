<p>By her own admission Clinton suffers from pneumonia. &nbsp;Her personal doctor (as opposed to a third party observer) <a href="https://m.hrc.onl/secretary/10-documents/05-physician-letter/HRC_physician_letter.pdf">released medical records</a>. &nbsp;For the anti-vaccine crowd it's a wonderful gem. &nbsp;A fully vaccinated person is now suffering from the illness the vaccine is meant to protect. &nbsp;The vaccine can be thought of as a potential cause or incapable of preventing the very illness it's designed to protect against. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Vaccine inserts go into a lot of detail into problems caused by vaccines. &nbsp;They include neurological damage including but not limited to autism. &nbsp;For those that don't believe me, go to your doctors office and keep insisting that you see the long form version of the insert that comes with the vaccine and sit down and read it. &nbsp;Under potential risks it will list autism among other issues.</p>
<p>Here's a current, profound, and ironic example of vaccine "failure" in that a big pharma mega donor recipient is &nbsp;either brought down by or failed to be protected by the vaccines she supports.</p>
