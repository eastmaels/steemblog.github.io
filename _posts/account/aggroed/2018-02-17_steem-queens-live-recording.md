Hello all.  I present to you the Steem Queens show broadcast from earlier today.  It was a very fun and thoughtful show with some very entertaining ladies that have created awesome content, communities, programs, and businesses.  I was stoked to participate!

## Guests in order <h2>

@allasyummyfood starts us off by talking about creating a food, fitness, and beginner to crypto blog.  
@crimsonclad shares about building community through Discord and it's links to Steem.
@patrice talks about her desire to elevate valuable original content by reducing rewards on spam and pirated content.  She discusses Steemcleaner and starting her witness.
@rhondak talks about making her start in the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network home of the Minnow Support Project and then outgrowing the space.  It served a great role as an incubator and helped collect critical mass to start the writer's block!  

We then open it up to a general discussion and folks talk about their experience on the block and describe what it takes to build success here.  There's a general discussion about being a woman on the block, but it seems to boil down mostly to hard work and vision end up building an audience and that moral isn't genital specific.

## Crazy world <h2>

@surfermarly had a friend emergency pop up
@gringalicious had a travel emergency
@stellabelle had a medical emergency
@beanz was a no show

The universe unfolds and I just try to roll with it, but it seems like that in March or April I'll try Steem Queens 2: Reloaded.
