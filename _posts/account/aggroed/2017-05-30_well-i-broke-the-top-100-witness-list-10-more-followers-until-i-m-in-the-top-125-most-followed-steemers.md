Ok,  Great start to the campaign.  I formally launched 3 hours ago and I'm already in 93rd position!  Considering that as many as 30 of these might not even be functional it puts me closer to 63 in some ways.  You can find the list here: https://steemdb.com/witnesses.  You can find me here- https://steemdb.com/@aggroed

I've had some excellent discussions.  I'm already getting a stronger sense of how these things work.  I'm getting a better sense of the some of positions of existing Witnesses.  I'm also formulating thoughts on rules regarding Witnesses.

## Thank you!!! <h2>

So, first off!  Giant thanks to those that supported me with their Witness Vote, resteems, and upvotes!  That's awesome!  This is a giant learning experience and I'm stoked to be going through it.

Secondly, I'm standing by my first thought of when SBDs are over $1USD ramp the printing press.  It allows growth, it shorts mooning, which is better for a fair distribution, and it helps newbies and merchants. It doesn't hurt holders of the SBDs, but it doesn't help them either.  It makes it a poor store of value, but a higher utility medium of exchange.

Thirdly, I think we should institute term limits for Witnesses.  As folks stay in the top 19 spots there should be a penalty applied to their total Vote count (it's calculated in vests, so I'm thinking after two years we should apply a 1/365 penalty for every 4 days they are in the top 19, and they should regain it at the same rate when they aren't in it).  We want lots of voices, and time to complete things, but we don't want the same people in there indefinitely.  

Thanks for your support.
