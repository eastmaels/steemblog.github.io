# 5 Techniques to Develop and Improve Emotional Intelligence

Emotional Intelligence isn’t something we either have or don’t have. It can be developed.  Improving your level of emotional intelligence can help in all areas of your life. It can create success in a business sense and peace in your personal relationships.

### Observation 
Take a deep and honest look at yourself and your relationships.  Do you find that you are often in conflict with others?  Are you quick to anger or do you rush to judgement? Do you find yourself often blaming others for your problems?
Awareness and acceptance of our own issues is necessary in order to change.  
Try viewing things from another perspective, try to be accepting of other’s perspectives, and try to take ownership of conflicts and problems in your life.

### Confident Humility
Do you find that you are often seeking attention and praise?  
Are you constantly comparing yourself to others?
Take a look at your accomplishments and be proud.
You can confidently state your achievements in a quiet way without demanding attention or trying to take attention away from someone else.
Allow others to have a chance to shine.  Their moment in the Sun doesn’t take away from your own accomplishments.

### Reactions to Stress
Managing and controlling emotions is key to stress management.
This involves controlling anger, emotional outbursts, and taking time to cool down when you are feeling emotionally raw.
This is a highly valued skill in work environments and brings stability to personal relationships.


---

### Taking Responsibility
Take responsibility for your words and actions. Don’t be too proud to apologize when you have hurt someone. 


---


### Thinking Before you Speak or Act 
Our decisions, words, and actions can all affect other people.  Try putting yourself in their shoes and think about how you would feel in their place before you speak or act.
