As part of my witness mission to increase the user base of Steemit and help onboard minnows I've put together a PPT presentation.  I hope that over the coming weeks and months I can use this to talk to professors and college students about Steemit.  The goal is to define what Steemit it, present what the problems are with other approaches,  show how Steemit solves them, and give a little product demonstration.  I do this stuff professionally, so I'm have high hopes it will go over well.

## The appraoch <h2>
1. Create an email template
2. Email some profs in New England ask if I can speak to their class about Steemit.  English, journalism, economics, and computer science are all high on my list of courses to target.
3.  Go drive there or do a webex to show them this deck, answer questions, and hopefully onboard some college peeps.
4.  Additionally, use my youtube audience to put this out there as a screencast for folks not in college that may want to learn about this platform and this community.

Actually I have 300k airline miles from work... I could travel to do this on a roadshow if need be.

## Your role <h2>
