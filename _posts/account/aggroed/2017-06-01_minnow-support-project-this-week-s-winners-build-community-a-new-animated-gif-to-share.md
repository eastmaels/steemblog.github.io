Hello Minnows!
I recently hit 1,000 followers and broke into the top 125 authors on Steemit. It had a lot to do with @kaylinart and @fyrstikken resteeming one of my posts. 
it got me thinking...

What if I could help my followers like @kaylinart and @fyrstikken helped me!?! It's pretty easy to do. All I have to do is resteem my followers! What if I could get them a reward too!?!  And the Minnow Support Project was born!
## What are the rules? <h2>
For every 100 upvotes I'll resteem a follower's post
To be able to get a resteem simply link your post (or a referral if you want) in the comments section. Make sure there are at least 3 days left on the post rewards because I'm not going to resteem until Thursday.
The first resteem is the post that gets the most upvotes.
The second resteem is the post I think is best based on a criteria of promoting Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.
Third and up are based on upvotes as well.
Getting upvoted by bots doesn't count.
## What counts as a minnow? <h2>
If you have less than 500 followers and less than 5,000SP at the time you post then you're a minnow that's eligible for the resteem and the reward!

## I have a few extra resteems I'll do throughout the day!  <h2>

Here are some notable resteems I'll do to help out as well!

## I want to help @theprophet0 <h2>

So, he's the youngest Steemer we have on the witness list.  He's a minnow.  He wants to go to STEEMFEST.  I think he's a great candidate to support!  So, I recently announced a $200 SBD gift to the travel fund.  I'm going to ask that it goes to @theprophet0.  He's putting out a crowd funding campaign so I'm including that here too.  So, check him out and help him out.
