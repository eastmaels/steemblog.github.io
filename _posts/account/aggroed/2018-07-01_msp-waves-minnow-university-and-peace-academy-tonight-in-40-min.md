I'm going on air again.  I have the Top 20 Witness Forum from earlier uploading as we speak.  I'm getting ready for this evenings shows.  I hope you are enjoying the nice little price spike that's happening right now.  If you'd like to lock in some profits you may choose @steemmonsters and steemmonsters.com packs.  Buy for yourself, a friend, or that special someone in your life.  Good times!

## Last week's Peace Academy

I have a hard time posting this one.  Just haven't felt the uumph.  It's a show that we did that includes some controversial subject matter of vaccines.  The point of the show wasn't to have a vaccine discussion.  The point of the show was to talk about a controversial topic and find a peaceful way to do it.  All too often we are happy to shut down others before they speak.

"Any fucking idiot want to address why vaccines can be good for you?"

That's hyperbole that wasn't spoken on the show, but that kinda approach doesn't lend itself to constructive conversation.  It shuts down the other person and shows that you have no respect for them or their opinion before the conversation even starts.  If we want to have good discussions around controversial topics we hvae to start by being in a space where we can hear and respect other opinions

## The Peace Academy

There's a reason that we have A Peace, Abundance, and Liberty network but only offer a Peace Academy.  It's the hardest of those three to get.  It's usually not that hard to get out of a self-defeating scarcity mindset.  It's usually not that hard to realize that you should be free.  Many people don't even have rudamentary understandings of what it means to be peaceful.  We're here to help.

## Logistics

I'm too sleepy to do this justice.  Just hop into PAlnet through minnowpond.org someone will route you there.

We broke Discord with the big Top 20 Witness forum.  So, if you were there earlier and want to watch this too than just open it through a browser and all should be ok.
