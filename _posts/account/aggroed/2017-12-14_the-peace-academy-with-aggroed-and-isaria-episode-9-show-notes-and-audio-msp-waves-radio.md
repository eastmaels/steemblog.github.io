# <center> The Peace Academy with @aggroed and @isaria // Episode 9 Show Notes and Audio //  Msp-Waves Radio </center>



---



Weâ€™ve spent many episodes discussing the concept of Peace and how we can implement it within our community, and we spent a few episodes talking about Liberty and the truth of the world in which we live.
In our last episode we focused on Abundance as many of us are feeling it with the current spike of SBD!

# <center> Show Highlights  </center>

* The amazing opportunity that Steemit has given all of us to create abundance within our lives.

* The goal of continuing to build the MSP community to help people achieve success in a faster time frame.

* Why we should let the price of SBD rise.

* The distribution on steem is that the top 1% own 93% of it so if we allow this spike of SBD it will benefit the active community of 30,000 steemians who are posting which is a much healthier form of distribution.
