Going live in 5 minutes for a Monster Mayor Town Hall.  We just launched public fighting.  I'm sure there are lots of questions.  I'll have a new page to show here too that can explain different parts of battle.  We'll go over basic questions and talk about the game, gameplay, and what this means for Steem.

I've gotten some feedback on the game, we'll cover that.

I've gotten one request for RC help.  I'll talk about that too.

Anyway, we're live on mspwaves.com/listen and in minnowpond.org in 3 minutes.
