So, I know Steem Monsters is cool, but I didn't expect this level of reaction in the first week on the alpha.  I barely mentioned it last week on Minnow Mayor Town Hall last Sunday and in this past week the community has purchased 1.3k of SBD worth of monsters and 710 Steem of Monsters!  Y'all are Monster crazy!!!  I think we're going to hit $4000 USD sold in the first week before the show goes live.  It's awesome.

@yabapmatt and I are really excited about this game, and honestly only more so because the Steem community seems to get our vision and where we're going with it.  We're both witnesses that believe in Steem and to echo many of the other top 20 witnesses on the Steem blockchain that came on the Forum yesterday the goal is to add value to the Steem Blockchain.  We want to entertain people.  We want to enrich people.  We want people to have fun with this.  So far so good.

It's funny.  I was just nudging Andrarchy about getting product out there, and already I'm feeling it.  Folks are wondering when the guilds start, when trading starts, when the fighting starts, how combinations start, we've had 1-2 missed purchases and we're looking into it.  The best part though is that over and over you guys keep saying "this is awesome" "I love Steem"  "this is soooo coooool!"  I'm stoked that you're stoked.

## What's up next?

We're working on combining cards to level them faster, a couple of UI changes, we're setting some of the skill points and abilities, we're going to get the trading functional, we have a Discord and we'll get some informal teams started in there, and of course the fighting.

I'm been asked about a couple different promotional opportunities, I've been asked about coding work, I've been asked about price breaks for large purchases, I've been asked about Whitepapers and investments.  Honestly, it's been a bit of a hectic day!!!

The short answer is I'm not entirely sure.  I figured we'd mosey along with this and that eventually it would pick up steam.  I didn't expect it to be a hit overnight.  We don't have a plan in place for this level of success just yet!

So... the goal is to talk about Steem Monsters.  See what you all want, give out some packs, and hopefully have @yabapmatt join us for a discussion about it too.

## Investment
At the moment we're not looking for investors in the project.  That may be subject to change later, but we have an income stream already in excess of our bills.  So, honestly right now we don't need it.

## White paper

I'm not sure what to do about this.  I've been asked for it a few times.  I tend to think it's an investment thing... I'll be putting some posts together that dive into the math of how the game will play, but I don't think we're going to white paper this baby.  Again, we have income in excess of our needs.  I don't think we need a white paper as much as some nerdy documents on the @steemmonsters account.

## Giveaway
I'm planning on giving away packs.  Technically I'll be giving away SBD from the @steemmonsters, but hopefully you'll turn around and use it to buy Steem Monster booster packs.  I'm planning on giving away 5 sets of 10 SBD on the show.  Some to brand new users, some to people that can show legendaries, some that have written a post or blogged about it.  I don't know.  I'll come up with ideas as we go.  I think Steem monsters meets Dice Bitches will be epic.

If you win and don't want the monsters I'm happy to give you SBD, but would only provide half as much.

## Supporting the chain

My plan is also to donate 25-50 SBD to the open mic prize pool.  I'm also planning on sending some weekly donations to @suzi3d.  That lady is hard as nails and seems to be in a bind.  She's worth it!

## Other guests- YOU

As per normal people are welcome onto the Minnow Mayor Town Hall to shoot the shit, ask some questions, try to promote something, perform, introduce themselves or whatever.  Ask me stuff as a witness, I can interview you as a guest.  I don't care.  It's a townhall and I'll change what I do to meet whatever your needs are.

Two rules.  Make sure sounds from the speakers don't go into the mic.
If you're gonna hit me, the community, Steemit, or MSP with some griefing please do it respectfully.


## Logistics
