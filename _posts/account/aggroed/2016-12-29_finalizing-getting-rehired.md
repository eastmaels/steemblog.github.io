So, what could have really sucked (getting my position eliminated) might actually be a nice treat.  I'm getting a few months of severance and got a new job before it even started.  They are also giving me a signing bonus.  So, looks like I'm ahead tens of thousands.  Life could be worse.  Gotta wait and see to make sure it all comes through as planned.
