# Metcalfe's law

  
We started the show with a discussion about Abundance!
In 2 months Steemit doubled the amount of active daily users from 30,000 to 60,000 which is an amazing amount of growth!  

  

The idea behind Metcalfe's law is that a telecommunication network’s value is proportionally squared based on its amount of active users.

  
So, in theory, if Steemit doubles the amount of users again, then the value of Steem should quadruple.  You can read about that [here](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/bitcoin-mayer-multiple/).

  


Some users are concerned about what effect so many new users will have on the reward pool, but the growth will have a positive outcome.

More users will decrease the amount of steem that we each get, but the value of that steem will increase, as will our SBD payouts.

# Minnow Support Resteem Contest

  

The Minnow Support Resteem contest is the longest running resteem contest on Steemit.

The Minnow Support Project started 8 months ago and we’ve had an amazing amount of growth during that time!  

The Steemit account and the Palnet Discord both have over 13,000 members!

One of the biggest ways you can grow on Steemit is through resteems.  Having your blog resteemed on an account like Minnow Support that has a large amount of active followers can help you get more followers, which in turn helps you to generate more sustainable revenue in the long run.

predictive programming

disinformation formulas

engineered events

technological mind control techniques
