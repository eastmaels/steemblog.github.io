Man, every day I feel like I just get busier.  Ok, well, it's almost 9pm, and the Steem Town Hall is going to start in 10 minutes.  So, hop into the PALnet Discord at https://minnowpond.org or visit us at mspwaves.com/listen.

## Format

This is a town hall hosted by me and @llfarms.  If you'd like to come on air and talk about something you're welcome to.  You can promote yourself, a project, a post, perform, or do whatever.  It's an open format to give airtime to Steemians to talk about what they think is important.

If you'd like to be on air attach a mic and headset to your comp and put a `1` into chat.  We'll get you live.
