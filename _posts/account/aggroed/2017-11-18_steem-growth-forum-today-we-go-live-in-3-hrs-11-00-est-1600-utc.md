We all have a vested interest in growing this platform.  More users = higher valuation.  Do you want your share of the pay to be worth more?  Then let's grow the steem ecosystem!  We're starting that discussion as a group today in just about 3 hours!

 
## Steem Growth Forum <h2>

Let's get this kicked off internally and pull together some of the biggest names on the platform for a few hours and ask them all to talk about what growth looks like to them.  How do we achieve it?  What will limit it?  How do we remove those limitations?  How do we help this place.  This is a little bit like herding cats right now, but it starts by having a collective discussion and going from there.

We know HF20 Velocity and SMTs are coming and those innovations can elevate the Steem platform from one of the best platforms to the single best platform to spend your attention on.  We have a limited window of opportunity to take massive interest and attention in crypto right now and convert it into users and a higher value token.  How are we going to do that?

## Who is on air? <h2>
Come have this discussion.  If you're a whale (50k SP+), a Steemit employee, a top 30 witness, a follower whale (5,000 followers+) or host a large Discord community (500 people+) we're happy to have you come on the live broadcast.  I'll add in if you have a rep over 70 you are welcome to join on air too.  

## Who is participating <h2>

If you're not one of those you're welcome to join us the Discord chat room and type in questions in general, pose questions to speakers, or submit some ideas.  Those interactions are recorded .  You'll get a chance to add your voice to this, it just won't be live on air this go round.  You may want to take notes and post about this afterward.  I'll be looking to resteem and curate folks that engage here and talk about what some community leaders said.

## Format <h2>

We'll take a quick poll at the beginning of the show and see who wants to start us off (looking at you @andrarchy).  Folks that want to speak will enter a 1 in chat.  They'll get logged in order on a spreadsheet.  We'll go through the spreadsheet and talk to steem influencers.  I'll have a 5 min timer and let people go.  After the first round we'll collect names again and potentially expand the participation rules depending on who is there and who else wants to speak.  In full transparency I promised @stellabelle an early participation.

This is my first forum like this.  I founded and help manage the Minnow Support Project.  You can bet your ass I'll be hosting some forums for minnows too.  It's just not today.  So, hang tight and I'll work on a schedule so many people can lend their voice.

## Voice chat needs<h2>
So you want to talk?  That's great.  Please test your headphones and mic before coming on air.  We have voice channels called waiting rooms.  That's a great place to make sure you're ready.  I can pull you on air from the waiting room.

## Community Standards and Rules <h2>

These will be in effect during the broadcast.  If you can't abide by some fairly simple rules you'll be shown the door.  This isn't a forum for you to flame.  If you have some constructive criticisms they'll be welcome.  If you're there to target people or Steemit we'll have a bunch of our moderators ready to swing the ban hammer.  

Steemit Inc is filled with passionate people doing their best.  It's unfortunate they aren't moving as quickly as you may like, but from my 10 years experience in publishing these folks are moving at lightening speed.  There's been 18 hardforks in a year and a half and the chain hasn't split.  Cut them some slack.  We're making progress.  I'm a fan of these guys and I'm happy to kick/ban folks that just come in here hoping to flame them.

Good Critisism:  I would like a better looking UI let me show you a suggestion.
Bad Criticism: Why can't you shits make a fucking UI that doesn't suck.

You can find the basics of what you need to know about our community here: https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy.

## Logistics<h2> 
The Moderated discussion will take place at 11AM EST (this is NYC time) Saturday November 18. This I believe is 16:00 UTC time. I will moderate the discussion.

It will take place in the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord channel: https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy

The Minnow Support Project has created a streaming internet radio station called mspwaves. We'll broadcast the event live and save a recording for the block later.

Typed in questions and discussion by the audience will happen here: https://discord.gg/BS8WTzM
You can listen to the show in the PALnet discord room here: https://discord.gg/pGHjVtc
You can listen to the show live on air at mspwaves.com/listen.

## I'm looking forward to more of these already <h2>

The next forum I have in mind is the Crypto Growth Forum.  I want to pull together leaders from a variety of other crypto communities and get them all talking on air about their space and how we can all grow it.  The fight doesn't have to be crypto vs crypto.  I think many of us are in the crypto space for similar reasons and the more cross over between platforms we have the better we'll be.  If Steemit is the main communication hub between them then that would be spectacular.

As I plan that I'll also get some forums going for minnows and dolphins that want to share some thoughts on the platform.

## We'll see you in 3 hours and we can't wait! <h2>
