Following a disastrous debate performance many Americans wondered "WTF is wrong with Tim Kaine?"  The answer didn't take long to surface.

Guccifer 2.0 hacks also included a note by his doctor indicating a serious medical condition similar to Joe Biden and many other gaffe prone vice presidential picks.

"Kaine is unable to sit quietly without interrupting others.  Childhood diagnosis was ADHD, but given the frequency and types of outburst a more likely diagnosis is Tourette's syndrome."  Dr. Spechemen.

Tourette's syndrome is often responsible for involuntary ticks, incoherent speech, and inappropriate conversational mannerisms.  It appears the Democratic ticket this election cycle continues to be plagued with grave medical concerns.
