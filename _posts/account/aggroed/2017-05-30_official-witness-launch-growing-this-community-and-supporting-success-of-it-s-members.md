Fellow Steemers,

## The day has come when I formally announce my witness run!  <h2>

I'm so happy and excited to get to launch this campaign.  Together we can work on growing this community and helping the newest members become successful.  We all want this site and platform to grow so that it's message can resonate across the internet and make an impact in your daily life.  I value Peace, Abundance, and Liberty and with your help; others who share those values and learn those values will come here and stay here!

The world is run by immoral banksters that cause us all harm.  Through spreading technology that loosens their monopoly on money creation we free ourselves from their shackles.  It's imperative that we work together to spread Steemit to others and help this platform grow.  That's why I'll dedicate my time, energy, and focus as a Witness to the growth of Steemit!

For many on the Witness list they see this role as programming new apps and widgets that give new features to the product.  It's a wonderful contribution.  This platform wouldn't be where it is today without it.  However, at it's current stage and size the Steemit platform has evolved enough so that one new feature or tweak to the platform isn't going to cause a mass migration here.  *We're not limited by the tools at hand, but by the number of people who know how to wield them and why they should.*

This platform's message will spread by rallying our community around new people, showing them the ropes, and rewarding their success.  It will grow by reaching out person by person to bring new members into the community.  They will stay if they can find a way to start with nothing, connect with others, and grow their audience and their accounts.

The next stage of Steemit rests in the hands of educators, sales and marketing, and our community outreach.  As a teacher, as an educator, as a communicator, as an activist, and as a passionate advocate for Steemit I know we can spread our message and our platform.  I know if we do that then we can build a better world.

For those that can envision a better world filled with Peace, Abundance, and Liberty I ask that you **upvote and resteem this post and you vote for me as witness!**

Sincerely and gratefully,

Aggroed
