OK... well, I missed selling on the last high.  I regret that because I quit my job.  I should have cashed out some when that happened, but I wasn't thinking that way yet.  Even still I don't really feel that bad selling steem at $5 or SBD at $7.  I think they'll be worth more by the end of the month.  I think this is just a temporary set back, but all this is getting me to think through money and my investments.

I have a fair amount invested in crypto right now.  The bulk of that is in Steem, but I used some of my author rewards to spread out my investment into other cryptos.  Ultimately I don't think that matters too much.  All of these altcoins basically go lockstep with btc.  I'm hoping/betting that one coin will rise faster than the others, but if I average out my hits and misses I'm betting I'm really mostly tracking my value with the value of btc at any given moment.  It's the rare few that have the bulk of their money sitting on tron before it moons 8M percent.

## New Plan <h2>

Right now I'm cashing out a small amount of post rewards every day.  I'm going to keep doing that to make sure my family has money to operate on.  Next up I've started a powerdown.  My goal here is to invest more in the media side of what I've been working on for a while.  I recently toured @davidpakman's studio and am working on a plan to get a lite version of that going.  Can think of my studio as a Dogepakman studio.  Much fun.  Very wow.  Such camera!

Anyway, I'm pulling some of that out of the system because I need some fiat to make that baby happen.  I'm also hoping to keep more steem as a liquid steem.  I want to be able to sell the highs and buy the dips.  Some folks make think that HODL is right, and generally I agree, but now that I quit muh jerb I can monitor the market a little better and try to use some best guesses of highs and lows to sell low and buy high... but that takes liquid steem.  So, that's on the radar too.

## Spreading some back to fiat <h2>

I happen to think this is a small correction of where the market is heading.  I think we'll hit 100k btc by 2020.  I think as more people come online it'll be worth more and more, and as the value goes higher more and more people will want in.  Some exchanges are seeing 100k new users a day right now and struggling over the growth.  It seems to me there's more room for growth even if 20k btc seems absurd to us now.  That leads me to think that Steem is gonna have a banner year.  I think we'll be at $50 or more by the end of the year.  So, I do hate the idea of selling at less than that, but timing matters.

What I'm really looking to be able to do is ladder sell near the highs and ladder buys near the lows and hopefully catch some good discounts on steem while paying my bills.  I also think I need to diversify.  I'm pretty excited for the returns in crypto, but the risk seems through the rough all the time, and the stress is high too.  Kudos to the guys doing this for a while and having the balls to hodl through some gruesome down turns.  But they're probably single.  I've got a wife and kids and no stable employment (though I did pickup a nice gig writing a white paper for another coin).  So, I'm trying to balance that stuff out.

As much as I hate it I think I'm gonna have to invest some of this in some more stable shit.  I guess I'll start paying down my house faster...  

## Cool opportunity <h2>

This wasn't worth it's own post and I'm hoping they don't read this, but I made an appointment with a crypto VC firm in Boston.  I'm gonna pitch them on the gospel of Steem.  This fits in with my mission of growing the steem ecosystem.  Hopefully they'll be passive investors rather than circle jerk some other VC firms that come in or even better use us as a platform to talk about their investments and what they're doing.

Who knows.  Could be cool.

## Not financial advice <h2>

I hate that we're putting this on these kinda posts.  But this is what's right for me and my family.  do what's right for you and yours.   I'm not a financial advisor or at least I don't self identify taht way.  I identify as a vegan diamond encrusted knapsack and clearly those can't provide financial advice.  W/e these disclaimers are dumb.
