Ben Fulford is a journalist and a blogger that writes stories on world events.  He was a former Forbes Magazine contributor before he moved to Japan and started covering stories from there.  His father was a Canadian politician.  Ben has a weekly series that he posts on his website that gives a high level perspective of world events.  Some of the things he's written have come true with remarkable accuracy.  The Asian Investment Bank becoming a $50B thing is one of them.  Some of the things he's written have been flat wrong like when he predicted the wrong Pope would emerge victorious.

## Discernment <h2>
I'm not advocating Ben a sole source of truth.  I am advocating Ben as a wonderful place to find stories an headlines that you won't find elsewhere.  He has since described his acceptance into what he calls the "White Dragon Society."  It would appear to be a number of secret societies and possibly criminal gangs that have decided to come together "to help fix the planet."  He now puts out talking points and stories naming sources from within the vatican, CIA, Japanese underground, and other less frequently publicly mentioned groups.  He shares a novel perspective, but I wouldn't read it thinking everything will turn out to be true.

## What does he cover <h2>

He'll talk about Khazarians... a lot.  They are a group of people that worshipped Baphomet (the goat headed God) and were a lying and duplicitous group.  They did a fair amount of conquering themselves but eventually ran against a stronger nation and were basically forced to give up their Baphomet worship and join some of the other cultures.  Instead of that they only gave up Baphomet in public and some picked Christianity, Islam, and Judaism as their public religion, but privately they continued worshipping Baphomet.  This tribe continues to operate this way with people placed in all of the major religions.

He'll talk about ongoing news event, but provide a perspective of who is working with who and why.  He'll mention skirmishes that are happening both with soldiers and with economics.  He'll describe the back drop of world politics.  He'll sometimes go into the religious beliefs of the people he's describing to help clarify how they got to their current view point.

## Why I like him the most <h2>
His pieces usually end the same way.  Something to the effect of: if we work together we can kick out the criminal elements, grow the economy in a meritocracy, share world power, and end environmental destruction along with poverty.  There are others in the world that I'm not a huge fan of that share great stories and perspectives of what's wrong, but then suggest really dumb conclusions going forward.  I'm not sure everything he says is true, I do think he believes what he writes, and I like what he's working towards.

Also too, the world makes more sense to me with some of his world view mixed in.  People aren't bad in general, but there are leaders all throughout the world that are and have become severely compromised as a result.  The world being run by a handful of sadistic people with bad intentions and tons of wealth and power makes more sense than the world being run by kind but inept people.

## Writing Sample <h2>

Negotiations for world peace proceeding smoothly as more bad guys bite the dust
Posted by benjaminMay 15, 2017
A North Korean peace deal, a Ukrainain peace deal and a resolution of Middle Eastern problems, including the Israeli/Palestinian issue are all being negotiated behind the scenes, multiple sources agree. This is why US President Donald Trump will be going to Israel, Saudi Arabia and then Rome starting on the 24th of this month, the sources say. Trump himself told Fox TV that after these meetings he would go to “the big conference of our countries that are going to help the world.”
(Comment can be heard at the 25 minute 10 second mark)

The details of the peace deal with North Korea are yet to be negotiated but sources close to the talks say North Korea will be offered a guarantee of sovereignty and security in exchange for publicly giving up its nuclear weapons program. Of course this will only be a face saving gesture since, in secret, North Korea will be allowed to keep its nuclear deterrent, the sources say.
The pending North Korean peace accord is definitely related to China’s massive one belt one road (obor) infrastructure initiative since a peace accord in the Korean peninsula would allow for the construction of a tunnel linking Japan to the Eurasian mainland. Construction on this tunnel has already begun, Japanese government sources admit
The presence of delegates from the United States, South Korea, Japan, Germany, the UK and France at China’s big obor gathering this weekend shows Western resistance to this project has ended. The fact Chinese President Xi Jinping stopped in Alaska on the way back from his recent summit meeting with Trump, means it is a pretty good guess a deal has been reached to make a tunnel linking Alaska to the Eurasian landmass.
Already, freight trains are going from London and Germany to China, cutting the travel time for goods by half and lowering costs as well.

These new land freight routes are one of the reasons the Baltic Dry Index remains stuck at a very low level since overland travel is both cheaper and faster within Eurasia. It will not be too far in the future before it will be possible to take a train or ship goods by train from New York to London via China and Russia. An underground high 3000 kilometer per hour vacuum tube rail tunnel linking London and New York is also expected to go into operation, sources in the US secret space program say.
The Chinese are also hoping to once again become inventors of world changing technology like the compass, gunpowder, paper and printing. Chinese President Xi Jinping says the Chinese are investing vast sums to create breakthroughs in the areas of AI, nanotechnology, quantum computing and “smart cities.”
This massive Chinese initiative may well be dwarfed by a Western initiative being secretly negotiated that will...
