Minnow Mayor Town Hall:  We're starting one hour early based on Daylight Savings.  So, the show starts at the top of the hour.  Anyone interested in coming on air is welcome.

The show is open to anyone who would like to come on air.  You can promote a post, read a story, talk about a project, or whatever you'd like to do.

To listen go to mspwaves.com/listen.

If you'd like to participate by chat and conversation then join us through discord at minnowpond.org.
