I got a busy day lined up for you.  We're starting off with Steem Visions.  It's a Saturday morning panel discussion hosted by @stellabelle and @juliakponsford.  We've lined up some great artists to present their work and talk about it.  I'm excited to share this with you!  I'll play some music starting in about an hour to give people time to come into the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Discord Channel](minnowpond.org).  The show starts at 11am EST (90 min from when this posts, and 1600 UTC).

Here's the [major details to Steem Visions!](https://steemit.com/art/@aggroed/steem-visions-an-artist-discussion-and-online-exhibit-hosted-with-stellabelle-and-juliakponsford-boston-meetup-saturday)

## Boston Meetup <h2>

After this morning's presentation I'm going into Boston to host a meetup.  It's not too late to join us.  It's all happening on Beacon St in Brookline.  We're going to start by getting some Sushi at 2pm and we'll wrap up by playing some board games at Knight Moves.

You can find the details for the [Boston meetup here](https://mspsteem.com/meetup/@aggroed/boston-meetup-this-saturday).

## Peace Academy <h2>

Ok, wrapping up a busy Saturday is the Peace Academy.  At 9pm EST (0200 UTC) I'll have just gotten home from Brookline and I'll dive right in with my cohost @isaria and we'll talk about how to live in state of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  This week will likely include a discussion of dealing with grief and how to break free from a victim mentality.

We'll be doing this online at [msp-waves](https://mspwaves.com/listen) and in [Discord](minnowpond.org).  I hope to see you there!

## Witness work <h2>

Witnesses are two things.  They are a server and a person running the server.  The server's job is to responsibly and ethically create the blockchain.  Servers have to stay up to date and not attempt to put fake transactions to enrich individuals into the block.  As for people they typically fall into the category of developer or community builder.  Most of the witnesses in the top 20 are developers.  A handful are community builders.  There's 1-2 unicorns in there that can do both.

All of these kinds of projects listed above represent contributions I'm making to add value to the Steem blockchain.  The goals remain the same since I started my Witness campaign: Spread the Values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, Help Steem grow, and Train and Retain Minnows on the Platform.  If you like what I'm doing and what I stand for I would ask that you consider voting for my [witness](steemit.com/~witnesses).

## The law of intensifying bullshit <h2>

This is a rough week.  Normally in my life when bad things happen it tends to pour in.  I'm gonna try keep my shit together, but this week saw my uncle die.  He was the last remaining member of my mother's side of that generation.  Down to me, my brother and two cousins...  I'm now down to my Dad and his sister as the remaining members of the generation above mine.  It's a lonely feeling.  Anyway, please send my family some love, prayers, white light, or whatever.  It's a rough time, and if today doesn't go perfectly that seems likely to be part of the day's plan.  Please bear with me.
