It's fun to host the show.  Thanks for coming by.  We had 12 guests.  @kubbyelizabeth won the 25SBD from Dice Bitches.  She's chosen to donate it to mspwaves.com.  @crimsonclad won the 250 SP delegation, but is currently ineligible so, I'm waiting to hear who she wants to receive it.

Here's the show chopped into shorter sections.  Here are the guests I had on.
