Hey @Ned,

The first thing I did today as soon as I woke up was check fuzzy's posts to see if your flags were still there.  I was disappointed to see that they were.  So far no harm has been caused by them having been placed, but if the posts clear you will cause $1,600 of harm to 1,600 votes and their respective voters and post author.  There's still time to do this a different way.

Please remove your flags.

## These flags appear as a form of violence <h2>

Striking someone or taking money from them without citing the cause is a form of violence.  Striking 1,600 individual votes and their respective voters and removing post rewards is again a form of violence, but done to many people.  Sometimes these things are justified or justifiable, but you have no explanation on the block so it's unclear what your motives are and unclear what your intentions are.  

Please remove your flags.

## Please use your words first, and your flags last.  

It would seem you have many routes still available to you especially as Fuzzy seems more than willing to talk it out.  Can you please remove your flags and instead just reach out and talk to the guy?

## Your message is muddled <h2>

I've had multiple discussions with multiple people directly involved and those that aren't.  The one thing that is clear is that it's unclear what you're protesting.  Leaving 3 very large flags without any explanation doesn't actually let this audience know why you're upset, why you think you've been harmed, or what your intentions are.  If you're trying to send a message with these flags the message isn't coming through.

Please remove your flags, and just reach out to Fuzzy.

## Values <h2>

There's a reason the Minnow Support Project isn't in it's own Discord Channel.  It's sitting in the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty network.  The project is in that channel to support those values, which I think are pretty universal in this community.  There are now 4500+ Steemians that are in the PALnet channel, and it's the largest off-chain Steemian Community by several thousand people.  I'm feeling pretty confidant that Steemians want Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.

## Your 3 flags don't hold true to those values <h2>

Using flags to express displeasure when you haven't used your words first isn't a testament to the value of Peace.
Using flags that take away post rewards from 1,600 votes and their respective voters isn't a testament to Abundance.
Using flags to silence or attempt to silence Fuzzy isn't a testament to Liberty.

Please remove your flags.

## I don't consent to your actions Ned, please change them  <h2>

Ned,  please remove the flags.  Please reach out to Fuzzy instead.  You still have several days to do this without any real harm having been caused.  Please send a message, and try to work it out without flagging.  This seems entirely possible and doable in this case.  Please make that effort!

## We have a world to change <h2>

Ned, as I noted. I really respect the shit out of what you're trying to accomplish.  I'm incredibly grateful for your efforts to build this platform and accelerate it's growth.  This blockchain, this community, and our collective voice have the ability to change the world.  That will happen infinitely better if we're aligned as a community and working collaboratively.  We have some big things we have to do as a community if we're going to take on wordpress, gmail, reddit, facebook, and a list of other competitors.  To do that we're going to need people that can think up and code great projects.  The entire ecosystem and the goals of the platform truly needs the part of the ecosystem that you're flagging.  

So, please unflag the three posts with 1600+ votes, reach out in any number of ways, and mend before any actual harm happens.  We won't look at that as a capitulation, but as a success in leadership.  

I'm counting on your to find another way and lead by example here.  All the minnows are looking up to you.  Please don't let us down.
