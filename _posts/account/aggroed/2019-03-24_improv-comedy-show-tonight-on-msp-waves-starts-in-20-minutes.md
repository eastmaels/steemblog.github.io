So, my last show has had some weird things happening to it, so my saturday night show is getting a little bit of a make over.  We'll do some improv comedy and music tonight.  It's not really socially acceptable, but that's half the fun and the source of much of the comedy.

If you'd like to participate on air as a comedian doing improv just hop into the channel.  If you're just looking for a good thing to do on a boring saturday night come into PALnet through minnowpond.org or listen via mspwaves.com.

Should be fun!
