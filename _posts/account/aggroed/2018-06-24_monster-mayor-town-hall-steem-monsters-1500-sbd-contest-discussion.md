So... we have a 1500 SBD writing contest.  It starts officially tomorrow.  There were pre announcements 2 weeks ago.  Last week was all about forming teams.  Monday the teams officially have 1 week to complete the template.  This is a fair amount of work.  I worked with the gold/purple (aka gurple) team to put their template together.  You can see it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WCARZM6e_f2bVdgswriZHDmr9BbsA2rVetQG1xypToM)

I'm going to talk about the contest and explain what it is and how it works.  I'm going to use the Gold Splinter as one of the main cases of what I'm looking for.

## Agenda

Describe the Steem Monsters Campaign Setting 1500 SBD contest 
Discuss how to participate
