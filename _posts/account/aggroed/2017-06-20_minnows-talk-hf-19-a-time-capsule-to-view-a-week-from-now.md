I put out the first ever PALnet bounty in our Discord Channel.  25SBD to the best author about HF19 and some descritption of the Minnow Support Project (MSP).  HF 19 changes took place 2 hours prior to the start time of the bounty.  I've collected their posts and present them to you here for a quick view into the minds of minnows in these first hours.

Some of these guys are super stoked on day 1.  I look at the trending page and see basically the same thing I did yesterday.  The same people, but now it's more money to them.  I have a post that went to $900 in 20 minutes.  If that's sustainable, maybe this is ok, but I'm waiting to see how the whole thing shakes out about a week or two from now for final judgement.  I'm still super concerned that we're going to funnel even more money to even fewer authors.  Maybe making a minnow vote 15 cents instead of 3 is worth that.  We'll see.

If you're running a witness you can't get by on 8 GB of ram anymore.  You've probably crashed if you did that.  So, get your shit together and listen to @someguy123 when he posts about that ahead of the release.

Steem went up and is coming back down.  I think we're under $2 at the time of this writing.  Exciting shit.
