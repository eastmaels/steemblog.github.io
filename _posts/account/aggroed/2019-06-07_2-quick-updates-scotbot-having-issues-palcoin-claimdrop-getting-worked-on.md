Sorry for the quick note.  I'm driving to PA, and have been a little unavailable for parts of the issues tonight.

## Scotbot

Scotbot isn't responding right now.  I can't reach the dev.  I dont' have a good backup plan other than wait for him to wake up.  Obviously this isn't the best plan and we'll work on alternatives after the bot is fixed and replayed.  There's likely some weird outlier case that stopped the DB from properly storing posts.  When it is replayed all the voting you did will be logged and votes applied.  Blockchains are cool like that.

Nothing was lost.  Sorry if your post didn't trend for a little bit there, but it's very likely to fixed in the next 12 hours or so.  If it isn't fixed by then I'll send out another update with what's going on and the plan to fix it.

## Claimdrop

I know everyone wants their PALcoin.  We want to give them to you.  There was a small issue with the test case and we're trying to make sure we get it right.  So, that needs a couple tweaks but since the dev lives "Down Under" he's actually on it now.  Hopefully that's in the next 12 hours too.

## It'll get fixed, Steem-engine.com is unaffected, your posts will be rewarded and miners will get claims

Should be fun.  Sorry for the delayed response.  We appreciate your patience.  We're still new, and I'll make a better system for the "oh shit" moments.
