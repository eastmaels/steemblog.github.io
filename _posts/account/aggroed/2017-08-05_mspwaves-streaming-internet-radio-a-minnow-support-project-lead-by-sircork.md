Over the last week I've tossed up a few hasitly written posts to mention the fact that I was about to go on air.  In most of the cases I was on the air, and I really only had 1-2 minutes between songs to try to write up anything that I could send out.  At this moment I'm not on air, and I've made a conscious decision to keep Discord closed to I can talk about MSPwaves.

## We built a fricken' radio station <h2>

I can't tell you how happy I am.  A few weeks ago I mentioned to a few people that we should build a radio station.  Yesterday I finished off my third shift.  While we're just getting started and not trying to hype too much, I thought I should start letting more of the cat out of the bag since it's working and she's steady.

## In truth this is @sircork 's baby  <h2>

I mentioned the idea and said I'd be supporting it and within days he had a word press site up, got a media server up and running, solved technical issues of figuring out how to schedule shows, how to connect the media server to multiple outlets, how to connect multiple people to 1 media server, how to train djs, how to run shows, how to document it, and last on my list (but I'm sure there are many others) how to keep track of all the songs we play, which is a license requirement.

Seriously, dude figured that shit out in 1-2 weeks.  The universe provided him with @ma1neevent to help him run the station, and now he's also got MSP moderator @r0nd0n in there working on the show too.  Then in addition to the top list he also got access to a whole library of royalty free music for us to play without any branding on it for very little money.

## What I've done? <h2>

While trying to help him the best I can and provide a space and a framework through the PALnet discord channel, publicly post and resteem to help, create a new account as a good home for posts, and use the bot that @netuoso created to give more people access to the @msp-waves account I've also foot the bill for the streaming license!

There are still a few more checks and monthly bill to go out.  Looks like I'm taking the big ones, and @sircork has opted to pay the smaller ones, which come each month.  I suspect each of us will be out 500-750 a year for this project, but I'm also assuming that the community may chip in or upvote radio posts enough to help us recoup expenses.  Even if the latter doesn't happen... I'll be ok.  Cause ffs I got a radio station, and a couple radio shows!

## What's it take to get a show? <h2>

First off, if you didn't know already the Minnow Support Project is a public organization run by elected witnesses for the betterment of the entire community.  There's 4,500+ people in that Discord channel.  We're open 24/7 and there is usually a few moderators and a few witnesses in there around the clock.  Any community member in good standing is welcome (we'll even tolerate some that aren't in hopes to get them back in good standing).  The same deal goes for the radio show.  We may run into time conflicts or something, but EVERYONE is welcome.  You want a show?  Talk to @sircork or @ma1neevent.  They'll get you straight!

## What's it take to be on the air <h2>

You need a comp, a headset, a mic, a good internet connection, and a program called OBS aka Open Broadcast System.  I found the setup of OBS to be a pain in the ass, but Cork showed me a few things it was easy enough to mimic the things we did to add new options.  While setting up OBS is a pain running it is *1 click*.  FFS, you push a button and you're streaming on air at that point.  So good... (so good, so good)

## What's it feel like to be a DJ <h2>

First word is frantic.  I'm in spotify pickin' songs. I'm in Discord chatting.  I'm checking out lists of hits on websites, I'm in direct messages from all the people that visit me while I'm spinning tracks.  I'm probably writing a Steemit post to let people know what's up and recoup some expenses.  I'm taking requests like this one from @timcliff where I specified it had to be a 90s rock song to fit with the show.

After Hectic it feels light.  I'm groovin' in my chair, I'm grabbin' snacks, I'm playing tracks, I'm improvising stories to share over the air, and I'm making up sponsor ads, which don't actually exist.  (that said you should totally use @lovejuice, and check out steemshelves.com to serialize your posts).

It's really fun to get to see the audience react.  I put on Rage Against the Machine and a bunch of listeners confirm head banging.  I mean I was doing it, I know they were doing it, but now it's better in a virtual mosh pit.

It's meaningful.  People give tracks that they loved and often they come with a dedication to the ones they love.  There's something about hearing your music and intent over the public airwaves to a specific person that adds some volume to it.

## So, there you have it <h2>
We are still in training and building mode for sure.  But we haz radio, and so do you!

You can listen live at the mspwaves website- http://mspwaves.com/home/listen/

Join us as a DJ, hangout during shows, or contact folks on the list if you want to go air with them.

PS if you ever see my name in Discord as SkankJ you know I'm on air.  Hope to see you in there!
