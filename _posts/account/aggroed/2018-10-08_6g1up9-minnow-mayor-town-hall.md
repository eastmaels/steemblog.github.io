Hey all, I hope you're having an excellent night.  Tonight is Sunday night.  So that means it's time for the Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  Come on air and talk to me about whatever you'd like.  Bend the ear of a top 20 witness for what you'd like to see happen on the chain, talk about the changes of HF20, talk about a post or project you'd like to promote.  Do whatever!  We're good.

If you don't have anything to say I'll fill the air with Steem Monsters... cause fighting starts in a week.  Should be fun.  We've already started paying out winners in the trial settings.  You're not going to want to miss out on $100 bucks a day up for grabs or $1000 a week when tournaments start!

Some, hop on into minnowpond.org and come hang out with in PALnet on MSP-Waves as the Minnow Mayor Town Hall show goes live with Special Guest: YOU!

Show starts in 5 min!
