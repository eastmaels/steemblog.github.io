I'm pleased to announce two additional media personalities will be joining us for the Panel Discussion this Saturday.

## Adam Kokesh <h2>
![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbCjvKLFu4X9d84tnJHGP1fHDEexVHRqfgtE35cFypXou/image.png)
@adamkokesh is a military veteran and advocate for civil liberties.  He's been on syndicated radio, had his own tv show on RT, been arrested multiple times defending freedom and an all around activist for the people.  He's been on Steemit since 2016 and is a frequent contributor to d.tube.  

I'm very excited to bring him onto the Panel this Saturday and looking forward to hearing about his experience here versus the rest of media where he has 53k twitter followers, 225k subs on Youtube, 75k followers on FB, and a healthy showing of 5,000 followers on Steem!

## Huwsnursery <h2>

@huwsnursery is a brand new Steemian who hasn't even made his first post yet.  He's a gardening YouTube protoge.  In a short time he's amassed 70k subs.  It would appear he's looking to broaden his reach into the Steem platform and see what we have to offer.  He's in the sweet spot of 100k-1M subscriber accounts that have the potential to earn more on Steem than on other platforms.  I'm interested to hear his thoughts and what's keeping him from his first post, and what his plans are for Steem.  Should be fun!
