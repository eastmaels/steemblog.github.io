That's right folks!  You can catch me and @justtryme90 at Knight Moves in Brookline Massachusetts one week from today.  It'll be awesome!!!  You can find this event and others at http://minnowsupportproject.org/events/.

Knight Moves is a board game cafe.  Careful, there are two in the greater Boston area.  This is the one located in Brookline.  The address is 1402 Beacon St.  I'll be there around 6pm, but the event will start for real at 6:30 and run through 8pm.  @donkeypong is putting the screws in to turn this into a routine meetup.  Pretty sure I'm game.  We have something like 10 people that are confirmed to be there.  If we can get to 15-20 I'll host these at least once a month.

We'll have a flash fiction and a flash science contest.  I'm offering a few resteems (to more than 4,000 people) and I'll offer some prizes for random things that have come from liquid rewards of these posts.

I'm gonna try to broadcast some of it out through the web.  I'll at least be live blogging the event in the Minnow Support Project Discord Server called PALnet- https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw.  More details on that a week from, but that's a good reminder for me to tell you to check out mspwaves.com.  The Minnow Support Project already has 10 radio shows ready to go live.  We'll be at around 20 when we formally launch next week.  Should be awesome.
