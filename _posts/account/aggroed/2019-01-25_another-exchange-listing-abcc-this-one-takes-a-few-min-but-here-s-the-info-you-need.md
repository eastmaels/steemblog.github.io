Hey my fellow Steemians, there's another exchange that is taking suggestions for new projects to list.  It only seems fitting that after our success with Netcoins that we should try to get listed on another exchange.  Fair warning, this one is a bit more complicated and will take a little more effort, but I also think it will be worth it.  You can find out about [abcc](https://abcc.com/) here and then below is how you can help us get listed.

You can click [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRYmN9jQmK5ErgLgusI6CUUx1k9LxNwpi1lGJp93gO3HCdXg/viewform) to get to the Google Doc to recommend STEEM.
You will need some information to do this along with a Google account and a Telegram account.  To help, I've collected the following information to help speed up the process for those of you that want to participate.  I'm sure if we work together we can keep growing!

1. Email address.  The document knows what Google account you are signed into.

2. Your full name.

3. Your full contact number with country and area code.

4. Your Telegram ID.

It will then ask if you have submitted an application before.

You will then be asked about your position with this coin.  Almost all of us should be selecting Community Member.

Token name: STEEM

Ticker symbol: STEEM

You will be asked for a short description of the project, for example:
A turnkey blockchain for building decentralized applications and communities.

A link to the latest version of the white paper:
https://steem.com/steem-bluepaper.pdf

A link to a block explorer:
https://steemd.com/

Our project is a blockchain.

Our project has been listed on other exchanges.

A link to our coinmarketcap page:
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steem/

Official website:
https://steem.com/

Project Profile:
https://steem.com/about/

Team Background:
Ned Scott, Executive Chairman
https://steemit.com/@ned

Elizabeth Powell, Managing Director
https://steemit.com/@elipowell

We then get into some questions that we have no information about:
Investors
Advisors
Strategic Partnerships
Public and Private sales data

You're not able to leave it blank, so just put N/A

Next we will be asked how many users/coin holders we have:
We know that there are over 1,000,000 accounts.  I put 1000000.

We will then be asked for the projects social media links:

8,000 Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/steemit/
24,500 Steemit: https://steemit.com/@steemitblog
26,000 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/steemnetwork/
107,000 Twitter: https://twitter.com/steemit
