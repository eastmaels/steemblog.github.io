I didn't have any tears when I lost the Pumpkin vote.  But I had some when I got to be back in the top 20.  I'm a big softy.  That said, this is my home and I spend the vast majority of every day 7 days a week doing things to support and grow this community and ecosystem.  So, it hurt when someone that significant dropped my witness, but it's a million times better to see people all over the world come out and support me!  I'm so thankful!

## I love the work I do and this let's me do it.  

I quit my job to work on Steem full time.  Being a top 20 witness right now doesn't provide a ton of income, but it provides enough safety net that I don't have work a 40 hour a week fiat job I hate.  Thanks for a boost back into the top 20 so I can continue to grow the Minnow  Support Project, MSP-Waves, Steem Monsters and now Steem Engine too.

## It came from all over!

USA, Europe, and Korea for the win!

Thanks to people all over this planet that came to help me get back to being a consensus witness.  In some ways this made my witness stronger than ever.  I'm the only top 20 that doesn't have a vote from @blocktrades or @pumpkin.  Makes me feel like "the people's champion."  Many people have stated that the top 20 is completely controlled by the two biggest actively voting stakeholders on the chain.  I'm proof for now that it isn't entirely true.   It's kinda amazing to have achieved this level of support.  All it took was working 7 days a week on this blockchain for close to 2 years!  That's all you gotta do :)

## Back on the mission!

Spread the Values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty
Train and retain new members on the platform
Bring to life new tools to grow the Steem ecosytem

With love,

@aggroed
Witness 18
