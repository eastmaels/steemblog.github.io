<p>The value in steem is entirely based on the the people that use it. &nbsp;People are the value to currency. &nbsp;In order to get more people here we need to lower the price of steem so more people can buy in (and we can kick the ponzi/oligarchy element to the economy) and we have to raise the price of steem so that people are rewarded for their posts.</p>
<p>On the surface that sounds impossible to do at the same time. &nbsp;That said. &nbsp;I think both can happen. &nbsp;The 10:1 reverse split that @ned and @dan had in mind for two years out they should do now with their changes mentioned in the @steemitblog post.</p>
<p>Here's what I'm envisioning- 1. &nbsp;Whales power down and cash out of the system faster because of the drop to 3 months to cash out. &nbsp;That means a lot of liquid steem hits the market and normal people can buy in cheaper than before. &nbsp;It makes it so a lot more people have steem which is a good thing for the economy overall. &nbsp;At the same time we do a 10:1 reverse swap meaning that the price of an individual steem goes up. &nbsp;That means when the rewards are calculated people are seeing a much larger value for their posts attracting more people to the site to blog here and earn a currency here.</p>
<p>Basically, the other piece of the puzzle I'm advocating for that isn't currently on their radar is a reserve split now rather than 2 years out, and later we shouldn't actually need one since the majority of the inflation is going away. &nbsp;This will allow the whales to cash out without crashing the price even worse, get more people interested in blogging here, which will in turn expand the economy and make it worth more overall.</p>

<p>Lastly, I sold all my Steem dollars for steem today after the announcement. &nbsp;So if you have it in your heart to promote this post for $5.01 that will ensure that the terrorists don't win, that luck and fortune will befall you and all the people that read this, and make sure a fairy doesn't die from cancer.</p>
