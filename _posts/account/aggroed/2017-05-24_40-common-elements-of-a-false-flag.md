Governments around the world have planned and carried out false flag attacks on their own people for years.  They serve as as way to tighten control on the population, support a new war, make people live in fear, and in the case where people actually die they are able to eliminate political threats.

Posts like this- http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/02/41-admitted-false-flag-attacks.html will literally take you through history and reveal 40+ historic events where the details were later released and the event was formally admitted as a false flag.

While scrolling through my feed I found one of the best writeups of how to know if something is a false flag.  Here are 40 indicators that let you know it's a false flag-  This list was generated by https://www.facebook.com/kurt.haskell who is a retired attorney living in Costa Rica who basically spends his entire life disproving media and government narratives.

False Flag Indicators:
1. The perpetrators have had recent arrests and have gotten very lenient sentences for what they were charged with.
2. The government has been warned of the attack and done nothing to stop it.
3. Eyewitness accounts differ on key details from the official version.
4. The perpetrators don't go to trial (dead or escape).
5. A victim from the crime that should have been killed miraculously lives to give out details of the event.
6. Key video is hidden. Still pictures, which are often grainy or unclear are repleased to support the official story.
7. The perpetrators are tied to ISIS or Syria.
8. The perpetrators are identified in record time.
9. Dropped identification of the perpetrators is found.
10. DNA from the perpetrators is found in too many places and is run through lab tests in record time to make an identification.
11. The attack was on or in public transportation.
12. The amount of dead shrinks as the event plays out.
13. New laws or military action take place as a result of the event.
14. The event receives an abnormal amount of press coverage.
15. The country where the event took place has recently irritated Israel in some way.
16. The event and perpetrators are set up to cause conflict between several different religious, ethnic or sexual orientation groups.
17. The term "assault rifle" is widely used to describe the perpetrators weapon by eyewitnesses.
18. The friends and family of the victims do interviews that are not believable.
19. Suicide vests are used and at least one doesn't detonate.
20. One or more bombs do not detonate.
21. A gun jams, thereby saving someone from death.
22. An unbelievable hero story is released by the press on day two, usually accompanied by a gofundme account.
23. A manifesto is released by the perpetrators.
24. A drill is taking place at or near the event at the same time.
25. The US Government gives an incredible amount of money to the victims families.
26. The victims in hospitals miraculously heal and disappear in record time. The hospitals provide no update or 'one' large press conference is given to discuss the progress of their imaginary patients.
27. Little to no amateur cell phone video footage of the event is released.
28. The perpetrators have recently disappeared for at least two months.
29. An online video is found of the perpetrator acting crazy.
30. The details of the event make it impossible to not be reminded of other recent false flag events.
31. Friends and family members suddenly change careers to become professional anti-gun lobbyists.
32. The perpetrators wore body armor or it is found at the scene.
33. Former military members play key roles in the event in some way.
34. There is little to no proof that anybody died or was injured.
35. Federal agencies are on the scene in record time and numbers that would not normally be possible In a short time period without prior knowledge.
36. Federal agencies take over the scene even though it is an event not normally under their jurisdiction.
37. Rita Katz and S.I.T.E. immediately "find" evidence that ties the perpetrators to radical Islam.
38. No tears are shed by family members in the immediate aftermath of the event.
39. Footage from other events is passed off as actual video from this event.
40. Unverifiable social media posts pop up immediately after the event to point the finger at the perpetrators.

## Bonus thought by yours truly <h2>
While that list is awesome it's missing one key element.  These events are always happening whenever a news cycle is destroying the powers that be.  Seth Rich's murder is without a doubt a terrifying story line for the folks in charge.  Podesta has an email where he says "I just made a example" of someone timed right around the DNC leaks and Seth's murder.  So, mark my words.  You're going to see a horrible tragedy like this every time the news cycle needs a reason to hop off something bad for the cabal.
