This is an article written by Anna Von Reitz.  She's living in Alaska and calls herself a state judge.  She differentiates between the state of alaska and alaska state. The state of alaska is a corporation.  It's a government services contract organization that's masquerading as the alaska state which is a constitutional republic.  She argues in other writings that basically every official in America is following a similar scheme.  There is a very real and healthy constiutional republic that has been abandoned since the civil war.  That's because when the south seceeded there was no longer a quorum and so the north created a corporate entity that claimed to represent the true republic and left all the republic seats and positions vacant.

As soon as the Obama is out of the office it's going to get very clear he's not actually an American.  The birther movement was probably correct there, but the missed the real story.  The reason he can sit as president and it's legal is that he's not actually the president of the united states which we think of as a constitutional republic.  He's president ie ceo of a government services corporation that is masquerading as a government.  There is no law against a ceo being from another country so he's not actually breaking the corporate mission statement and operating documents of the company (the Constitution of the United States of America).  he's breaking a million other laws, but it's ok to be a ceo of an american company from another country, but I digress.

Here's an alternative take on what the IRS is written by Anna Von Reitz.  I find her story and thoughts on what this government is extremely compelling.

The True History of the Income Tax and IRS ---- Again
The first income tax was called "Peter's Pence" and it was collected along with a Confession of Sins on April 15 every year in both England an France beginning in the early 1100's as an extra mandatory "offering" to pay for the cost of the Crusades.
Sound familiar? A tax on income..... a confession (filing)....due on April 15....to support the cost of a war?
Fast forward to the "American Civil War" --- a tax on income fails the constitutional test, but is imposed on all "territorial citizens", that is, federal civilian and military employees and those born in the "territories and possessions" of the United States.
American state nationals are protected under the provisions of the Constitution(s) but federal citizens are not. Federal citizens can be taxed to the moon and back, and imposed upon and even killed by the whim of Congress acting as a plenary oligarchy operating a foreign municipal city state government.
Look at Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 and read Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion in Downes v. Bidwell and the rest of the Insular Tariff cases. You will see what has gone on here, how and why. You won't like it a bit, but you will catch on.
The first modern "Internal Revenue Service"---then as now-- was operated entirely in international jurisdiction by privateers running first out of Barbados and later removed to Puerto Rico. The personnel responsible for collecting the tax are Merchant Marine Warrant Officers called "Withholding Agents". The personnel responsible for oversight of all these Merchant Mariners and federal corporation operators are Internal Revenue Agents.
Abraham Lincoln fundraised for the war effort by selling "1040 Bonds"---- so called because these bonds mature in either 10 or 40 years. The revenue realized by the sale is used to pay off war debt.
Today, the funds from the yearly collection of "1040 Forms" results in the issuance of more bonds based on the labor and assets of the people, but with the federal government and its "federated state" franchises being the beneficiaries.
Up to World War II, most Americans were not subject to the "federal income tax" at all---- only federal civilian employees, military personnel, African Americans, people born in Puerto Rico, Guam, etc., federal welfare recipients and federal dependents (wards of state such as political asylum seekers), and actual corporations that held their charters under United States auspices were required to file as a condition of their employment or else their receipt of "benefits" from the Public Charitable Trust set up for the relief of poor black plantation slaves who were displaced by the Civil War or the "privilege" of a public charter to do "indemnified" business.
Then, as we entered WWII, Congress passed The Victory Tax---- allowing non-citizens, that is, people who were not federal employees, not political asylum seekers, not African American, etc., to "voluntarily" pay the federal income tax as a patriotic gesture in support of the war effort.
Millions of patriotic American state nationals signed up and gave an average of two bucks extra a month to the government via direct contribution at their workplace, collected by their employers.
There was no specific end date attached to The Victory Tax, because there was no specific known date for the end of the war, so the tax was supposed to end with the "end of hostilities"------meaning in real life, it should have no longer been collected from American state nationals as of August, 1945.
Instead, the Federales kept right on collecting----and enforcing the collection--- of federal income taxes from people who were never federal citizens and who never knowingly or voluntarily received any charter to operate as federal corporations, and who should have been released from any obligation upon the Japanese surrender.
This is why generations of Internal Revenue Commissioners and other IRS higher-up employees have stood in front of the TV cameras and described this as a "voluntary tax".
You were misinformed about the nature of the tax and you were misinformed and told that it applied to you, when in fact it never did.
The word "income" itself by definition is a corporate accrual. Your wages, salaries, tips, and other earnings are private property.
So what's going on here?
A gigantic, vicious, self-interested fraud.
The fact is that by far the vast majority of Americans are naturally exempt from the federal income tax, and if you are, you can "revoke your election to pay".
If you are an average American state national who is self-employed or employed in the private sector, you never really owed the federal income tax in the first place--- that is, if you were born on the land of one of the sovereign states and are not voluntarily choosing to operate as a federal corporation named after YOUR NAME, not a federal employee (United States Citizen), not a federal dependent (citizen of the United States), not African American, not born in Puerto Rico, etc. --- you are paying a tax you don't owe, one that never applied to you, and one that can't be forced upon you if you correctly object.
As you can see, there are people and there are organizations (actual corporations) that do owe the federal income tax, but there are also millions upon millions of people and organizations who do not and who never did owe any federal income tax who are being coerced and extorted out of large portions of the value of their labor under false pretenses and criminally self-interested legal presumptions.
The last time I looked, the "revocation" clause was located at Section 6013 of the Internal Revenue Code, Title 26. It gets moved around a bit, thanks to shuffling of pages and sections, but it remains as it has to remain as remedy for the crime being perpetuated against the people of this country.
You are free to send Notice to the Commissioner(s) of Revenue declaring your decision to "revoke my election to pay federal income taxes" at any time, and once you do this, you can NEVER pay federal income taxes again---by law.
This will, I know, be a great disappointment to many.....
However, there are a couple of caveats yet to be observed.
Your letter of revocation must be proven to be received, so you have to keep your mailing receipt and a copy of your letter and a return receipt, if at all possible, to prove that you sent your correspondence and that it was received by the (now three) IRS, Internal Revenue Service, and INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE Commissioners.
You have to remember that the federal fiscal year ends June 30 and begins July 1 of each year and that "tax years" lag behind normal calendar years. Thus, if you wish to stop paying taxes effective with the federal tax year of 2012, you would make your revocation of election effective July 1, 2011----the prior year.
And you should be at some pains to explain that you "made a mistake" and that you were never actually a volunteer Warrant Officer in the Merchant Marine Service and were confused about what a "Withholding Agent" was when you signed your prior 1040 forms.
Now that you know, you won't be confused again....
The submission of a 1040, 1065, or any other "federal" tax form creates the presumption that you are either a "United States Citizen" (employee) or "citizen of the United States" (slave) or operator of a federal corporation (YOUR NAME) or an actual business corporation with a federal charter. This presumption can be rebutted with a "revocation of election to pay" or simply never filing any federal tax forms to begin with and standing your ground as a private American state national---so long as you are not naturally a member of one of those groups who are actually required to pay federal income taxes.
If you have already made the mistake of filing paperwork as a "Withholding Agent", the act of doing so creates a "novation contract" which is a repetition of performance contract-----another legal presumption that you are in fact a volunteer Warrant Officer in the Merchant Marines and that you will be filing tax forms again the next year.
This is what gives rise to "Failure to File" charges.
However, now that you have admitted your mistake and that you know what a Withholding Agent is ---and know that you are not a Withholding Agent---it would be illegal inducement to perjure yourself to require you to file anything saying that you were voluntarily acting in that capacity, wouldn't it?
Yes, indeed. It would.
One of the most curious facts is that if you file a 1040 or other form and you make any mistakes at all---- on purpose or not --- you can be held accountable for a felony and up to five years in prison and all sorts of fines. But if you never file anything at all, the most you can be charged with is a misdemeanor and up to a year in jail.
This is because when you claim under penalty of perjury to be a federal officer ---- a Withholding Agent--- and fail to perform your duty, it is a serious crime under martial law. But when you claim no such official capacity and are merely presumed to be a "federal citizen" in the first place, the court has nothing but a legal presumption backing its actions against you and no actual evidence provided by your wet-ink signature on a 1040 or other filing.
So bust their presumptions. If you aren't naturally subject to federal territorial or municipal jurisdiction, nor overjoyed with the "service" you are receiving from the "federal government" corporation and its federated "states of states"----- claim your exemption. Revoke your election to pay federal income taxes. Stop paying the Beast that is offering to eat you.
It is your right and at some point, your responsibility, to see to it that your money is funding the actual government that is owed to you and not a fly-by-night foreign subcontractor making false claims against you and fleecing you blind. ~Anna Von Reitz
