On the Minnow Mayor Town Hall I invited David Pantone and Remy Marco to speak about a "GEET" engine. The claims of the GEET engine are:

1.  It creates a high temperature front and a low temperature front
2.  Those fronts meet at a metal or glass rod
3.  The rod ionizes essentially from static electricity
4.  The fuel mixture running over the ionized rod will create a plasma and the fuel undergoes electrolysis.  In the case of water it creates hydrogen gas.
5.  The standard internal combustion engine burns some combination of gasoline vapors, hydrogen gas, and oxygen.

## I was convinced enough to try some more experiments <h2>

From what I saw and heard I am convinced enough to buy a generator, put it on my property, and try to measure efficiency, fuel use, output, and other metrics.

The main thing I heard that convinced me was how when there was an electric draw on the RV I could hear the generator react.  Both R0n and I were convinced the RV was pulling a load on the generator.

The main thing I saw that convinced me was after he took the rod out of the GEET engine the rod displayed some truly bizarre magnetic behavior.  I can't underscore this enough.  It was bizarre!  He took the rod out and the rod was ionized.  You can tell because a compass would realign to face N or S depending on which pole of the rod he was measuring.  That's weird because there's nothing about combustion that would make me think it would ionize a rod.  More importantly though is that the magnetic properties of the rod were weird.  The part of the rod furtherst from the Earth was the North pole.  If he flipped the rod upside down the pole of the rod shifted.  That's weird!

## Magnetic pole shifts like that aren't normal <h2>

Consider a big red horseshoe magnet for a second.   The orientation to the earth doesn't change which pole is which.  I can move it however and those atoms are locked in place.  The field around the magnet changes as I rotate it, but the North Pole and South Pole don't just switch sides.  The pole on this rod changed due to orientation to the earth.

I'm not sure what causes that.  I don't think I've ever seen that behavior before.  It was much less prevalent on the glass rod than on the metal rod, but if you squint it might be present.  Tough to know from one short test.  As a chemist I can't think of what would cause this.  My best guess is that there are particles on the surface of the rod that get ionized and are mobile.  Presumably the negative ones are slightly heavier and when the rod is rotated they move towards the bottom of the rod and the electrostatic interactions push the positive ones up.  I don't know that for sure, but that would be my leading hypothesis because I don't know of other rigid metal magnets that are able to switch poles by changing orientation to the Earth.

I don't think things that gets ionized from static electricity will usually have a rotating pole like this.  I have more research to do.

So, the plan:

R0n is an electrician and we'll work to hook up an external generator to my house.  Remy will modify that generator using a couple hundred bucks worth of parts from a machine shop and Home Depot to convert it to a GEET engine.  We'll either run a separate load of some heaters and ASIC miners to test it or we'll run the house on the generator.  I'll try to measure the amount of fuel consumed and see if I can get a baseline of information.  Then we'll get Remy to GEET 'er done and measure the delta in performance and consumption.  

The most likely worst case scenario is I have a new generator that I just took out of warranty (which maybe means I should try to find an old generator off of Craig's list) by modifying it.  Best case scenario I help spread a technology that converts water into electricity using fairly inexpensive equipment and cheap fuel.

We'll see?!?!?!?!?
