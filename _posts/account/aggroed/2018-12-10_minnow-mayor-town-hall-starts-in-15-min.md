So, I've been a little more focused on being Dadgroed and a little less focused on being Aggroed.  I had to push back the witness forum until this Saturday.   I had to skip my last couple of shows.  Young babygroed decided to take mommy and I on a handful of unexpected trips to the hospital for false labor and then decided to take several days.

Ok, so, the minnow mayor town hall starts in 15.  It's a show on the MSP-Waves broadcast station.  You can find us in minnowpond.org.  That's a discord channel where we house the Minnow Support Project and gather many steemians in what we call the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network.

The Town Hall is designed to allow anyone on the platform access to a top 20 witness, founder of msp-waves, founder of MSP, founder of Steem Monsters.  I'm just here to be of service to the community in any way I can.  If no one has shit to say we'll just spin some tracks from choon if I'm recording or from spotify if I'm not.

If you do have things you want to say or bring up, which during these trying times could make some sense, then come swing by, make sure your mic is hooked up, and come ride the Waves with us!!!
