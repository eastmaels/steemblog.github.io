I have my first ever unboxing (technically it's an unbagging) video I've ever produced below.  It shows receipts of the promised goods from paywithsteem.com.  I highly recommend them.  It was easy and they seem like good people.

This was my final installment in my paywithsteem series.  I have now tested their amazon wishlist, purchased a giftcard from them, and now had an arrival of earbuds from their standard marketplace.  What's not to like about a company that will accept steem and return to you trade goods.  I think we should be supporting them!


Looks like they are focused on amazon wishlists now.  And less on goods.
