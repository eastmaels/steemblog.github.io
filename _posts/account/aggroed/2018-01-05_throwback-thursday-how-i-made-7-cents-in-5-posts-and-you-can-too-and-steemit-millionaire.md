I was reminded just the other day when Steem breached $8 USD that at one point I had written about being a Steemit Millionaire.  [It](https://steemit.com/drugs/@aggroed/how-i-became-the-first-steemitmillionaire) was one of the very first posts I ever made.  It was actually a challenge to find it because you can't scroll back in condenser far enough.  So, I dug in through steemd.com/@aggroed and found this baby.

Now remember I didn't start on this platform as the useful person you know me as now.  It took a while for a love of this place to kick in, but again for some important and life altering reason $8 Steem reminded me of that post.  There's no way I'd imagine the story ark I've been on for the last 3 years, but it's been pretty amazing.  I'm not sure I can tell everyone it's bound to happen to them.  That's probably not the case, but I do think that Steem can pay off in spades if you stick with it.

[Bo Burnham tells it better than me](http://theinterrobang.com/bo-burnham-tells-young-people-quit/)

I dreamed about that million.  I was envious when @trafalgar wrote [about it](https://steemit.com/steemit/@trafalgar/3-months-1000-followers-and-usd1-million-later).  Pretty amazing watching this place blow up!

## 7 cents in 5 posts <h2>

I see some minnows who are new to the platform that are upset that their content is only earning a handful of sbds when they post.  It's hard to keep perspective on that.  It's like listening to my now deceased grandfather about living through WWII and the shortages of everything.  I mean, this is only 1 year ago, but again, internet time is like dog years on steroids.  So, here's a throw back post about [how I made 7 cents in 5 posts](https://steemit.com/steem/@aggroed/how-i-made-usd0-07-cents-in-5-posts-and-how-you-can-too).  If you think it's hard now you can't imagine how hard it was to get started under free for all exponential rewards and a terrible distribution.


## Now I feel like an old man <h2>

Cue the Angry and Deranged Old Man Voice:

"Back in my day we didn't have linear rewards you ungrateful shit.  We had to earn Steem by fondling whale balls every second of the day because we couldn't upvote worth shit.  You know how long it took me to get to a 2 cent vote?  6 MONTHS!  Fucking 6 MONTHS!  Here's the [post](https://steemit.com/steem/@aggroed/you-know-you-made-it-on-steemit-when) I made celebrating that fucking milestone.  You god damned kids!  GET OFF MUH STEEM!!!"

## @stellabelle <h2>

One lady I like quite a lot on the platform is Stella.  She's old school as far as Steem goes.  I like her vision of a tribal gift economy.  It sounds so much better than the shit fiat world we live in now.  Some people aren't giant fans of hers, but I've always liked her.  I mean that literally.  Check out my steemd.com/@aggroed.  The very literal first thing I ever did on Steem was follow her!

## Anyway, I'm just reminiscing about the past <h2>

Follow your dreams, have fun, earn Steem.  Spend a life in crypto.  I think there's life and happiness to be had there.  Also as a teaser to my next post I'd like to thank the central bankers of the world for being such terrible shitty economy riggers... I'll explain later.
