Welcome class.  Please be quiet and take your seats.  (pause) There now.  Much better.  Thank you all for coming.  I know it was court ordered attendance for some of you, but we can overlook that.  You're in room 112C.  My name is Dr. Aggroed.  And you're here to study modern Steeming Etiquette.  Everyone here supposed to be in this room?  Yes?  Then let's begin today's class session on Shit posting properly.

Many people like to post pure shit on this platform.  That is of course your right to do so, but there are some generally accepted rules to govern such behavior.... Excuse me sir, yes you, can you please take off your hat.  We're trying to be civilized.  Thank you.

## Let's start by defining what exactly a shit post is.  <h2>

A shit post will have at least one of the following  characteristics.
1.  You supply a link, an image, or a web hosted video with virtually no text, context, or support and you yourself did not create the page, image, or video that you shared.
2.  The post took you literally under 1 minute to put together from start to finish.
3.  The post incites hate on purpose and as it's central point.
4.  It's a post that already showed up on your wall that you're simply jiggin' a little and then reposting as your own.

What's that?  A selfie... are you naked in it?  Then sorry.  If it's just a plain selfie then it's a shit post.  Yes? You in the back.  Sorry dear, it's still a shit post even if you're hot.  Yes, sorry, especially if you have duck lips.

## But you really want to shit post <h2>

Oh don't worry!  I'm not saying that you can't shit post.  This platform is quite welcoming.  I'm simply stating there is a simple rule that makes your shit posting ok and non-harmful to the community rewards and unlikely to hurt your future earnings by pissing off your followers and "autobots."

All you have to do is the following.  In the bottom right hand side of your article click the drop down menu and switch it to "Decline Payout."

Once you have accomlished this brief task you should feel free to shit post as much as you'd like.   Yes Miss?  Do I have a recent example?  Yes I do.

https://steemit.com/btcc/@aggroed/currently-in-second-place-on-the-btcc-thing-you-should-probably-vote-for-steem-if-you-want-it-to-go-up-in-price

These are all regarding the BTCC twitter poll.  I'll admit to having seen it on my wall.  So, I decided to resteem the post and then as time went on to make new posts and share those.  It isn't exactly breaking news that the polls have shifted slightly over time or that the poll is closing soon because that post has been going around.  So, I myself considered all three of these to be shit posts and as a consequence I opted with pride to "decline payout."

## Are there any ways out of these Rules? <h2>
The main one is that Minnows will be forgiven for such transgressions.  Their behavior doesn't greatly impact the platform and they are still learning how to navigate this place.

The other main rule is a "work" around.  Get it... the point is that it takes work to turn a shit post into a post that's valuable.  You create an article surrounding the thing you just posted.

## Are there consequences for shit posting without the decline payment option selected? <h2>
No?  Yes?  If you do it once in a while you might not be punished by the community.  If you do it many times it's possible your followers will abandon you.  If you're a whale and you do it then it's possible that a boogie man will hunt you down.  You will ultimately hurt your reputation and long term rewards by shit posting without declining your payments.

Now if you'll excuse me I have some very important things to attend to.
