Its good for the block when Steem wins this kinda stuff.  It's a small thing, but I'd really like to show up God's Unchained!  Won't you help?  Please vote for Steem Monsters.

Take a screenshot, put in in the comments and I'll raffle some gold foil cards to anyone that votes and shows it.  

EDIT 3/2/19- Please note.  Anyone that votes for anyone will be eligible.  I'm not requiring the people that will get in the raffle for cards vote for Steem Monsters.  I just hope you will.
