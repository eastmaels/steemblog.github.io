Ok, giving something a shot here.  I have a ton of Steem Monsters cards.  More than I can use personally, and I've kept them for 2 reasons.  The first reason is that I believe that even a small change in the daily number of players can have a drastic effect on the price of cards.  We only have around 2k players that play every day.  There's so much room for growth it's absurd and when it happens i think the cards will have a beautiful moonshot.

The second reason I have this many cards is for the ability to rent them out!  I want to make it cheaper and easier to access this game, and I'm willing to use my cards as a way to do that.  Instead of holding a lot of expensive cards and taking a financial risk there or spending money you don't have now you can simply rent them.  I want to facilitate this!

## Delegation Room in Discord

So, while we wait for markets to develop I've put a #delegation room into the Steem monsters Discord.  You can have all the conversation you want there regarding card delegation.  in the not too distant future I expect markets to form for this and it'll be a few clicks to get your cards rented out.

## Delegating from a new account

I've moved my extra cards in my collection over to a new account I created called @smalp.  I've listed my cards that I have for rent here 
 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WNsU0KFTxc7Qgxvo1fl1DaEv3cDEBWF2Wj_Io3h1H-c/edit#gid=1660397888

That has pricing that I'll try to update every day.  It's based on either a 24-36 month payback time period.

It doesn't have all my extra cards on there as it's a lot of clicking, but I'll move all my excess there and make it all available for rent

## SMALP Token

I created a SMALP token.  I'll accept these tokens at a value of 0.5 steem = 1 SMALP.  I plan to do a few things with them.

1.  Give them out in tournaments for free or low registration costs so that players can get access to higher level cards by winning tournaments.

2.  Trading SMALP for cards you don't want.  I'm essentially acting like a pawn shop here with a custom token.  Trade your unwanted cards off with SMALP, get some renting tokens back, and pick up the cards you do want for a month at a time.

3.  I've listed 5k SMALP for sale at a discount on Steem Engine.  And put another 5k up there as well just for sale.  This token doens't promise any returns or profits and isnt' designed to be a security.  It's just a tracking mechanism for me to be able to rent out my cards in a way I can ensure that if give out some tokens they can really only be used for this enterprise.

4.  If the account is successful I'm likely buying more cards, but I may also do a bidbot and accept these tokens back for votes too.

## $12.5k

The account is backed by $12.k worth of cards right now and I'll add more over time.  If you're wondering what protects the purchase of SMALP coins that's it.


## That's it for now happy leasing!!!
