<p>"Jasmine COME OUT!" Sissy Rick shouted. &nbsp;"I told you yesterday I'd be back. &nbsp;Well here I am!"</p>
<p>Jas looked through the slots in her windows. &nbsp;Sissy Rick was in that pink sweat stain'd shirt. &nbsp;Where'd he find those sunglasses since the lights went dark anyway? &nbsp;Musta had them 'fore it went dark. &nbsp;It was clear enough to see him. &nbsp;Sunlight hit him square midday.</p>
<p>"Come on sweet heart. &nbsp;This land is needed by the Enclave. &nbsp;You can join honey. &nbsp;Just com' out!" &nbsp;Fat Jimmy looked like he always did. &nbsp;Fat. &nbsp;He was huger 'fore it went dark, but he was still huge. &nbsp;His 'clown pants' looked big all the time, but now they didn't fit by a size or two. &nbsp;He was wearing that red checkered shirt. &nbsp;He looked like a 4th of July picnic table got fat and grew fat limbs. &nbsp;I ain't Fat Jimmy's sweet heart. &nbsp;That's for sure.</p>
<p>"Jas, I've known you since the firs' grade. &nbsp;You didn't shoot then. &nbsp;You don't shoot now. &nbsp;Even if you did shoot I know you ain't got no bullets. &nbsp;You know how much they cost?" Rick spit on the ground. &nbsp;"Look honey. &nbsp;You got land. &nbsp;We need land. &nbsp;We need you too." &nbsp;That last part almost sounded sincere. &nbsp;Trouble is I done know 'bout you doin' this to a few other farmers 'round here.</p>
<p>Also, yes, yes I know what bullets cost. &nbsp;It cost me all my chickens. &nbsp;You hear a chicken cluckin' on my farm? &nbsp;You hear me cookin' omelettes today? &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;Were you in town the year I won that shootin' benefit for the 4-H? &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;I got a surprise for you. &nbsp;She looked down the barrel of the rifle. &nbsp;This ain't but 30 yards.</p>
<p>Rickity Andrew spoke next. &nbsp;"Look, why don't you just come on out and we can talk about this." &nbsp;He was old and had a cane. &nbsp;He was Daddy Cade. &nbsp;He started walking forward.</p>
<p>"You take one more step I'm gonna draw blood now. &nbsp;You hear me? &nbsp;I don't want this!" &nbsp;Jasmine shouted.</p>
<p>"Oooooh weeeeeeii. &nbsp;She got fire for you Pop." &nbsp;He slapped his leg and let out a yip. &nbsp;"Go ahead then. &nbsp;We're gonna walk in. &nbsp;I took it easy on you yesterday cause we were friend. &nbsp;Not TODAY!" &nbsp;He was trying to be intimidating, but ain't nobody gonna take Sissy Rick serious when it comes to manning up.</p>
<p>"We're gonna take Bessy. &nbsp;We're gonna take them chickens. &nbsp;Then we're gonna go! &nbsp;No one is gonna hurt you, but Jas women and children are starvin' in the Enclave. &nbsp;You'r' tough you'll be ok!" &nbsp;Sissy Rick took a look at the chicken coop. &nbsp;He was thinking about breakfast tomorrow. &nbsp;He wasn't stupid, but it took him a minute to figure out with the sun behind the coop that it was quiet and he didn't see anything. &nbsp;While he was thinking Fat Jimmy took a step forward.</p>
<p>BOOM.</p>
<p>The sound of the shot rippled across the farm. &nbsp;Bessy kicked. &nbsp;Sissy Rick started backing up. &nbsp;Fat Jimmy started screaming and holding his leg. &nbsp;Looks like he got his period unexpectedly. &nbsp;I reckon I got a few days before I know if they coming back or they just gonna let this one slide.</p>
<p>Sissy Rick looked white in the face. &nbsp;I didn' even shoot him. &nbsp;"You boys owe me some chickens fer'that!"</p>
