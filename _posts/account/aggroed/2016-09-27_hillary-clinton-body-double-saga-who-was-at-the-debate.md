<p>I've spent 16 days staring at face shots of Hillary Clinton as I've tried to figure out who is running around after her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk4smWRMe9M">collapse on 9/11/16.</a> (Before going on too far see how well you can spot the difference in this 2 minute <a href="https://goo.gl/2hmmNL">survey</a>).</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk4smWRMe9M</p>
<p>Some people think she was arrested here because her hands are behind her back at the start of the video. &nbsp;To me it looks like her hands are resting on the pillar to support her and at least her right hand moves in front of her as she starts going towards the car. &nbsp;This suggests she's not in cuffs and that kills a major suspicion of why people thought it may have been an arrest. &nbsp;Some have also suggested this video is suspect. &nbsp;As we'll see soon the campaign is using doctored footage, and there are concerns this too may be tampered with. &nbsp;It appears in the background that people are moving too fast, there is random bird poop that falls from the stopped car's right headlight, and the grates seem to move in and out of the steel support pillar. &nbsp;More important than the inconsistencies in the footage though is that somebody is right behind Hillary filming as they shove her in the car. &nbsp;He's behind the security lines, so he's allowed to do it and it's odd.</p>
<p>I've tried to figure out what are the <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@aggroed/medical-conjecture-secretary-clinton-likely-suffers-from-late-stage-syphilis">serious medical conditions</a> that afflict her (short answer is likely tertiary syphilis or cancer). &nbsp;Her publicly disclosed symptoms include dehydration, flu, pneumonia, allergies, concussion and coughing. &nbsp;Unofficial symptoms include leaked records of blood clots and dementia. &nbsp;The campaign suggested she may have poisoned. &nbsp;Candid video shows evidence of a tongue lesion/cist that was removed and seizures. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr1IDQ2V1eM">Other doctors</a> have stated they believe she has Parkinson's Disease or Parkisonism. &nbsp;Off the record testimony by previous secret service members suggest that she's more extra-maritally sexually active than Bill Clinton. &nbsp;The day of her collapse they appear to be doing a neurological test to squeeze a hand, which is not necessary for pneumonia and dehydration. &nbsp;Taken together it's possible that she has multiple illnesses, but a single umbrella illness that could account for all of the symptoms is late stage syphilis with an additional possibility of cancer.</p>

<p>While many suggest that Clinton suffers from strabismus or something akin to a lazy eye we'll see that appears to happen for two reasons. &nbsp;1. &nbsp;When she's having a seizure her eyes don't track. &nbsp;2. &nbsp;When her second body double is speaking she appears to have the eye issues, but we'll get to this in a little bit.</p>
<h1>Hillary's First Body Double, Double-1</h1>
<p>The first woman that emerged from Chelsea's apartment, which was a former state licensed home medical care facility <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@aggroed/secretary-clinton-teresa-barnwell-a-professional-clinton-impersonator-and-a-potential-unidentified-body-double-at-the-9-11">didn't look anything like her</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://s16.postimg.org/g6mswpds5/home_health_care.jpg" width="715" height="447"/><br>
She was too thin, her hand prints didn't match, she looked 20 years younger, her nose was off, she wasn't wearing the same jewelry as earlier that day, and wrinkles on her face didn't match. &nbsp;I wasn't the only one that noticed. &nbsp;Twitter exploded with the search term Hillarysbodydouble.</p>

<p>People also were curious about the staged photo opp with the kid in that they said she had pnuemonia and now she's hugging children... and people noted her distinct lack of security detail when she emerged.</p>

<h1>Hillary's Second Body Double, Double-2</h1>
<p>A second body double emerged several days later in Greensboro who is also younger, often out of focus, has her videos clearly edited and again lacks the same lines on her face. &nbsp;While most images of her are of very low resolution and highly pixelated there are a set of higher quality photos and a post campaign stop interview that are of higher quality. &nbsp;In the post campaign stop interview in particular she has some facial similarities, but is missing some characteristics of the Secretary's face. She also has a moment where she has no recollection and really no personal connection to a personal detail of her life she had had with the reporter, and her demeanor is odd in that she's constantly head bobbing and seems to act out of character for the Secretary.</p>
<p>I call this first shot the Predator shot (as in Arnold's movie).</p>

<p>Note the completely wrong color eyes. &nbsp;She's 20 years younger. &nbsp;Her neck isn't wrinkled.</p>

<p>Here's the interview she gives right after she delivers a press conference in Orlando Florida. &nbsp;Notice the constant head bobbing, goofy grins, and total lack of remembering personal details of a former interaction with the reporter. &nbsp;In lots of spy movies you may remember them asking about personal interactions as a way to verify people are who they say they are (think terminator Genesis), and her total flub is another data point/indicator that she's not the same person as who was there for the surgery they discuss.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUA4H_HZCKA</p>
<p>Additionally, her face just looks off. &nbsp;Some of the wrinkles don't line up, the personality is different, and her face is too long and angular.</p>
<p>Double-2 got busted for Strabimus or what I crassly refer to as her lazy eye.</p>
<p><img src="https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/hillarys-eyes.png?w=500&amp;h=233" width="500" height="233"/></p>
<p>Notice the terrible video quality below that seems to follow Double-2 at every campaign stop.</p>

<h1>Hillarysdeath</h1>
<p>It's been confusing at times trying to figure out who is out there making campaign stops and claiming to be Hillary Clinton. &nbsp;This has been made more difficult by the 4 claims of Hillary's death. &nbsp;I saw an image of a Chuck Todd Tweet saying she's dead, but I didn't screen shot it and can't find it again.</p>

<p>The Hillary Clinton from August of 2016 (I use this designation because once you know at least 2 doubles have been used it sheds doubt on who this person might be) also appeared on 3 TV shows. &nbsp;She was on Face the Nation, she was on Between Two Ferns, and she was on Jimmy Fallon. &nbsp;However, to the best of my knowledge those shows were pre-recorded before 9/11. &nbsp;Between two ferns was recorded on 9/9/16 and may be the most accurate portrait of a pre collapse Clinton.</p>

<p>In general here are the list of things that I look for when inspecting these photos and videos.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Does she have wrinkles on her forehead when her eyebrows raise?</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Does she have bags under her eyes?</p>
<p>3. Do her crows feet extend from her eyes when her face is at rest??</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Can I find one photo from an event that shows the 3 moles/wrens she has on the right side of her face? &nbsp;They are not always visible when her mouth is moving, but she has a prominent mole on her upper right lip, a less prominent mole/wren on the upper right very near the corner of her mouth, and a third on her lower right lip.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;It's difficult to see, but she has a wrinkle that extends from above her nostril up to her right eye, but only one side the left side of her face unless the right side is extremely scrunched up. &nbsp;It curves into her eye slightly beneath the bag under that eye.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Her neck is very wrinkly and as her head/neck turn she'll have wrinkles that will extend basically from ear to ear at the base of her neck. &nbsp;They also form an X across her throat when she's sitting, has loose skin, and has her head tilted forward slightly.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;Her nose has a small bridge, it elevates slightly through the length of her nose, it has a small dip near the end of her nose, and then a small lift at the end. &nbsp;It is not an extremely flat nose such that you could put a ruler on it and have it touch at all points.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;She has a "Joker's smile" such that as her cheeks go up in a triangular way. &nbsp;She'll have semi circle wrinkles on the right side of her face where the triangular portion ends, and then she'll have wrinkles that extend in a large semi circle from the corner of her smile up to the bottom left side of her crow's feet.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;On the left side of her face as she smiles she has something like a norse lightning bolt wrinkle that extends from her left nostril to her lip and down her chin. &nbsp;Extending horrizontally she has a wrinkle that cuts halfway through her cheek and then follows her cheek bone to the crows feet on that side.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Who won the debate?</h1>
<p><img src="https://scontent.fbos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s480x480/14449063_1159767540759536_7560493567286773845_n.jpg?oh=17b1f6f0227e682a487cb6ba3da59ccc&amp;oe=5874FFFB" width="480" height="342"/></p>
<h1>As for who was at the debate?</h1>
<p>I don't think it was Double-2. &nbsp;Double-2 doesn't have the right eye color. &nbsp;Her nose looks different. &nbsp;She looks 20 years younger, and I don't understand how she could go from old to young back to old in an 11 day span. &nbsp;Her neck isn't wrinkled to anywhere near the same degree. &nbsp;In half the footage of her I don't see any moles/wrens. &nbsp;When her eyebrows go up there are barely any wrinkles. &nbsp;I don't see freckles or age spots on her forehead. &nbsp;When she grins she gets some of the wrinkles on her face, but particularly on her left side she doesn't ever show a deep crease running through the middle of her cheek.</p>
<p><img src="https://s16.postimg.org/vr3gptet1/debate_vs_tarmac.jpg" width="762" height="471"/></p>
<p>This woman I also think of as Double-2. &nbsp;I don't think it's her at the debate. &nbsp;One of the main problems for me is that the left half of her smile doesn't ever show the crease going halfway through her cheek. &nbsp;Her face is more angular and elongated where as Clinton's is rounder. &nbsp;She has some of the wrinkles, but never all of them. &nbsp;She seems to walk and move better than Clinton, and her nostril always seems to big and too high. &nbsp;She's also a lot doofier or goofy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>When I look at comparison shots for Clinton pre 9/11 I think they fit. &nbsp;It's looks like one hell of a chemical peel, but I think it's her.</p>

<p>Well it seems she's back for now. &nbsp;It's very exciting. &nbsp;I'll keep looking at photos to see if she vanishes again. &nbsp;That said her name wasn't spelt correctly on the ticket, which is sometimes just a real mistake and at other times an admission.</p>

<p>The newer controversies are was Trump on cocaine during the debate and did she use a wire?</p>

<p>Howard Dean's asks via <a href="https://twitter.com/GovHowardDean/status/780588448470163456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Twitter</a> if Trump is a coke user. &nbsp;This is from the feed.</p>

<p>Other than that this election is pretty boring... &nbsp;Here's my commentary on the video.</p>
