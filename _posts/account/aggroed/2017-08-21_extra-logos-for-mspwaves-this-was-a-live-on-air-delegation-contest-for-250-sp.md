So, while on the air I decided to put together a 250 SP delegation contest.  The entry was simply to make any kind of art that was in regards to mspwaves.com.  You can find some really great stuff in here.  There is one stick figure penis, so if you're in a work environment it's not unsafe for work per say, but I wouldn't want your boss that doesn't think that shit's funny to walk in and see a giant hand drawn MSPaint penis on your screen.  Also, if you're the boss, and you happen to see this art, and you're offended... unless you work in a child friendly environment...  you gotta chill.  You gotta relax.  This stuff is funny.  Make sure you have a positive attitude and enjoy life... it's just a digital weiner.  Life moves on.

Anyway, here are your entries.  It's a contest folks.  So, vote below.  The winner will be decided by most votes.  you vote by writing their name in the comment section.  You can choose 2.  This contest will end in 2 days.  So, vote now!
