<p>This is a Walpini. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.treehugger.com/green-architecture/build-underground-greenhouse-garden-year-round.html">Image source</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.treehugger.com/assets/images/2013/02/walipini-2.jpg.662x0_q70_crop-scale.jpg"/>Walpinis are a real thing. &nbsp;They are underground greehouses. &nbsp;It's normally cheaper to build and run than a greenhouse. &nbsp;In the summer the earth keeps it cool. &nbsp;In the winter the earth keeps it warm.</p>
<p>When the hard times come I hope my underground Walpini is done. &nbsp;I also want to do aquaponics in it. &nbsp;Basically I want to get a deep swimming pool in my back yard. &nbsp;The deep end is for fish. &nbsp;The shallow end is for vegetables. &nbsp;The fact that it's underground and hopefully with a glass or plastic top means the water won't completely freeze over in winter. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a link to <a href="http://www.backyardaquaponics.com/">aquaponics</a>. &nbsp;Grow fish, they put nutrients in the water. &nbsp;Grow vegetables they take nutrients out of the water and give back clean water to the fish. &nbsp;Put in fish food, get back vegetables.</p>
