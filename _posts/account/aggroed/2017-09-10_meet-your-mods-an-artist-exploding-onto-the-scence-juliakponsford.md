OK, well, turns out I'm a Leet Witness!!!!  Not really in the technical sense of that, but in the sense that I passed 1337 Witness votes!  So, that's awesome.  I'm highly appreciative of the support you're giving me.  I'm turning that back to support the minnows in the pond grow their accounts.

I asked them each the same set of questions as the other mods.

## Meet your Mods! <h2>
## @juliakponsford Not long after I joined Steemit I saw one of the minnosupport posts resteemed in my feed. I read the post but it wasn't a direct invitation type post so I was a bit confused about the concept. It took me seeing a few more posts to motivate me to look into it more!

When did you hear about the MSP?
## @juliakponsford Not long after I joined Steemit I saw one of the minnosupport posts resteemed in my feed. I read the post but it wasn't a direct invitation type post so I was a bit confused about the concept. It took me seeing a few more posts to motivate me to look into it more!
## @juliakponsford I joined because it seemed like a great place to network! Since there is no dm system yet on Steemit it can be hard to plan projects in private without cluttering up comment sections. Also I was hoping to be able to engage with more of the art community and thought it might be a good place to find them.
What do you think is the best aspect of the MSP?
## @juliakponsford The friendships has definitely been the main thing that has kept me here. I have never really enjoyed chat rooms in the past so to be honest I was a bit skeptical but the vibe around here is fantastic and there are so many great projects growing such as Make a MInnow and MSPwaves!
You're a moderator what does that mean to you?
## @juliakponsford Being a moderator to me means that I can be that friendly face that greets people who come in the door and being someone that others can look to if they need help! Even before becoming a mod i was trying to fill that role and pass on the kindness that was given to me but I suppose now it's official
What's your service project?
## @juliakponsford My service project is to mainly focus on the art community. I run a weekly contest called ART EXPLOSION that helps give the artists of Steemit more exposure. I also am starting a weekly art curation post to give exposure to new artists and I will also leave an invitation to encourage them to join MSP/PAL.
how much time do you spend on MSP stuff?
## @juliakponsford Oh dear, how many hours are there in a day? I'm overly addicted to chat and pop in as many times as I can, I also am now getting a lot of questions on Steemit on how to join. Let's say too many hours :)
Why does it matter to you so much?
## @juliakponsford It's important to me because since joining I have seen my fellow members and my own growth explode. It's a tough world on Steemit and as a community who encourages each other we can be much stronger!
We need some channel mods, why should people do it?
## @juliakponsford I think it's important that people take responsibility for encouraging growth in thier own niches. We are one strong team but much work can be done in a more focused way and it's great to meet your peers, whether that team is skill based or location based.
What excites you about Steemit?
## @juliakponsford Everything about Steemit excites me! The potential for people to earn money from their skills is a game changer, also it gives us the ability to meet people from all over the world. The many innovative ways in which the blockchain is being used is mind boggling for a relatively low tech person like myself!
What's a long term vision for where Steemit is going?and how do you fit into that?
## @juliakponsford It's tough to predict where Steemit will go as it continues to surprise me on a day to day basis. As far as my role, I have no delusions of grandeur but I hope that many more artists and musicians join to show off their talents and I will do my best to encourage and support them so they can thrive :)
What can MSP be doing better?  
## @juliakponsford I'll have to get back to you on this one. Since I joined there have been so many improvements. MSP mods are doing such a fantastic job already and protocols have been updated so the process of joining is getting smoother.
How can minnows contribute to the system and grow their accounts?
## @juliakponsford Every time I get this question I give the same answer, make quality content, and quality comments. Engage with your followers and make real connections. This seems to be the best way to thrive.
What else would you want to share here?
## @juliakponsford If you join minnowsupport on discord come and chat! I see the same group of faces and we are around 5K now so clearly a lot of the members are hiding! Come show your faces minnows!
