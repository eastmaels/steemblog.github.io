Wow, the single best conversation I've had since 2012 when I woke up.  I'm incredibly grateful to White Walking Feather.  He didn't know it when he came on the show, but I consider myself a disciple of his since I watched the movie UNGRIP.

UNGRIP is about a systematic understanding of who we are, what is the state, and what is the relationship between those two entities.  It's about understanding parts of law that can be used to help us understand our place in the world.

The story of White Walking Feather ultimately revolves around the notion of declaring peace.  That's an internal statement, a life choice, and a methodology used to approach interactions with our surroundings, our friends, our family, and the State.

## The conversation

I present below the recorded conversation that @wwf and I had last night.  It's hard to sum up as it's pretty long, but it's an exploration of who we are, a glimpse into the I AM, and an attempt to figure out a pathway forward that's both peaceful and convenient.  It's about questioning the world around us, and trying to find an equilibrium where we can have what we need, live comfortably, and shake the system to the core through peaceful coexistance in our community.  This involves many layers from the physical, the spiritual, and the corporate fictions that exist.

I'm personally at the crossroads of this conflict of both dying to get out and afraid of the consequences for my wife and very young children.  You can hear that conflict as I try to question rob about how to find the overlap, if it's even possible, between the fictitious world and living peacefully in spiritual practice while experiencing some of the convenience of the corporate fiction.

For Americans you are "voluntarily" a serf in a feudal system masked by a constitutional republic masked by a democrazy.   What is the alternative?
