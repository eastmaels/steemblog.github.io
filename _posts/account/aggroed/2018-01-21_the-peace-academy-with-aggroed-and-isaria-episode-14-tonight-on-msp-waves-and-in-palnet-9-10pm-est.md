# The Peace Academy with @aggroed and @isaria: Episode 14 Tonight on MSP-Waves and in PALnet! (9-10PM EST)


Our curriculum has revolved around the Non-Agression Principle as of late, and for good reason.

There's a lot of material to cover regarding the subject and it directly relates to our goals of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.

Individual freedom, personal responsibility, healthy boundaries, assertion rather than aggression, property rights, regaining our empathetic outlook when it comes to war....

These are all aspects of NAP that can help us break out of unhealthy cycles and achieve the peace and abundance that we all deserve.

***We also want to hear from you!***

Be sure to join the audience chat during the show and let us know if you want to come on air with us!
As long as what you have to say is about Peace, Abundance, or Liberty it's fair game!
