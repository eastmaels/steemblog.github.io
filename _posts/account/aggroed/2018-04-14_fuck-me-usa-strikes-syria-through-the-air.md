Ok, well, this looks grim as a starting point.  We probably shouldn't be launching an attack in Syria.  

I can think of two narratives that fit here.  

1. Trump is targetting the Deep State proxy army that's in Syria attempting to topple Assad
2. Trump is starting WWIII

## The Syria Chemical Weapons attack was staged

It is known to be staged adn setup at least a month in advance and was reported on by the Russians.


[Check out this video that has Russian Military discussing the fake gas attack they expected to hit in the exact region.](https://www.facebook.com/SputnikNews/videos/10156149537906181/?hc_ref=ARQmGtYrLdqIk7RvBtigQ2zJUopjfb59759K9FEP7R7Q_bHAT4NyYqSYIkTrh4VivB8)

## Q posted just now

Q at least seems to support the 1st narrative that Trump is doing a limited strike and has a good intel reason for the launch.

## No massive response

If we really just started World War III I think @globocop is right that every American would have their evening broadcast interupted by "USA is now at war with Russia.  Be ready!"

The lack of dire warning seems to indicate that we haven't just started WWIII.

I agree that on the surface this attack looks grim.  Hopefully it's not.

## Last thought

This can all be a giant distraction.  The last time we launched missiles into Syria the US struck an airfield and essentially bombed a field.  This can be theater.  In my most hopeful dreams this is meant to take the national news spotlight as a cover for domestic operations like unleashing 25k sealed indictments on the Deep State.

I don't know.  Gotta let it play out, but we all need to be posting, memeing, and stating clearly NO MORE WAR!
