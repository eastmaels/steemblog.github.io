This is the daily AgX chart for today 2018-02-07.<br/>Today's AgX factor is 0.96 for a STEEM/SBD ratio of 1.2.<h3>What is AgX?</h3><br/><br/>The Mayer's multiple (200 days moving average of the BTC/USD price) is known to be a good indicator of the BTC price evolution.
AgX aims to be a similar indicator regarding the STEEM/SBD ratio, in order for users to find the right moment to exchange their SBD for STEEM at the best possible rate.

## Plan <h2>

I'll make these posts on @aggroed for the next week or so and then move them over to a new account.  It's possible it won't matter in the long run if SBD is ever completely pegged, but until then the prices move and hopefully this informs some good decision making.
