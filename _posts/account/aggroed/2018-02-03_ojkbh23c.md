I'm thankful to have been joined by @choogirl, @followbtcnews, @scaredycatguide as we work through the basics of how a new person to crypto would buy/sell fiat for crypto or crypto for fiat.  Then we walk through some wallets, exchanges, and do the very lowest level of crypto investing terms and tools.

This show specifically avoids talking about hot picks for a given week or what folks should buy.  We don't know your financial situation so we can't tell you what you should be doing or what risks you should be taking on.  That said, for many people a position in crypto currency could be a good investment and could fit within the scope of their current investments.

While some of the show had a US centric perspective there we do present some of the concerns of our international audience, specifically our Australian counterparts, and provide a few web links they can use to exchange fiat and pay their bills.
