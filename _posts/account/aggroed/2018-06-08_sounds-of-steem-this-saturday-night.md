Hey party people!  It's that time again!  SOUNDS OF STEEM coming right at you!!!  We got another great Steem Music lineup.  This show is like a digital concert in your ear hole filling it with sweet sweet goodness!  If you haven't checked out steem musicians you're missing some great music.  We have talent that can stop your heart and fill your soul.  These are lovely creative people sending lovewaves through the radio waves.  Just try listening to a few minutes and I think you'll get why I get so excited to hear them play.  

You can listen to the radio repeat pop shit.  Or you can listen to steem musicians play and sing their hearts out.  It's an amazing experience.

## Format

We think it's important to get to know the people and get to hear the music.  So, we (@isaria, @swelker101 aka shane aka kevin) like to ask the performers some questions about their songs and their writing.  It's fun to get to know them.  Ok, so they chit chat with us for a couple min.  Spill their soul a bit or give us a glimpse of their personality, and then delight us with gifted performances.  It's good stuff!

## Logistics

Ok, so hopefully I got your attention.  Come check us out at the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord channel home of the Minnow Support Project](minnowpond.org).  

I'll spin some tunes starting at 10:30 am EST on this Saturday.  Then we'll get the show going right at 11am.  Musicians should show up a little early to make sure they can sound check and they sound good.  Then we'll go for two hours with live songs and interviews.  Should be fun.

You can also listen at www.msp-waves.com/listen.
