So, first off.  I have a radio show starting at 8pm EST (about 20-30 min from now) that will run for 2 hours.  it's called Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  It's a fun little show where we'll listen to some eclectic mix of mostly upbeat rock.   I'll be in the chatroom in Discord so you all can feel free to ask me whatever questions you have.  Lastly, I'll try to share some news, some Steemit happenings, and maybe even a post or two if you guys ask me nicely.

## Whaleometer <h2>

Thanks to over a year of posting, a week as a top Witness, and some personal investment.  I'm now half a whale.  I just crossed the 1/2 way mark.  Feels pretty freaking awesome!!!  I hate to sound like a broken record but the mission isn't changing.  We're gonna stay the course of supporting the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  While on the platform and on behalf of the platform I'm going to work to add new members, and help train and retain the ones we get to stick with Steemit.

## In case you missed it MSP has 5,000 accounts in our Discord room now! <h2>

I've said this for a while.  If you're not on Discord you're Steeming wrong.  And it's getting more so not less.  We're over 400 separate delegation to the Minnow Support Project.  We have an extremely active community building networks, programs, cool art, and a ton of creativity hittin' everywhere especially on MSPwaves radio which you can find at mspwaves.com.

## I just hit 1,000 Witness Votes!!! <h2>

Honestly, I don't think all of these things are unrelated.  It feels great to be rewarded by this platform for basically working non-stop on behalf of it.  Then it feels awesome to be able to use those rewards to help those on the platform and especially part of PAL and MSP to spread the wealth.  I've been a top witness for about a week.  There's already more than 1000 delegated SP because of it, and I'm still just warming up.  The whole point is to grow this place and help retain minnows.  Delegation to minnows until they are dolphins helps accomplish that.  So, I'm excited to keep supporting the little guys on the platform (especially active PALs) and making muh promises happen.  Thanks for so much support guys.  I promise to keep getting more done.  

I'm seeding the Steemit brain here... I think we need a new exchange... one controlled by Witnesses for the benefit of the platform.  HMU if you'd like to be a part or help provide some funding to get it launched.

## I gotta get prepped for muh Show! <h2>

I hope to see you there-  http://mspwaves.com/home/listen/
