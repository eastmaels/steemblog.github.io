The universe teaches through contrast.  So, I've made a highly bureaucratic government the antagonist and a free loving libertarian voluntaryst community the protagonist.  Let's see what happens to Admiral Santanta.

## Episode 4-  Time to rebuild <h2>

Captain Tanic Elotaw of the Dreadnaught class ship Peace Enforcer 782215 was happy-ish.  The quantum node was generated.  The slip occured, and he was back to the rough time, galaxy, and space he desired, but it literally took two years of his life to do.  It turns out that trying rebuild the quantum pulse reactor when it's heavily damaged, 2/3 of the engineering crew is dead, and you're in a jurassic age dimension is harder than it seems.

So, two years have passed for him, but it looks like he landed his ship within a day or so of his fight with Terrorist Santana.  Also, the coordinates weren't perfect.  It would appear it would take him two to three days to get back to the terrorist instigators, but two-three days is enough time for those little hive mind fuckers to get ships and defenses back up.  

Even worse than that is the signal jamming they do.  It's hard to get orders to everyone on the ship to exactly coordinate attacks when you can't relay a simple voice command.  He's even had his speakers start blaring cryrotoproic death metal or sometimes just get screaming vikings in his headset.  

So, Star System 004-221/4 is close by.  There's a military base there.  Time to restock and crush Santana.  It's also time to call his family.  Margaret will be thrilled that's he's been gone for two years and simultaneously hasn't.

## Previous- CH1 Episode 3 Plummeting with a Techtab and Solarnet"

For a lot of people dropping at above mach speeds plummeting towards the ground in a hunk of steel labelled "life support ship" you'd probably be freaked out of your mind, screaming, or passed out.  But to Santana this was just another day at the office.  When you fight for freedom your ship's gonna get blown up a few times.  Oh well, the last couple life boats worked out ok.

She knows the drill by now.  When she saw 3 torps coming in post slider heading for baby-3 she knew what was up.  Hit the big red "abandon ship" button, punch in the code, grab her techtab, retrieve the video logs, and hop in the life boat.  A lot of her crew and friends were dead.  That happens too...  There's gonna be a long bath and a few bottles of wine for today, and by wine she means straight gin.  Mistakes demand their due.

Anyway, back to the task at hand.  She pulls out the techtab and logs into solarnet.  Luckily reception is good because she can see the satellite about 1 click from her head.  

"Tarthi, pull up libertygov.net for me please."

Libertygov.net pulls up.  Woah, 320,412 new messages.  Oh, right.  She was broadcasting the fight with the raiders.  I guess they're paying attention.

"Tarthi, submit new post."

-New Post Ready

"Tarthi, roll film"

Hi guys.  This is Admiral Santana floating back to home.  As you can see it's a little rough in the atmosphere right now.  I think I'm falling at about 534megalons per second.  Anyway, as you might have seen, I had a little run in with the Kartouri Raiders.  Good news is that the planet is safe and none of you are dead.  I can't wait to see you mom.  The bad news is that they blew up my ship.  I try not to ask you guys for too much, but seeing as I did just save the planet again if you could kindly upvote this so I can get a new ship and keep the planet safe that'd be really awesome.

I'm hoping for some improvements, so if a few megaloths could hit it with their megaloth balls or just DM some Liberty Scripts to my wallet that would be great.  I think the shields need moar power.  Also, I seem to have lost some crew so if you're ready to die to keep this place safe from the Karts then hit me up when I land.

Love you guys and thanks for your support.  

Peace, Abundance, and Liberty to you all.

Santana out.
