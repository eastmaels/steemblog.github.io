I continue to like Steem.  Neat place.  Neat idea.

The whales are acting a little better, but this whole place is isn't super stable.  The whales still have like 80-90% of the steem.   They have a desire to cash out because they like eating and paying rent and not living in their parents basements.  So, when the price goes up they will sell.  There aren't people ready to shove $40M into this blogging platform to offset the cost of that so the price will drop.  We are in a brief period of irrational exuberance where the increased price hasn't hit everyone yet so the whales haven't sold against it... yet.  The price will be back down to $0.10 in a week or two.  I'm looking forward to doubling the amount of steem I own in that time period.

Not financial advice fuckers.  Just me ranting.
