<p>I signed up for Gab today. &nbsp;And by signed up I mean got in the cue that's a million people long. &nbsp;It's apparently a twitter clone that doesn't silence users. &nbsp;That's big. &nbsp;I don't think it's block chain, so people might go back and edit shit, but at least it isn't currently controlled by the elites that control twitter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For example, the Twitter CEO is the moderator of a cannibalism group. &nbsp;That's weird. &nbsp;He also banned Pizzagate crowd sourced investigation. &nbsp;That's bad. &nbsp;Not that I'm going to impact them very much, but I'm going to leave twitter and switch to Gab as soon as I'm processed.</p>

<p>PS Gab isn't on the block and doesn't have a cryptocurrency attached so... it's not really like Steemit, but at least from a stand point of not censoring people that's a good start in my eyes.</p>
