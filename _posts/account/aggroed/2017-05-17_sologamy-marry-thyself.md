Woah,  here's an article about people choosing to marry themselves.  

Love is hard.  Marriage is work.  But this is pretty nutzo.  I mean I think of this as a real millennial thing.  You know, I identify as a gender fluid genital nuetral homeschooled fair trade vegan unicorn.  Since there aren't any others I'll marry myself too.  

I wonder how my wife and kids will feel about that...
