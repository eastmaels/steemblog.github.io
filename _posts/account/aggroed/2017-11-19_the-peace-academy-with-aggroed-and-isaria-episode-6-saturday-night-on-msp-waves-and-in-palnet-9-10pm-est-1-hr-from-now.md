The concepts of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty arenâ€™t taught to us as we grow up, yet they are some of the most important aspects of a healthy and thriving society.

Come join us for Episode 6 of the Peace Academy as we discuss why these important concepts are kept hidden, and talk about ways that we can bring Peace, Abundance, and Liberty into our lives and our communities.

***We also want to hear from you!*** 

Join our audience chat during the show and let us know if you want to come on air with us!
