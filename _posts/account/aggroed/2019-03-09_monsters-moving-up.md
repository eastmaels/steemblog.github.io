Look at that chart.  The lowest point is right when automated tournaments hit the test server.  Cards have gained $80k+ USD in value since then in under two weeks.

Now we're seeing Steem touching 50 cents.  That's a long way from $10 highs, but sure beats the recent lows.

I think both of those are bullish for Monsters!  I'm especially proud to see us turning around before Bitcoin.  That to me says wonderful things about our game, market, and community!  This is the longest bear market in the history of bitcoin, and we're pulling out ahead of schedule.  WOOT!

*If this is what we're doing in a bear market what do you think will happen when the bulls come back?*

## Tournament Payout

I think the reason has a lot to do with this!

It's been under 2 weeks and we're at $3800 paid out.  There's something magical about letting any player in a decentralized manner earn just through Playing Steem Monsters!  With tournament sponsors joining the mix we're seeing more prize pools!


## Dive into Steem Monsters!

With delegation coming soon it'll be easier than ever to earn while playing than ever before.  It's already live on the test server.  The full feature and markets around it will be here soon.  New players will have a much smaller barrier to entry to get started and hodlers will have a chance to passively earn while hodling and delegating cards!

I can't tell you what's best for you because I don't know your financial situation, but I'm stoked for the future!

If you're not playing now's the time to get in the game before market prices get out of reach.  If you are playing considering picking up a team for friends to play.  In the future they may be your guild mate!

I can't wait to see where it goes and I hope you're on the Steem Monsters Moon Ship with me!
