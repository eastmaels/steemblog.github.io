So, I'm going to be offering one of the biggest writing competitions on the block that I've seen on the block.  It'll go live in the next few days here.  I need help building out the lore of the game so I know what the campaign setting will look like.  In order to do that I wrote two documents.  The first is a process doc and the second is a template to use.

The Steem Monsters Discord group is here: https://discord.gg/CAFJRjY

Here's the process doc: https://hackmd.io/npOH7pi0TwqVg7gOVje5ww

Here's the Template.  Please don't edit my actual template.

## Value system inside the template

As part of the template doc I'm giving some weird instructions in order to fill out a value system for the various Splinters (colors).  I know that the instructions might be a little confusing so I put together a 2 minute video to describe how these things can work.  The values to me are the most important as it will inform the rest of the decisions that you make as you describe them.

This is what i came up with.  You're gonna need this in your template for review.

## Minor word of caution

The contest is a bunch of work.  It'll take a team.  If you make the team too big I can imagine a lot of fighting.  If you make the team too small I imagine a lot of work.  I think having 4-5 people is probably the right number of people to make getting the work done not too hard.  It's enough people to provide ideas, but maybe not clash entirely.  You're gonna want one person facilitating the discussion.  It will likely work best if they aren't super invested in the section they are facilitating.

After getting some of the values done and the basic backstory then I think it makes sense to break the template down into mini sections that a person is responsible for.  Claim what you want to write.  Collaborate where it's more than 1 person.  It's gonna be work, but it should be fun!
