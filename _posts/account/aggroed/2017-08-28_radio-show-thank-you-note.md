Folks, that was an incredibly fun radio show to run tonight!  I'm really grateful for the folks that showed up.  We had more than 40 Steemians with us tonight.  Sadly they weren't all concurrent, but we had a ton on the air and in the channel.

I gave away 40 hard earned SBD.  25 SBD went to @juliakponsford.  15 SBD went to @r0nd0n.  Julia is the newest moderator for the Minnow Support Project.  We're glad to have her on board!  Much congrats.  Such win!

We did a delegation.  I'm not ashamed to say I'm trying to catch @crimsonclad.  Her metal show topped 40 concurrent users on twitch.  I'm a wee bit competitive so my plan is to save up the SP from this week from Witnessing and pump it into a big prize pool to give away on the radio show.  So, I think my radio show this time next week will have a 1k delegation tied to it!

I also shared that if anyone is able to get more than 40 concurrent users on their show this coming week I'll delegate 250 SP to the radio show host or to the person of their choice.

During the show I ran a contest to recruit people to the show.  If they shared who recruited them I put them in a drawing for SP delegation.  That was won by @kubbyelizabeth and she chose to share it with @choogirl (Choo was teh person she recruited to the show tonight).  Because she chose to share and I like the attitude I delegated 150 SP to each of them.  @swelker101 kicked in too.  He delegated 50 SP to them both, also because she chose to share her prize!  That's how you game the prisoner's dilemna folks to promote a sharing culture!

And we played  a lot of rock and roll!  I love doing this!  Thanks for attending.  THanks for participating.  Thanks for giving music requests.  Thanks for riding the waves!
