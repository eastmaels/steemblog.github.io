It's MLK day. So, let's remember MLK Jr.  

![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUcL4wZMn8PyWwB9RaRnXd1d6sNbrqP4DLyGjLmaRvZbc/image.png)

He was a peace activist that rallied a nation towards non-violence to end segregation.  He was a strong leader with a religious inspiration and calling to share an alternate vision for the world - "I have a dream that my four little children will one day be judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."  He's most remembered for the "I Have a Dream" speech he delivered in Washington DC.

## Did you know the King family had a civil trial regarding his assassination? <h2>

So, here's a few facts.  MLK Jr. was assassinated.  Later there was a trial where the jury unanimously decided there was a conspiracy to kill MLK Jr. that included to mob/mafia and the US government, the government of the State of Tennessee,  City of Memphis, the Memphis Police Department, the Government of Shelby County, Tennessee, and later a higher court repealed the decision of the lower court.

## The court case in Dec 1999 <h2>

Throughout part of November and December in 1999 a civil trial was held.

THE CIRCUIT COURT OF SHELBY COUNTY, TENNESSEE
THIRTIETH JUDICIAL DISTRICT AT MEMPHIS
_____________________________________________
CORETTA SCOTT KING, MARTIN
LUTHER KING, III, BERNICE KING,
DEXTER SCOTT KING and YOLANDA KING,
Plaintiffs,
Vs. Case No. 97242-4 T.D.
LOYD JOWERS and OTHER UNKNOWN
CO-CONSPIRATORS, 

## Mrs. Correta Scott King said this after the verdict was released<h2>

"There is abundant evidence of a major high level conspiracy in the assassination of my husband, Martin Luther King, Jr. And the civil court's unanimous verdict has validated our belief."

She continues- "The jury was clearly convinced by the extensive evidence that was presented during the trial that, in addition to Mr. Jowers, the conspiracy of the Mafia, local, state and federal government agencies, were deeply involved in the assassination of my husband. The jury also affirmed overwhelming evidence that identified someone else, not James Earl Ray, as the shooter, and that Mr. Ray was set up to take the blame."

If you'd like 2750 pages of light reading on the court case check out this [full transcript](http://www.thekingcenter.org/sites/default/files/KING%20FAMILY%20TRIAL%20TRANSCRIPT.pdf).

## A few neat highlights <h2>

Regarding Mr. James Earl Ray, the man largely thought to have killed MLK Jr:  "What [the judge] left out was the fact that Ray said, yes, legally guilty, legally guilty. He was legally because he was copping a plea, so he was legally guilty. He never confessed. The media has always said he confessed, the confessed killer. He never confessed. He always insisted that he didn't do it."


King Family Attorney: Mr. Glankler (the man who headed the investigation) sat in that chair. I just gave him a sampling of names, gave him twenty-three names. Do you recall that? I asked him if he interviewed these people in  his investigation, these witnesses with vital evidence that you've heard, twenty-three. Do you know how many he actually interviewed? I recall I think it was two. That's the investigation the Attorney General's Office did. That just speaks for itself."

## There is a lot too this <h2>

It's complicated.  And I'm not an expert.  I'm amazed the King family doesn't have more to say after a higher court overturned the ruling.  They clearly feel that this trial nailed it and correctly identified that there was a larger conspiracy at play than a lone gunman.  

It's something to dig into on MLK Jr. Day.  Until then let's keep working on a world filled with Peace, Abundance, and Liberty for all inhabitants of this planet.
