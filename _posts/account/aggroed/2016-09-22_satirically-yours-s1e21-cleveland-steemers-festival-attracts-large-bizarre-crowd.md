<p>After the roaring success of the STEEMFEST concept many cities have decided to take the bull by the horn and rally around STEEMIT, an infant organization that combines blogging, crypto-currency, Twitter, and a news feed. &nbsp;Cleveland is no exception. &nbsp;The local mayor Bill Snedly, reformed alcoholic, life coach, and tee-shirt entrepreneur, is proud to host the event.</p>

<p>"The city may have fallen upon hard times following the abrupt introduction of the automobile allowing local residents to sprawl outwards for miles and still commute into the city, but that just provides an abandoned area of town that we are happy to rent out for practically next to nothing. &nbsp;Also, you don't have to wait long at restaurants, so it's basically win-win for everyone."</p>
<p>He did offer several comments about the choice of name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm not sure that's exactly what they really want to call the event, but they contacted me a little late to inform them of their <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cleveland+Steamer">poor choice of words</a>."</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to one co-host, Jake Shartmayer, Cleveland Steamer has other implications.</p>

<p>"I can't wait to get down here and see all the Cleveland STEEMERS in action. &nbsp;I want to get up close and interact with them while they're forcing out that next story. &nbsp;I'm just excited. &nbsp;Can you smell the anticipation over this event. &nbsp;We're definately going to put the Cleveland STEEMERS Festival on the map."</p>
<p>After the event he and co-host, who goes by Schmitty, seemed more withdrawn.</p>

<p>"There's no way to get that out of my head" he shared. &nbsp;"This event attracted 450 people... Do you know how many came to blog? &nbsp;3. &nbsp;Just 3. &nbsp;And two of us were the cohosts. &nbsp;I can't begin to tell you the things I saw in there. &nbsp;I'm going to have nightmares for years. &nbsp;It was... was..." and then he broke into sobs.</p>
<p>It remains unclear if the event will run again next year, but there are at least 447 people that are excited for that to happen.</p>
