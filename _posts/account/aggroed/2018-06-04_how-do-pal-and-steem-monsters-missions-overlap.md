I'm the founder of the Minnow Support Project which has a home in a Discord group called the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network](minnowpond.org).  It has a very simple mission statement:  To spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, to grow the Steem ecosystem and to train and retain Minnows on the platform.  This is a public community with no commercial enterprise and focuses on giving away money and resteems in the weekly contest, votes and resteems for community curation, and free votes for any non-banned Steemian on the platform that wants a few pennies to help them get started.

Steem Monsters is different for sure.  It's a business that sells a game.  It may or may not surprise you, but the true mission of Steem Monsters is very much rooted in the same sentiment and mission statement of PAL/MSP.  Besides making money in a commercial venture what are the goals of Steem Monsters?

## Value Overlap

We're going to spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty through creative story telling and provide good and bad examples of how communities can be.  We'll poke fun at systems that don't support these values or have them bring ruin in the story telling of the game.

We're going to use this platform to bring new people onto the platform and grow the Steem ecosystem.  I don't mean to scoop myself... but we're hiring a Director of Social Media today.  He's going to run contests outside of Steem to steal cryptokitty fans to our platform, get people from bitcoin and eos to get interested in Steem, and maybe spend a little time trying to capture fiat normies and get them into crypto too.  We're going to bring new users and we're going to try to be the best app on the blockchain at bringing new users here.

Training and retaining new members:  I'm not sure training is going to fit into this, but we're building the game with the idea that retention kinda sucks right now and we need to improve it.  Not everyone can earn post rewards every day, but we can make it through daily quests that everyone on the chain has a chance to earn more monsters and level them up and then sell them to one another.  Here's another way to earn even if you're not simply posting.  Some may prefer that frankly.


## This was preemptive question answering

So, honestly not too many people have challenged me wondering what the goal of both of these groups are, but to me the mission is highly synergistic.  Should be overwhelming and tons of fun to steer the biggest online community on Steemit and the fastest growing application out there.

Good Times!

## Shilling

If you want to see Steem Monsters grow we need more time from Yabapmatt and that should be easier to make happen if homeboy is a top 20 witness.  I'm asking that you go vote for him and help us get him a steady income to free up his time to work on Monsters and other block chain developments.
