So, [this story](https://steemit.com/steemmonsters/@road2nowhere/twisted-jester-steemmonsters-origins) is literally my favorite short story I've read on Steem in the last two years.  I'm aware I could be biased because it's about a character in the game I'm creating, but this story... It's so dark and so good.

It's the origin story of the Twisted Jester one of the Monsters in the Steem Monsters game.  I enjoyed the fan fiction so much that we're going to use it as the backstory/lore of the card.  I read this on Isaria and Swelker101's show the other night.  So I decided to record it this evening.  Here's my performance.  I hope you enjoy it...
