<p>Every year at Thanksgiving my mother had one tradition that was held above all others. &nbsp;You would share one thing you were thankful for. &nbsp;You can share more than one, but you have to share one. &nbsp;If you see this post, please write one thing you are thankful for in the comments below.</p>

<p>I had a spontaneous recovery from a mental health issue that lastest 10 years a little over a year ago. &nbsp;It's brought back my marriage from the brink, a better relationship with my kids, a new job is likely, I spend more time with my friends, my creativity is back, and I think I no longer cause harm by default. &nbsp;I'm extremely lucky to be healthy again and feel capable of using the many skills and gifts that are returning and have returned to help others. &nbsp;It happened after my daughter gave me reiki. &nbsp;So, I'm super grateful to her and for her.</p>
