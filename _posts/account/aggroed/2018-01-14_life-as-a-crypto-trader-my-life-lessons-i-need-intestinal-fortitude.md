So, I wrote one piece in honor of the crypto traders not too long ago.  Quite frankly this thing takes balls.  Not just man balls, it can be giant lady balls too, or whale balls.  The PC expression is intestinal fortitude, and it comes with an apology to everyone currently without intestines.  You're people too, and can also be brave.  What I'm saying is risking lots of money in a unstable market especially while my monthly bills comes out of this is borderline terrifying.

## @haejin <h2>

I'm not sure if he's nutz or not.  He might be accurate.  Some think he's a quack.  He might be picking winners in a bull market.  I haven't fully made up my mind, but I do think that he has a fairly deep understanding of the principles he's talking about.  He does have some useful thoughts and certainly has some eyes on him.  Whether technical analysis or anything else is better than asking my lucky 8-ball I don't know.  

Here's his post from earlier today.  It's called his [third alternate count.](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@haejin/bitcoin-btc-morning-update-a-third-alternate-count)

Notice the nose diving red.  I just quit my job to do this full time.  Rough start would be a few days after that realize that we were at a rather extraordinary high for the moment, but having not sold off about to get hit with a brutal couple of whacks from the reality tree.

## The positive upside <h2>

He talks about the positive upside in this graph-

## The negative potential <h2>

That one looks a little grim for a guy who didn't cash some out at the top and so has nothing handy to buy the dip.

Seems as though the universe is providing multiple pathways forward and the question is which one will manifest.

## Here's what happened today <h2>

## I started shitting my pants roughly here <h2>

We plummeted to the resistance line.  That was scary. 


## I had cleaned up after my self here <h2>

## Only to then totally reshit my pants here <h2>

I'm literally thinking "if this goes any further I'm panic selling all of this shit."

## Crypto trading is hard on the nerves <h2>

Look, it's one thing when I had a job and could just ride this shit out and not worry too much about the ups and downs because I didn't have to cash some of this shit out to live.  Now I pay rent with this.  I gotta say, it's fucking nerve wracking.  Here's hoping the market goes up, jaws of wealth, triangles, and all the goodness that comes with that.  I'm gonna be the first one cashing out fat stacks to fiat when the correction rights.

## This is simply a long toast to the people that have done this a while <h2>

Maybe it's because I'm new and untested that it's extra scary to do this with mortgage money rather than simply lunch money, but being in this market is a mix of excilerating and terrifying.  To the people that have held themselves together (pun intended) I tip my hat, I share my high regards, and will look to summon the will and the balls to do well at this.  Cheers.  Many blessings of lambos to you all.
