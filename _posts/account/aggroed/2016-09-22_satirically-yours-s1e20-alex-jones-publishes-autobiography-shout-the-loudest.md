<p>Infowars TV and radio host and avid conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was excited to announce his brand new book titled "SHOUT THE LOUDEST." &nbsp;In this book he talks about the best way to handle interviewing B list celebrities and news anchors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"While many people think the best approach when trying to have a public discourse over hot topics is to try to see a perspective from the other persons point of view I ascribe to a different philosophy. &nbsp;I've found over the years that the single best thing I can do for the movement is to shout over anybody with an opposite point of view." Alex pleasently mentions this during the interview.</p>
<p>When we pressed him on how he came up with that philosophy the interview nearly ended "ARE YOU KIDDING ME? &nbsp;SERIOUSLY, ARE YOU KIDDING ME RIGHT NWO? &nbsp;I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE FACTS. &nbsp;FACTS ARE FACTS. &nbsp;YOU CAN'T DEBATE THEM, BUT HERE YOU ARE ASKING ME QUESTIONS ABOUT MY OPINION? &nbsp;WHO DO YOU WORK FOR? &nbsp;THE CLINTONS? TRUMP? &nbsp;IT HAS TO BE ONE OF THEM. &nbsp;DO YOU WORSHIP MULOCH? &nbsp;ARE YOU AT BOHEMIAN GROVE? &nbsp;WHO SENT YOU?"</p>
<p>Rather than continuing the conversation and being involuntarily covered in saliva Satirically Yours correspondent @aggroed instead decided to politely back out of the conversation with the obviously irratable and unstable man.</p>
<p>"DON'T YOU SEE. &nbsp;THIS IS WHY WE SHOUT. &nbsp;WE WON. &nbsp;WE WON YOU SON OF A BITCH. &nbsp;AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN AGAINST THE GOD DAMN ILLUMINATI WHO ARE COMING FOR YOUR GUNS, WHO ARE COMING FOR YOUR FREEDOMS, WHO HAVE ENSLAVED YOU. &nbsp;RESIST! &nbsp;RESIST! &nbsp;RESIST"</p>
