Well, everyday I stay in the top 20 my witness will generate 200+ steem.  While I have a monthly bill for the server, it's not nearly as large as that.  My plan is to delegate the vast majority of my steem to support minnows.  I'll do that by delegating to @minnowsupport, the moderators of the Minnow Support Project, minnows in the PALnet community, and bots that the community uses to promote good stuff coming out of the community.

For people, my plan will be to delegate steem to Minnows until they become dolphins, remove the delegation and move on to the next minnow to help them grow.  This may be different for Moderators and Medal of Honor winners as they have more activity in the community than average members.

That said, starting with tonight I've delegated 1,000 SP to muh baby, @minnowsupport.  I'm so excited to see it grow.

## Contest <h2>

There are three general groups that I'll be delegating too.

PALnet community Leaders
PALnet bots
PALnet minnows 

This contest will run for two days and award a 500 SP delegation to a Minnow of the community's choosing.  To vote please type the names of 1-2 minnows in the comment section.  Most votes wins.  Tie goes to value of the comment.  You can self vote here.  

Minnow must have earned less than 5k SP
Minnow must have less than 1000 followers
Minnow can't be a witness, mod, or medal of honor winner

## Good Luck and I'll keep this up as long as I'm in the top spots! <h2>

PS if you don't know what delegation is- I can lend you my steem power.  You benefit from the curation and get stronger votes.  I don't actually lose the SP.  It's a great arrangement to support minnows.
