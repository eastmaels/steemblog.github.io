The news is pumping out a lot of disclosure stories especially about high level human trafficking.  Distractions are at epic proportions.  This David Hogg thing is amazing.  They don't care how exposed he's getting or how in your face the lie is.  They keep pushing the story because it keeps our attention.  The question is what's going on underneath David Hogg.  So, I'll present to you today Meme the News and Qanon.  We'll see how long I can keep two morning news meme posts going.

On a side note I would add that I subscribe to the @haejin theory that crypto prices are quantized.  This is a phenomina that invovles the universal consciousness.  I also subscribe to the idea that there are patterns and these things come in waves.  As I stare at the chart showing that the resistance line we've been on for the last for months, meets the support line we've been on for 5 months or more somehwere in the middle of htis month I think things are going to break up or down.  Zerohedge has been reporting that some folks are looking for billions of dollars of btc right now.  I'm betting it's going to break upwards, but it also suggests that something big is going to happen to push cryptos back up to highs if not all time highs... What could it be?  Well, I think the crypto prices are a front runner for some epic news that's going to hit us all.  This should be an amazing month to be a news hound.
