OOOOOOHHH BOY!  It's been a fun week.  You're watching the price of SBD start to moon.  I think I'm in the minority in the USA that believes it's about to double within the week, but that's what I'm thinking.  Should be fun.  HODL!!!

We had the Steem Panel Discussion this week.  Lots going on there.  Talk of SBDs and Witnesses and Bias- OH MY!

Just another crazy week in the land of crypto.  Anywho... looking forward to my show that's going live in about 30 minutes.

## How to listen <h2>

The show takes place on mspwaves.com/listen and also in the PALnet Discord channel: https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw

If you want to chat during the show go here: https://discord.gg/hesUJmg
If you want to listen to the show in Discord go here: https://discord.gg/pGHjVtc
If you want to talk on the show go here: https://discord.gg/hesUJmg

Make sure you have a working mic and a headset.  Ain't nobody want your station feedback.

## What can you talk about <h2>

Anything!  Promote yourself, introduce yourself, talk about the platform, talk about a project, play an instrument, sing (don't over power the mic as it doesn't sound great in Discord).  

## How can you say it? <h2>

This is a peace channel.  you're willing to complain and be upset about stuff, but just make sure if you come on air that you speak out against actions as opposed to people or Steemit as a company.

## 250 SP Delegation <h2>

If you come on air you are eligible for a delegation.  We'll roll it randomly and if your number is picked you'll get 250Sp delegated to you for a long time (usually 6 months or until you're no longer a minnow).

## 50 Steem for Dice Bitches <h2>

I'm feeling a little flush with cash because of the Steem Panel Discussion and looking forward to spreading the wealth back to the people.  So, we'll play Dice Bitches, and maybe even add a few straight up top rolls to win some additional monies.

to play wait for me to roll `t!dice 15d15` and then you copy that command.  If you tie or beat me you go onto the next round.  Next round will be `t!dice 14d14` and so on.  If I win we'll start over and play again.  If I win twice I'll send the money to msp-waves.
