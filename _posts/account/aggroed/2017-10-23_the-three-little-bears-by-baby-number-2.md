A few months back my oldest child was able to write a story and I ended up paying out the rewards in cash.  Tonight my youngest daughter finally gets a turn.  So, I proudly present to you my 5-year old's story:  The Three Little Bears

## The Three Little Bears <h2>

So, the littlest bear got lost in the forest.  He couldn't tell where his home was.  And the little bear looked and looked for his home, but he couldnt' find it.  So, he searched in the forest and he found a candy home.  He didn't know what was inside.  He goed into the garden and went inside.  There was a nasty old witch named Ginger.  She looks very nice and sometimes is very nice, but at other times she is nasty.

The middle bear went out into the forest, but she got lost.  So, she looked and looked and found another candy house.  She looked inside, and there was a wizard.  The wizard is very nice, but the wizard is very mad.  He was mad because he couldn't get his potion right.

The biggest bear went out in the forest and got lost.  They found another candy house.  The biggest bear went into the garden and goed in.  The bear saw a big wizard who accidentally turned himself into a mouse.  The mouse was very nice, but was actually a wizard, so, the big bear saw that the wizard's spell kept turning him into other animals: bears, mice, and any animal you can think of.  The wizard gave the big bear his wand, and that wand only worked with rhymes.  So, the animal wizard told the big bear what you have to do to make the wand go.

The wizard said "diddalee do, and make this potion stop boiling in two."  The big bear said that and turned the wizard back into a person.  And then all of a sudden the wand made all of the bears poof back home.
