Minnow Mayor Town Hall- What's up my Fishes!!!  Looks like it's Sunday night again and that means Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  I don't have special guests lined up this week.  I'm trying to lock some in for my Qanon forum on Saturday and that's taking precedence.  We'll see who shows up.  

## What's teh show?

I run the Minnow Support Project.  It's a public gathering place created by me, run by many top witnesses, and managed daily by a team of about a dozen moderators.  Inside of that we have a streaming internet broadcast station called MSP-Waves.  It's housed in the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel aka PALnet](minnowpond.org).  This show is to give everyone a chance to talk to me.  It started as a way for Steemians to raise concerns about the Steem ecosystem or the Minnow Support Project, but it has quickly morphed into a talent showcase, a poetry reading, a place to make an introduction, and a million other things.

## 5 minutes

Anyone on the block that hasn't been banned from teh Minnow Support Project is welcome to come on air and talk to us about practically anything.  Only thing you can't do is intentionally be a dick, but otherwise it's all good.  Talk about whatever you want, promote whatever, perform whatever, ask about witness stuff, or MSP.  It's a Muppet show, but I love it and hopefully you'll enjoy it too.

## Logistics

Show starts in 1 hour at 9pm EST, which is 0100 UTC
It's in the PALnet Discord

Hop into Discord
Slide into the mspwaves-audience channel
Hop in the room with all the people to hear the show

If you want to go on air then hop into the waiting room

Anyone going on air needs to have headphones and a mic.

## Delegation

I stopped doing personal delegation, but you have a chance to get on an auto-vote through msp-active.  If you're active in chat or the radio ask me about it and we'll see if you're a good fit.

## Dice Bitches

25 SBD up for grabs.  Rules to be explained later.

See you soon
