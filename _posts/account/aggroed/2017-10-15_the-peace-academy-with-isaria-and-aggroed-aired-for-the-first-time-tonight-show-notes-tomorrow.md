# <center> *Self-Care and Inner Peace* </center>


---

The first step to achieving peace with others is to first find peace within ourselves.
Self-care and inner peace go hand in hand.
*We must first secure our own oxygen masks before assisting others.*
If we arenâ€™t taking care of ourselves we can experience a multitude of problems that can not only affect our inner selves, but our relationships with others as well:

* Anxiety
* Burn-out
* Health problems
* Problems sleeping
* Problems with mental clarity
* Frustration
* Negative Thoughts
* Arguments


---

We all lead very busy lives and building a successful Steemit account can sometimes feel like a full time job.  
The following self-care tips are a gentle reminder of what we all should be doing in order to lead healthy lives and achieve a sense of inner peace:

* Get the amount of sleep that you need to feel rested
* Eat as healthy as possible
* Exercise regularly
* Take some time for yourself to relax


---

Once we have these basic essential needs covered then we can spend some time on self-renewal and inner peace:

* Meditation - Many people get overwhelmed by this concept.  All you need to do is sit quietly for 10 minutes a day and attempt to clear your mind of mundane concerns.
* Write down what you are grateful for
* Keep a journal of dreams and goals
* Read
* Listen to music
* Laugh
* Spend time with friends and loved ones
* Help others
* Make a daily list of your concerns and/or things to do so they aren't constantly floating around in your head in an unorganized way causing stress.
* If you feel overwhelmed with many things to do then create a schedule and stick to it.
* Take a break from Steemit!
