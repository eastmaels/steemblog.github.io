hey party people.  Getting ready to go on air this evening.  I'm thinking topics will include scot, splinterlands, minnowsupport, and steem alliance.  whole thing is a little random, and a good chance to vent.  Maybe I'll just shout at people for a few hours.  

Anyway, hopefully you know the drill by now.  Mspwaves.com is the website for the interactive broadcast station that r0nd0n manages.  you can listen to the show at mspwaves.com/listen or go into palnet at minnowpond.org.

I might let people on the show to say funny things... maybe I'll pick some fights.  We'll see.  Anyway, you're all lovely people and I can't wait to see you there.
