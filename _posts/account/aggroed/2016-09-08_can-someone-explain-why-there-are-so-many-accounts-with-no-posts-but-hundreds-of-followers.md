<p>So, I'm confused. &nbsp;When I scroll through my upvoters I see that a fair number of them have something like 0 blog posts and 200 plus followers. &nbsp;What is that? &nbsp;Why is that happening? &nbsp;Are these just backup accounts for whales? &nbsp;Are these witnesses that got a following but aren't accounts for posting? &nbsp;This is a weird part of STEEMIT that I don't understand and if someone way more techy than me can chime in that would be great.</p>
