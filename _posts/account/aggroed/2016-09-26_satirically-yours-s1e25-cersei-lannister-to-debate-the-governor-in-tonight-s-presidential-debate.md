<p>In this evening's live scheduled debate two epic villains are set to debate for our nation's future. &nbsp;Representing the red team we have "The Governor" and representing the blue team we have Cersei Lannister.</p>
<p>General rules of the debate include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>No outright murder of the other candidate by poison, gunshot, zombie infection, or general explosives. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Candidates must stand at their podiums and may not use armed or armored guards to subdue their opponents (this also includes living, dead, and reanimated guards).</li>
  <li>No sacrificing debate onlookers for political points or to hide private commentary not meant to be released to the public.</li>
  <li>Candidates will have 90 minutes to debate with questions alternating between them. &nbsp;Only perspectives from these two candidates will be allowed (Captain Planet and the Big Lebowski will not be allowed to participate).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Captain Planet and Big Lebowski react to debate exclusion.</strong></p>
<p>In general it's believed that Cersei will bring up a number of policy points. &nbsp;She's concerned about the massive debt the nation faces. &nbsp;She's concerned about the number of impoverished citizens living in castle walls. &nbsp;She's a family first candidate and wants to ensure that her family continues to progress in leadership positions. &nbsp;She wants to see women gain traction in the world and fight religious intolerance.</p>
<p>The Governor is expected to bring up several instances where she outright murders her political opponents sometimes in mass casualty events. &nbsp;He will likely discuss her hawkish policies. &nbsp;He will likely discuss the general lack of trust in the statements she makes outwardly vs the actions she takes privately. &nbsp;Many are concerned how she's exposed some of the highest kept state secrets through her careless use of ravens.</p>
<p>The Governor is thought to bring up national defense and security. &nbsp;He's concerned about the droves of dangerous plague infested zombies to the south and thinks border controls are necessary to safeguard the nation. &nbsp;He will talk about he will be tough on crime and use all necessary force to root out potential domestic threats. &nbsp;He will talk about the glory days of a post-infection world where people can still live in peace and harmony under a watchful and highly armed eye.</p>
<p>Many believe that Cersei will talk about how some of his previous ventures have failed. &nbsp;She'll discuss his unusual habits including keeping severed heads in his private living quarters. &nbsp;She'll talk about his xenophobic behavior patterns. She'll also discuss how he appears to not have concrete plans, but instead just makes up his approach as he moves along following whatever path leads to his highest personal gains.</p>
<p>The stakes are high and Satirically Yours waits with anticipation to see which villain the American people will elect.</p>
