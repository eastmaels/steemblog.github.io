So, last night I changed over to HF20.  I went to sleep.  My witness is still running without any issue.  That's a great startintg point!!!

I know we're in a bear market, but I'm extremely bullish on Steem.  The onramp is getting improved drastically.  Communities will be easier than ever to form and maintain.  And tokens are coming.  

I'm stoked for tokens!!!  This isn't just about shitcoins . It's about the ability to aggregate capital.  You can easily form a business on steem.  Just create an account, but you can't easily do a capital raise.  Tokens will change that.  People will come here to make a token and raise capital.  Money will flow in through Steem raising the price of steem.

When moon?  ---> Tokens


## HF 20 first, Tokens in March

Tokens come in March.  You have a few more months to gobble up bear market Steem.  Then it's gonna get harder.

So, I'm excited.  I tried to be the first witness running HF20, but I had a flight from Miami to Boston that got in the way.  Right now I'm one of only 2.  Me and brother Aus!  MSP in the HF20 HOUSE!!!


## Why Steem is different

In all the other cryptos every time there's a disagreement you can assume there will be a fork.  At that time you can look around and roughly half your community is gone.  That's not the case here.  People come and go with the seasons and the price and faith in leadership, but there's one chain.  

We all go to the same Moon!

We're not forking new chains.  So, make peace with your neighbor.  We're gonna be together for a long time.

## Tokenfest Boston

So, I gotta run.  I'm manning a TokenFest Steem booth and showcasing Steem Monsters in it with @yabapmatt (you should vote for his witness if you don't).  It'll be a fun day talking to blockchain dudes and crypto hounds all day.  Who knows what'll happen, but I gotta get dressed and get ready....


So, HF20 is up and running on my Witness.

What you just read isn't financial advice.  I don't know you or your family's financial situation.  It's impossible to tell you what to do.  Nor is it financial advice to say directly or imply indirectly that you should SODL your house and HODL some monsters.  I mean... what do those words even mean...  Just crypto responsibly and don't invest in ICOs with money you owe a loanshark.
