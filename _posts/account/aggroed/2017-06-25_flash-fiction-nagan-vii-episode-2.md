I started a flash fiction post the other day while on the train.  I saw a book I read years ago and remembered its' been a while since I wrote any fiction.  Peeps seemed to enjoy it, but liked the short series Nagan VII more than the others.  Here's the post.  Folks liked it enough that they asked for more.  Who am I to say no?

Here's the initial story that came from there.

## Nagan VII <h2>

Admiral Santana looked down at the blinking red screen in front of her. Every dashboard lit up with colored lights. Her training had prepared her for the lights, but not the doom. The sinking doom of the Kartouri raiders above her home. Four billion hearts pulsed below her, and four billion hearts needed her to live. She slid from her chair as gas hissed out at her from a broken circulation tube. She cleared her best friend's corpse from the weapons display. She can cry about that tomorrow if she lives, but not today. Shaft 7-9 were empty. Shaft 3-6 were broken. Shaft 1-3 were working, but only 2 had a balistic ready to fire. She pursed her lips with a vengeful smile. Quantom sliders were illegal for a reason... but this was home. She clicked the keys and entered her private key and watched as the lone torpedo flew from her ship; a last gasping trail of ice and hope behind it.

## Episode 2 <h2>

60 seconds ago Captain Tanic Elotaw of the Dreadnaught class ship Peace Enforcer 782215 was an extremely happy man.  
55 seconds ago he had damaged just about every last weapon system of the terrorist flagship Unsanctioned Peace Defiance 01500-7. 
50 seconds ago his chief weapons officer had successfully taken their main thrusters offline with a precision rail gun disabling impact.  
45 seconds ago he recorded a highly dampened energy signal suggesting the ship's main power was severely compromised.  
40 seconds he saw all the shields finally go offline.  
35 seconds ago he saw a life form readout suggesting that 72% of the suspected lifeforms had been neutralized.  
30 seconds ago he received a surrender message from Planet 143-2 in known system 45-66-2, the main host of the terrorist insurrection 15-11889-302.   
25 seconds ago his chief medical officer confirmed Admiral Santana was still alive and would be available for detention and interrogation.  
20 seconds ago there was a heat signature launched from the terrorist vessel.  
15 seconds ago counter measures were taken.  
10 seconds ago those counter measures failed to destroy the ballasitc.  
5 seconds ago a sphere emanated from the warhead.  
Now he was no longer happy.

Tanic tugged down on the bottom of his stiff uniform.  Calm and control was needed.  He realized while looking at his display that the ballastic was likely a quantum slider, and he was likely in a parallel dimension in an unknown time and space along with approximately 62% of his ship that happened to be enveloped in the slide.  If enough of the ship was left in tact a supra reality frequency jump through a quantum singularity might get him back.  Normally, he'd be pissed, but 3 peace keeping zero gravity advanced targeted thrust tubes (torpedoes) were launched before slider impact and the last readouts on his screen suggested they escaped the slide sphere.  3 red blips were on their way to eliminate the threat imposed by the Peace Defiance vessel and "Admiral" Santana was likely littered over space as 1,000 or more frozen blood, bone, and flesh debris floating into nothingness .  

One engine should be enough to get back, but will he get back at the right time to see her die with his very own eyes?
