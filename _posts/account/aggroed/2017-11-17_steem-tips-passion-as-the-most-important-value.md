I've been hiring people for the last few weeks in a higher ed sales role.  As I continue to think about it I keep coming back to passion as the single most important aspect of hiring for me.  I see that with the witnesses and mods that I work with on the Steem platform and I see that in the hiring I'm doing for my terrestial job.

## What is passion? <h2>

It's the burning desire to see something change.  For me I got sick to my stomach watching student after student fall victim to debt slavery.  They don't tell you that 1/2 of all entering students will drop out of college at the admissions meetings.  They don't really care.  They want your 50 grand.  If you graduate that's a bonus, but if you don't... idgaf....

So, I have a burning desire to try to help students that get suckered into going to college make it through with as little time and money spent in the education system as possible.  You tack into that the fact that jobs don't find much correlation with success with a college ed degree and you can start to get a sense of why even though I'm in the industry I'm not really a giant fan.

So, every day I get up and go to work it's not making another stupid call, or writing another god damn prof another stupid email.  Instead I'm working on a mission to help students find success in college and minimize their debt burden/slavery.  It's that burning injustice in the world that gets me up and working.

## Passion on Steemit <h2>

I spend hours of my life thinking of ways to grow the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network.  I'm already thinking about how I can turn hosting the Steem Growth Forum into the Crypto Growth Forum and help bring other crypto networks into the steem ecosystem.  I work a full time jobs, have a wife, have a house, have kids, and I still find 20-40 hrs a week for Steem related things.  I'm on the train on my way home from work now.  Where am I?  mspsteem.com typing away.

My point is that my success and that of PALnet or MSP or even Steem as a collective is going to be based on our collective will to get shit done, and that will be determined by the passion with which we have at this.

## So, as you're grinding out your way on Steem keep in mind your passions <h2>

You're not just commenting to gain followers.  You're commenting to gain followers to help a liberty movement.
You're not just posting to make some side cash.  You're posing to make some side cash and have resources to help other people.
You're not just making art for fun.  You're making art because it gives you flexibility in life and you can expand minds.

I guess my point is to hone your passion and make sure that you're diving in.  Steem is a rough ecosystem to half ass as there is tons of noise.  If you give this a strong go and have some solid writing skills you should be able to make some headway if you keep at it.  So, hone your passion and keep at it.

## What are some ways to do this? <h2>

I encourage people to write a problem statement.  Find something about the world you want to change.
Create a vision statement: Write about how the world will look different if you have your way.
Create a mission statement: Make 1 key decision.  What are you working on.  It'll make all of your other decisions easy.
Create a plan and start executing.  Make some short term goals and figure out what's achievable and how you make progress.

If you're committed to solving the problem in the world you'll find a way to make the changes you're hoping for.
