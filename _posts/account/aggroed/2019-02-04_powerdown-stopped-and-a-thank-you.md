Hey Ned,  

Glad to see that the powerdown has stopped.  I know it restarted back on programmatic selling, and I have no qualms with that.  Thanks for stopping the major powerdown.  I think it's an important step to healing the divide between Steemit and frustrated witnesses, large stake holders, and sections of the community at large.

I want to express my gratitude not only for that, but also your changes regarding how you're interacting with the community.  

I expressed 4 major problems a few weeks ago: Fiscal management, communication, open development process, and mass adoption.  Additionally, Tim has had concerns around transparency, and Jesta has shared concerns around accountability.

I can't speak for them, but I think I see improvement in every category.  I think some of the mindset at Steemit has shifted.  So far it's looking better now than it was a few weeks ago.  Nice job!  Change isn't easy.  It took a while to get here, but I'm feeling much better about this whole thing these days.

I want to add that @elipowell is doing a great job helping to mend some old challenges and build some new pathways that feel more inclusive than the previous approaches.  I was excited to see Vandeberg come on air too during Pennsif's forum.  That seems like another great step in the right direction towards changing the culture around Steemit.

I'm looking forward to seeing transparency reports.  I'm looking forward to figuring out ways that Steemit and the many Dapps can work together to grow this ecosystem.  I'm pleased seeing how these changes that seem to have taken root and show a little light.

I'll continue doing my best to grow this ecosystem through Apps and Communities.  Let me know if there are specific ways that I can help or how I could be of service.

Overall, this seems like a good start at a real turnaround and I'm looking forward to watching it play out.

Keep it up!  

Aggroed
