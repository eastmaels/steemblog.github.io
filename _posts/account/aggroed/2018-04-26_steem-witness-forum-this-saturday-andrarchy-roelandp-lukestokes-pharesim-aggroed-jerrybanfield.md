I'm pleased to announce the monthly Top 20 Steem Witness Forum.  Every Saturday at 11am EST (1500 UTC) I host a Top 20 Steem Witness Forum.  We generally spend the first 30 min or so talking with @andrarchy who gives us some ideas of what he's working on as Director of Content for Steemit inc.  After that the Witnesses will discuss what they are working on and think is important to consider for the block.

This is a fairly open discussion.  I'm not trying to manage the other witnesses so much as give everyone a platform to talk about develops as they are happening and some things that should be considered.  I'll ask open ended questions as prompts for the Witnesses to describe what they think is important.

@andrarchy has asked people to ask some questions in advance that the community is interested in.  He's also requested that you don't simply ask questions regarding timelines of the things in development.  

I'm still looking for a backup witness for this discussion.  So if you're in the top 50 and interested in participating please message me through Discord.

## Logistics

11am EST, 1500 UTC
Location: [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel](minnowpond.org)
you can also listen at mspwaves.com/listen

## Guests

Please come a few minutes early and make sure that your mic and headset are working.  Most important thing is that the speakers don't feed into the mic.

## Code of Conduct

All questions are allowed.  We're not thought police, but we can be pretty strict about not being intentionally rude to others.  You have the rest of the internet for that, but not here.  Please act respectful especially when asking anything contentious or we'll act accordingly by kicking you.

## Looking forward to seeing you there!
