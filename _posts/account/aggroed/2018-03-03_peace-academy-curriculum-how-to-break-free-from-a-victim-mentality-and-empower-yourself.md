# Peace Academy Curriculum // How to Break Free From a Victim Mentality and Empower Yourself




<center> ![](https://i.imgur.com/V8AKBn8.jpg) </center>


A victim mentality results from a feeling of helplessness and lack of control.  It is also tied to low self-esteem in a cyclical manner.

## Self-awareness

In order to break free of this mentality, one needs a healthy amount of self-awareness.

One of the reasons that a victim mentality is so prevalent to some degree is that it can actually *feel* good.

Recognizing the short-time, positive feelings one gets from a victim mentality is the first step in breaking the cycle.

* Self-pity is a form of self-soothing which may initially feel good as you feel justified in your anger while blaming others.

* Avoiding responsibility for life choices and decisions can be extremely difficult.  It is much easier to avoid responsibility and blame others. One can also avoid potential failure by  remaining inactive.

* One can invite others to their pity party and receive loving and caring attention.



But, while the initial results of a victim mentality may feel good, this mentality will ultimately leave you stuck in a helpless state of inaction.

## Take responsibility

* Stop blaming others.  When you find that you are blaming someone for something that is going on in your own life, take a step back and reflect.
Is it really their fault?  
Are you relying too heavily on others instead of relying on yourself?
Are you looking to others to create happiness within you instead of creating happiness within yourself?
Who is actually responsible for your level of happiness in this world?

* Understand that your choices and decisions lead to the results in your life. Recognize your own choices and decisions...or your lack of decisions.
If you are unhappy with your life, ask yourself what ***you*** can do to change it.

## Let it Go

* Stop hanging on to the past in anger.  Forgiveness is not about the other person. **It is the way for you to *heal*.**
Holding on to past anger only weighs you down and has negative effects on you emotionally and physically.  The only way to break free is to forgive and let that shit go.
You will not only *feel* lighter, but it will empower you as well as you take control of your life and your emotional well-being.
