This is the daily AgX chart for today 2018-02-09.<br/>Today's AgX factor is 0.96 for a STEEM/SBD ratio of 1.2.<h3>What is AgX?</h3><br/><br/>The Mayer's multiple (200 days moving average of the BTC/USD price) is known to be a good indicator of the BTC price evolution.
AgX aims to be a similar indicator regarding the STEEM/SBD ratio, in order for users to find the right moment to exchange their SBD for STEEM at the best possible rate.

## The ratio of Steem to SBD seems to be rising <h2>

I made this thing to start figuring out when is a good time to trade Steem for SBD and vice versa.  As long as the values are allowed to float then it's important to know when a trade would make sense given price history.  There would appear to be room for this ratio to continue to go up.
