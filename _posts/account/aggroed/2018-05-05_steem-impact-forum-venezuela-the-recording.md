I think we had a pretty successful meeting today. I'm proud to have hosted a small digital forum with a few members of the Venezuelan community as well as @pgarcgo of the Cervantes Spanish community.  The topics ranged a few places.  There were some touching stories of poverty in the streets.  I'm stuck with the image of a few children eating worms out of a can to find enough food.  There are stories of financial hardship in that the minimum wage in the country isn't enough to buy groceries.  There are clearly some deep rooted economic conditions that are shaping the lives of the every day people.

I was a little surprised to hear about some in the community are aok living happy lives with more than enough to meet their needs.  The narrative of haves and have nots ins't really coming through the American media.

I'm wondering how do we help so we're investigating using a team of Venezuelan programmers to put together a Steem centric job board.  We were able to raise a few thousand Sp in delegations for Cervantes while on air.  I passed Cervantes a witness vote to help them along and build up the Spanish speaking community on Steem.

## Fiddling

During the broadcast I was fiddling with a bunch of twenty dollar bills I recently took out to pay our baby sitter over the next week or two.  I was figiting with them thinking about the fact that one of those $20 bills is the same amount of money that an engineer makes in Venezuela in a whole month.  That's staggering to me.

That's part of why I want to see the walls of commerce come down.  It's somewhat exploitive to start to use Venezuelans to build a platform for job seeking, but once it's up we should see a better system to connect job seekers with employers or more like gig posters with gig fulfillers.  I imagine as the barrier drops we'll see more and more people getting hired and as the supply of labor diminishes we should see prices (wages) rise.

It's also staggering to think that a single upvote of mine of which I can drop ten per day is the equivalent ot a monthly salary for many Venezuelans.  It puts that into a better perspective... that said I have 16k active SP and my voting strength is 70% that means if you own 11k Steem and solely vote for Venezuelans and similarly economically disadvantaged people that you could support 300 people a month with a vote that covers the same as their wages for a month.

## Muchas Gracias

Anyway, great thanks to those that were on the panel, joined us live during the show, and shared their experiences and their thoughts with us.
