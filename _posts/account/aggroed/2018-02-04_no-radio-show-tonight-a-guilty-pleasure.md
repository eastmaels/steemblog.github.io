There's hardly a reason for me to cancel my show.  I basically only have one period of the year I consider truly sacred and that's New Year's where my family has been hosting the same party for friends and family for almost 30 years.  I'm 38.  So, that is pretty critical.  

## Professional Sports as entertainment <h2>

I als normally don't give a shit about sports.  I tend to agree with the sentiment that they provide a distraction for the masses to keep viewers eyes on stars, plays, drama, and a game rather than pay attention to finance, federal reserve, violence overseas, and a million criminal activities by the people in charge of this planet.

## The Federal Reserve <h2>

These guys print money out of thin air by using your promises to pay them back as collateral for creating the money.  It's your promise to pay it back that literally gives them the ability to print it.  They have been abusing that system that's already abusive.  It was sold as a way to reduce poverty all over the world, but is literally the sole driver of it now.  When they create the money they slap an interest payment on it.  What this means is that no matter how much people on this planet work or do there will never be enough money to repay what was created.  This ensures debt... forever.

I'm not against loans.  Lending money at interest is a healthy activity.  But creating money as unpayable debt is a system that's sucking wealth from the poor, stealing resources internationally, and creating an international economic distopia.

## But I already know that and fight it on a daily basis <h2>

So, I'm giving myself a 1 time pass.  My friends are gathering in New England to watch some sports tonight.  Apparently there's a quarterback that's pretty good and he's leading a football team this evening.  Have you heard of this guy?  Tom Brady?  Apparently he's got some talent, and allegedly most of the country hates him.  I guess he's considered a celebrity in New England though.  Time to spend a few hours in the terrestrial world with people I've known for 20-30 years.

## Go Pats! <h2>
