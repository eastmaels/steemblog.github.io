I'm going to start experimenting with upvoting my posts (not comments) with a bid bot at the 5-6 day mark.  I'm doing this for a variety of reasons.

1.  I'm not a shitposter (no matter how many times @acidyo says I am)
2.  I want to reward investors for buying and holding onto Steem
3.  I want to support my curators by waiting until all those interested parties have been gathered and then use the bid bot to curate them back ( I can't right meow 'cause I delegate muh Steem power)
4.  I want to make it harder for shit posters to earn using bid bots by providing competition for purchased votes
5.  I like steem and want moar


## What am I going to do with the increase in SP? <h2>

I'm going to do what I always do.  Delegate it to a variety of minnows, minnow related projects, and Minnow Support Project related things.

## What am I going to do with the increase in sbd? <h2>

idk.  Probably play around with investing to see where I can make more money to own more steem.  I might just convert to steem power and delegate again.  I'm not sure yet.  Depends on how much it is or if I actually make any money doing this.

## How long am I going to do this?"  <h2>

For starters I'm going to shoot for 1 week.  I'll look at the results and see what the people think.

## "Aggroed, your shit posts are way over valued!" <h2>

Well, you're always welcome to flag me if you think rewards are too high, but just be careful because the unintended consequences on this platform are for real.  I aim to at least not overshoot the $1/view thresh hold.

## "Aggroed, if you upvote yourself you're a terrible douche and need to die!" <h2>

The latter might be true without the former, but I happen to think that if we have linear rewards and bid bots are a thing I'm gonna step into the fray and use them on my posts to show what that might look like if a halfway decent steem centric blogger starts upvoting muhself and muh curators. I'm doing this at the end of a post payout cycle where a ton of rewards are shared.  It's an experiment.  Let's see how she goes.

## "Aggroed, you're raping the pool." <h2>

Well, tough to say, bidbots represent about 5-6 million SP.  That's somewhere around 2% of the total pool.  If you think that 2% of the pool going back to relatively passive investors is rewardpoolrape then I suppose we'll see some epic flagging here ("because that will bring new users here for sure" he says sarcastically).  I suppose there's more stuck into @minnowbooster and the folks they work with, but we're still talking about single digit percents.

## "Aggroed, everything about linear rewards is horrible, how can you support any of this? <h2>

The better solution is to fix distribution and then go back to quadratic or exponential rewards when they can function better.  Right now more than 93% of the steem is in the hands of 1% of the accounts (excluding @steemit)  What we really ought to do is make platform inflation a witness variable and then I'd advocate we keep it at 10% for a while assuming we're growing.  Stake weighted inflation is bad because it'll eff over distribution even more, but platform inflation through content creation and curation helps this place grow and spread the wealth beyond the top 1%.

Until then, we're in linear rewards, and instead of complaining about it I'd rather just do the best with the system I have and support my posts and my curators as a start and then look into ways to automate some select vote bot usage for minnows in the pond on the platform.

## Measuring success <h2>

1.  Witness vote changes
2.  Voting on my post changes
3.  Comments on muh post
4.  Interactions on muh posts and in Discord
(5.  Amount of shit I take from MSP Canadian Gingers bad dooting all over muh nuggets)

## It's one week.  Let's see what it looks like.  Cause if we don't start using them right the shit posters win. <h2>
