This is just a reminder post.  The top 30 witnesses, steemit devs, community leaders, and the community itself are all welcome to come talk through HF20 changes, frustrations, hopes and needs tomorrow at 11am NYC time (1500 UTC) in minnowpond.org.  Anyone who hasn't been banned is welcome to attend and speak.  If you'd like to speak please show up early to make sure your mic is sound checked.

The forum will have some basic rules to help things move along in an organized way.

If you'd like to ask a question put in a 2.
If you'd like to answer a question put in a 1.

If you're there acting like an ass you'll get booted.  You're welcome to share any concern you have.  You aren't welcome to be belligerent.

I know a few top 20 witnesses will be coming.  Should be a good crowd and a good show.

Aggy
