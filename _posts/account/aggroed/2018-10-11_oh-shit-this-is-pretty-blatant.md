So, I like to read Benjamin Fulford.  He states a lot of things.  Some have come true.  Some have not.  This time he's mentioning Qanon, which is an alleged military insider that's attempting to bring down the Deep State.  I had a friend on Discord show me images of how a group tried to persuade him to help run the Qanon Larp.  Does that solidfy 100% that the whole thing is a LARP.  No, but it doesn't help it.

This got to a whole additional level though.  Google Chrome is putting the above warning up while heading to the site.  Mozilla Firefox isn't putting up the same dystopian message.  This is our future of mainstream media.  The powers that be (powers that were) will put up roadblocks to sites that they don't like.  Now it's not for you the reader to decide whether information is good and worth acting upon.  it's now up to your friendly neighboorhood big brother corporation to decide that for you.  

I tend to think this is a conspiracy.  I think the world's most powerful people who can print trillions of dollars at a whim work together with corporations like google, facebook, and twitter to silence critics.  You may not like Alex Jones or Ben Fulford, but you'd have to be the most oblivious statist to believe that they shouldn't have the right to share their views.

This isn't a satire piece.  That's not a futuristic funny image of what Google Chrome will show you in the future.  That's on the site now.  Today.  Welcome to Orwell's future.

Oh, and seriouslly Facebook isn't any different.  https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-10-11/facebook-purges-over-800-accounts-millions-followers-including-conservative-meme

I'm literally here on this platform because these assholes like to silence dissenters.  In a weird way I'm really grateful.  The power of blockchain is really only evident because of how shitty this system is, and the immutable nature of the Steem platform wouldn't be quite as powerful if Facebook and the other major media asshats weren't censoring conservative voices left and right (that last part is a pun).

Anyway, if you happen to know any of the facebook groups that were banned try to steer them here please.  You might not make a free lambo on day one with your intricate posts detailing reptillian scrotums being used to euthanize gay priest babies, but at least you're going to have the ability to have your article immutable on the block.  For me speech>lambo and hopefully for those with counter culture voices they'll continue to take up the charge that "even if I don't agree with what you're saying I'll defend to the death your right to say it."
