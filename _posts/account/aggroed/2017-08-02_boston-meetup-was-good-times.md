So, the meetup was a success!  We'll meet again in about a month and a half.  With a few more people in the loop we'll look to grow it.  Next time I think we'll go for a local bar/restaurant and pour post rewards into free food and beer rather than post promotion.  We'll keep growing!

It was pretty nice though to find some other steemians.  @justtryme90 strikes me as a smart and kind fellow passionate about science.  @r0nd0n didn't disappoint with a passion for liberty and free speech.  @orangeshasta clearly likes the two things on their blog weed and cryptotrading.  Orange has a science background and showed up just after @justtryme90 so we had 3 nerds at the table to start.  Lastly we were blessed to have @errigankerrigan join us as well who I didn't get too much opportunity to talk with.

Anyway, good times were had.  Beers drank, legal recreational substances consumed, conversation held, and new friends made.  I think that's the point.  I'm targeting the weekend of September 16th or 23rd for the next one, and yes there will be a next one. 

In true crypto fashion we decided to take a photo sans faces, but nevertheless we were all smiling!  Good times and a pleasure to meet you all.
