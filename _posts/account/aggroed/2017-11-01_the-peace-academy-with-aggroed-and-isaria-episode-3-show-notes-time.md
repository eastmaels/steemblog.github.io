We had a pretty intense show, but unfortunately we were unable to record it due to some technical difficulties (*Shane’s Fault TM*).

We talked about the importance of time in regard to emotions.
Time puts distance between us and our emotional wounds.

I always say that Steemit is the broken hearts club. 
We all have some emotional baggage that we carry around with us. 
Emotional traumas are part of life and we need to find a space for them in order to emotionally integrate that pain and experience so that we can heal.

This is especially hard to do in the beginning when emotions are incredibly raw.
Time allows us to put some distance between the trauma as we try to heal.

It’s also helpful to take a snapshot of our emotional well being so that we can self reflect and find out exactly where we are broken and what we may need to work on.

Time is especially helpful when we have conflicts with others.
When an argument first happens we are usually too emotionally raw to communicate effectively and work toward a resolution.

It’s much easier to see both sides of an issue when we are a bit detached.
Time allows for this detachment so that we can communicate clearly and really hear what the other person is trying to say.

The Universe often sends us challenges in order to teach us what we need to learn and it may keep sending us the same messages over and over until we learn what we need to know.
If you find yourself encountering the same problems time and again then it may be time to step back and evaluate what you need to learn.

We can’t escape ourselves.

We can try to avoid uncomfortable issues by using coping mechanisms, but it’s not healthy or peaceful.

At some point you have to self-reflect in order to change and ultimately live in peace.
