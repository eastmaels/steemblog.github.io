Ok, well we're starting to get a little content in the MSPL library.  It's slow going doing a weekly contest, but as we get more I think it'll take off faster.  You can check out what we have so far here http://www.steemshelves.com/steemit-development/.  Steemshelves is a website by MSP moderator @rhondak that can archive all your posts.  That way when you're running a series on your wall, but you're also active on other topics you can keep all the same topics in one place.

## Winning Posts <h2>

https://steemit.com/programming/@thatdamiguy/html-for-noobs

https://steemit.com/programming/@harshallele/html5-tutorial

Both were pretty excellent and somewhat similar, so rather than choosing one I gave them both 25 SBD, a resteem, and archived them in steemshelves.

## Next Up! <h2>

I want an article that's basically a consumer reports style post on which program people should choose to code in.  Share what's free, what's good for beginners, and what's the best effin' program out there.  Share the pros and cons.  Why do you code with one?  Give some tips on their use.

This one is a little easier so I'm going with 25SBD contest.  If this post gets a lot of love then I'll add more.

Deadline is when the post pays out.  

Be sure to tag the post you make with MSPL.

## Best of Luck!  Keep the Library Growing! <h2>
