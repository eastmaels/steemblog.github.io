It's Saturday!  By now you hopefully know that Saturday morning is the time I do my big panel discussions.  This one is Steem Queens.  I've invited some of the most followed accounts, the highest ranking female witness, and some folks who have started or lead some awesome projects to talk about their work, their success, and help our audience learn how to be successful on the Steem blockchain.
