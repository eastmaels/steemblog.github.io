<p>Harambe&nbsp;is without a doubt a modern day tragedy. &nbsp;A child at a zoo climbs into a gorilla cage in May of 2016. &nbsp;In fact the child climbed a three-foot-tall fence, crawled through four feet of bushes, and then fell fifteen feet into a moat of shallow water. "Where were the parents?" became an oft recited line as many were left to wonder how a small child could go unnoticed as they slowly overcame a veritable obstacle course to personally meet the gorillas. &nbsp;The male silverback gorilla grabs and drags the boy. &nbsp;A guard fearing for the child's life fatally shoots the gorilla. &nbsp;</p>

<p>That tragedy became an overwhelming force through a massive media blitz. &nbsp;Harambe stories could be found on <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-quick-cuts/watch/harambe-the-gorilla-s-endangered-brothers-696259651906">MSNBC</a>, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/05/31/cincinnati-zoo-tragedy-why-do-some-care-more-about-gorilla-than-child.html">Fox News</a>, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/31/opinions/harambe-death-meaning-coppenolle/index.html">CNN</a>, and all the major networks. &nbsp;In large part because of that media blitz the internet reacted with an equal and opposite force. &nbsp;Harambe memes have spread across the internet. &nbsp;It was bad enough that <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/harambe-memes-cincinnati-zoo-gorilla-shot-dead-rip-a7203356.html">the Cincinnati Zoo asked people to stop making Harambe memes</a> as one might expect when dealing with teh internetz that didn't go as expected. &nbsp;The <a href="http://www.wlwt.com/news/zoo-deactivates-twitter-account-after-wave-of-harambe-tweets/41324092">zoo instead shut down it's twitter account</a> after a new flurry of memes were generated.</p>

<p>Now, some of that is normal internet behavior. &nbsp;And frankly the next section here seems on the surface to be pretty typical sophomoric humor from the internet. &nbsp;As the story continues to grow a slogan and a rallying cry develops. &nbsp;The call is "Dicks out for Harambe!" or DO4H or DOFH. &nbsp;The original line came from these twitter user <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1146072-harambe-the-gorilla">here</a>: Who tweeted with an image with him with a gun and the tagline "We coming with them dick's out to avenge Harambe." &nbsp;From there the comedian <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/harambe-the-gorilla">Brandon Wardel</a> posted the first known line of "Dicks out for Harambe"</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Now, I admit. &nbsp;At first glance this whole thing is pretty ridiculous. &nbsp;The explanation of the start though is that the true meaning of "dick" in this case is actually a reference to gun a la the controversial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmAtmec9Jbo">rapper Young Thug</a>. &nbsp;So, when the original poster posing with his gun says "dicks out"he means something akin to "guns blazing." &nbsp;He's talking about violent revenge for Harambe. &nbsp;That said, the majority of people in the world aren't Young Thug fans and the meaning of "dick" was lost on them. &nbsp;The majority of the internet took to believing it meant to pull ones penis out in honor of Harambe.</p>

<p>So, you've gotten here. &nbsp;What does any of this have to do with WWI? &nbsp;For that matter what is Dadaism?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada">Dadaism </a>was a style of performance art primarily practiced during and immediately after WWI. &nbsp;The Avante Guarde artform originated in Europe, but quickly spread to New York. &nbsp;The performance often had absurd and sexually oriented material in it that was extreme for the time. &nbsp;Performers would operate in black box theaters, lock the doors, and masturbate. &nbsp;While the sexual portions of the performance were often the most over-the-top the whole theme of the material was often anti-war and anti-bourgeois. &nbsp;The artists and many of the attendees often shared a profound distaste for the state violence and intellectual conformity that allowed violent transgressions by the state. &nbsp;Traditional art aims to making lasting positive impressions. &nbsp;Dadaism as a true anti-art was designed to offend the senses and break the monotony of thought that permitted the atrocities. &nbsp;Some performances have in and of themselves caused riots!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What I take from all of this is a current reemergence of Dadism in the face of endless war, idiotic news coverage, and a gross distaste for the state of the nation. &nbsp;Iraq and Afghanistan now stand at trillions of dollars of money spent with what appears to the common voter to be no improvement in regional stability. &nbsp;The pentagon can't account for <a href="http://www.newstarget.com/2016-08-18-how-did-the-pentagon-lose-over-6-5-trillion-in-taxpayer-money.html">$6.5T</a> it spent. &nbsp;Thousands of US soldiers, and hundreds of thousands innocent bystanders are dead. &nbsp;America is faced with a vote for two of the most disliked politicians in history. &nbsp;But those aren't the headline stories. &nbsp;Harambe is/was. &nbsp;It's no wonder the internet went crazy for him.</p>
<p>I guess my point is that Harambe's death wasn't in vain. &nbsp;It's highlighting a tradition of lambasting the status quo with the absurd in a desperate attempt to wake the sleeping public that accepts the propaganda from the state that endless wars are necessary and good. &nbsp;And to that I say "Dicks Out!"</p>
