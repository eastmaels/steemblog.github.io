Problem: Steem needs to increase the user base to increase the price.  
Vision: Get maximum benefit from people joining any specific Dapp by allowing their users to very easily work with other Steem Dapps and actually skip a login/registration step.
Mission: Make it as simple as possible for people to safely and conveniently use Steem.
Plan: Make an extension, similar to MetaMask, that allows a user to keep keys stored in an encrypted way within the browser, minimize sharing of keys, help websites integrate it.  

Ok, so, I don't really tell people to do stuff.  It's not very liberty minded.  But... I need you to do this.  Please go get this, use it, and ask your favorite apps/dapps to integrate it.  Tell your friends to do it.  It makes Steeming easier and safer for you.  You can thank me later.

If you're a regular crypto user and browse with Chrome then do this.

Open Chrome
Click this link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/steem-keychain/lkcjlnjfpbikmcmbachjpdbijejflpcm
click install
Shows up as a little keychain icon in the top right. Click the icon to use it.
It will ask for master password to get your other keys but doesn't store the master password.

If you're a developer: It's gone pretty smoothly to get it integrated into a handful of Dapps/Apps already.  You can contact Yabapmatt for some help and instructions.  We'll be at Steemfest.  So that could be a great time to work these details out.

This is good for the ecosystem, free to use, open sourced, home schooled, vegan, fair trade, no millennials were hurt while making it, cage free, and gender neutral.  

Yes, we're working on getting it into other browsers.  Since @stoodkev is the lead dev feel free to message him about how much you'd like it to work in other browsers as well.

This is part of the overall Witness project:  Spread the values of peace, abundance, and liberty, grow the steem ecosystem, and train and retain new members on the platform.  This project is brought to you by @yabapmatt, @stoodkev and @aggroed.

What's it do?  It let's you sign transfers very easily.
