So, Brian Turner, a vegan weight lifting post-acne Youtube jock has also agreed to come on air this evening on the Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  Seems like an excellent gentleman and he's been on the Steem network for less than 1 week.  He's sharing with his audience that they should join the Steem blockchain and we're happy to have folks come on board.  Brian's YouTube page has 200k subscribers.

Brian will be joining at 9pm EST (0200 UTC)

You can find his profile at @brianturner

I'm hosting these three big interviews, and in between we'll have a little music, interviews from the Minnow Support Group, and we'll have Dice and Delegation!

Parts of the show will still be Town Hall Format and the general public will be welcome on air.  Otherwise it's the YouTube show on Sunday!
