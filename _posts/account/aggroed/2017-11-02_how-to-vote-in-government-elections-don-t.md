My main argument is pretty simple.  The world is run by immoral banksters who use fraud enriched Democracy as a mask of approval for heinously violent crimes with manufactured and programmed consent of citizens.  The result is constant war, constant poverty, and a deep state surveillance state.  This government is violent, criminal, unlawful, and weaponizes your consent.  No matter who you vote for more government, more violence, more poverty, and less freedom wins.

## Changing this system is challenging <h2>

You can go out into the street and protest it, but you'll probably just get arrested.  It's hard to fight economically.  Every time you spend a US dollar you are giving it strength.  Your participation is allowing dollars to have value because you are using it and accepting it as a vessel of value.  It's hard to stop accepting it because your mortgage and food is likely only payable in fiat.  You can try to use crypto to avoid the government power of money, but with big banks (which are basically indistinguishable from government) investing in crypto or with bitcoin working with governments to be acceptable as legal tender it's practically impossible to escape.  

## Stop Consenting <h2>

So, what's the answer?  4 words "I do not consent."

Withdraw your consent from this system in every meaningful way that you can.  Stop using their fiat notes to transact whenever possible.  Stop using their services whenever possible.  Stop relying on them.  This can take a million different pathways because their reach is huge, but cut yourself off from their control grid.  Don't watch their fake propaganda on mainstream television, don't eat their gmos, don't take their medicines guaranteed to make other symptoms worse, don't participate with them.  Don't use their social media and their personal tracking systems.

## Scoreboard <h2>

Look at the scoreboard.   Less than a dozen people have as much wealth as over 3 billion.  Those people aren't 10^9 more valuable as a human than the rest of us.  They created a rigged game and have been using it to enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else.  This system is a massive wealth transfer scheme designed to funnel wealth from the poor to the rich.

So stop voting for it.

Your voting habits literally empower them.  It doesn't matter which fake team wins.  You've empowered them because you accepted the winner and the loser in the rigged match.  You have given your consent in a system where it doesn't matter who wins because your interests will likely lose either way.  So, stop consenting and stop supporting it.

## Last Rant <h2>

You are taught to vote between two parties.  Dems and Reps.  We've been doing this for a hundred years, but it keeps getting worse.  The government has more control every year, and we grow more and more impoverished.  The challenge is to recognize that the liberal vs conservative frame of reference is always structured in a way such that statism or the ultimate power of the state remains the answer.  If I could tweak your brain I'd get you to stop thinking so much in terms of liberal vs conservative and spend more time focused on state control vs individual liberty.  

Your personal freedom matters.  Your ability to choose what currency you want matters.  Your ability to voluntarily choose to support a government type of organization matters.  These really simple things are thrust upon us from birth.  Death and taxes are the only two certain things... but why?  Stand here and promise to obey this flag and everything it represents... but why?  We're literally taught to buy into this structure whole heartedly from day one.  You grow up in school being taught to obey the state central authority.  **My hope is that if you haven't already started that you begin to deconstruct the system around you and realize that it's a rigged game.**

Stop playing.  Do something different.  Don't consent.  Don't vote.
