Hey all.  I think it's pretty hard to get started on the platform.  We attract a lot of people from a very general audience who have used social media before, but really don't know anything about crypto.  They may have written short posts, but they probably aren't used to blogging.  The learning curve on Steem is pretty steep, and while you're learning it's hard to earn anything.

## @lovejuice <h2>

I created @lovejuice a long time ago to start flagging self voting mega whale posts and comments that create absolutely zero value for the platform (looking at you @transisto and @grumpycat).  My plan was to leave a friendly message of lovejuice is better shared between two or more people.  Turns out starting a flag war with whales when you delegate all your SP away is a pretty dumb idea.  So, I re-purposed this account as a bid bot.  If you send 0.1 SBD in a transfer with a Steemit.com post URL then you'll buy a vote from it.

## Steembottracker.com <h2>

Before randomly sending money I strongly suggest you head over to steembottracker.com to see the bid bots vote windows.  It tracks what your current ROI would be.  Many of the bots still have room in the ROI so if you're going to bid you may actually make money while advertising your post, but only if you know where they stand.  Steembottracker.com is a website that I co-own with @yabapmatt.  It's a great way to ensure you're maximizing what you can out of the votes you do purchase.

Some trends I've noticed buying votes for a few months.  The best consistant ROI is on the midsized bots.  Very small bots run the risk of someone tossing in 2sbd because it's not a lot of money to them, but may overload the bot.  Very large bots may have 30SBD still left as a potential bid that's profitable.  That's too much money for many people to leave on the table so the large bots often get completely filled.  There's a sweet spot around where the bidbot is worth a 15sbd vote.  The mega buyers mostly skip these.  The fools don't often waste enough bids to kill the window.  And there's a decent chance that at the last minute when there's only 1-2sbd left on the unfilled portion of the bid that someone isn't going to rush in to claim it.

That's advice for maximizing cash for smaller accounts through bidbots while purchasing advertising that can help grow your account.  On the other hand is if you want to purchase large bids (50sbd or more).  I tend to think it's best to catch the bot much earlier.  Place these bids early to make sure there's still room in the bot to get your vote in.  You also dont' want to try to come in late with a mega bid.  You'll likely not make much money and may screw over the bid window for everyone else... that's your right, but most will think you're an asshat for doing it.

## Ok, that aside, I'm paying for content for @lovejuice<h2>

Want 20 USD worth of crypto?  Then write me an article.  It can be about anything.  It can be a story, a poem, a research paper, a piece of art, a song, a performance.  As long as it's yours and original we're interested in it.  When the payout window happens we'll get you paid.  What if you're already a whale or dolphin?  This probably isn't worth it.  $20 in crypto land isn't really all that much money, but if you're just starting or a single mom working from home, or in a country with a depressed economy this could be huge sums of money.  

So, here's your chance.  If you'd like to make some money and get posted on @lovejuice then hop into the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Discord Server](minnowpond.org) and find @isaria.  Put together a new post using the tool hackmd.io and send her a link that has the post contents ready for press.  Don't send her a link to resteem... that's not what we're talking about.  You give us the words for a new post that hasn't been posted, we post it instead of you, and then you get paid.  You're ghost writing for @lovejuice.

When that's done I'll spend some money bid botting these posts to help pay for the service we're providing and get your post some extra attention.  I send @isaria money for @lovejuice management every Sunday and she sends out da money to all the authors.

We do have some standards... nothing that requires a NSFW tag is going to be accepted.  Nothing intentionally harming another person or group is going to be tolerated either.  Other than that you're welcome to write whatever... If we choose not to post it then it's still your content and you can post it on your wall no problem.

## Benefits of this? <h2>

If you're currently making less than $20 a post then this will help you.  If you don't have many followers than writing something for @lovejuice which has 2,500 followers may get you some extra exposure.  If we really like it or love it then you may catch some extra resteems.
