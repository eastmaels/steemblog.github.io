<p>@matrixdweller brought it to my attention that bots run around liking things. &nbsp;Here I'm trying to see if I can snag some bots without much of a story and simply just using a hot girl pic and some keywords below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;crypto-news , steemit, girls, bitcoin, steem, banking, facebook, twitter , life , (oc) , original content, whale-bot , bots , minnows unite , marijuana, how to , second amendment , guns , money, investment , finance, news , ethereum, scam, ponzi , travel blog , vlog , famous, kanye , trump , barack , bernie , clinton, freedom, anarchy , anarcho-captalist , captalist , truth , meditation, omg , new , exciting , fun , happy, follow for follow, hillarysdeath, hillarysbodydouble, hillaryshealth, iran, jobs, career, allepo, relationship, story, fiction, photography, curie, food, beyondbitcoin, poetry, smoothie, health, psychology, anarchy, steemfest, marajuana, introducemyself, film, movie, money, blog, nature, religion, steemleak, education, vaccines, love, technology.</p>
<p>If you're a human upvoting this experiment please just write a single comment so I know you're not a bot. &nbsp;Let's see what happens.</p>
<p>Here's a hot guy pic so that people don't think I'm sexist. &nbsp;I will objectify everyone :)</p>
