I invited my Steem Monsters business partner and the lead game developer @yabapmatt onto my Minnow Mayor Town Hall show.  We turned it into the Monster Mayor Town Hall and ended up diving into lots of stats and how gameplay works.  We show off the site that's going live sometime this week, and talk about how fighting works in some pretty serious detail for those that are curious.

Here's the video

## Steem Exchanger

There's a section of the show that was cut off at the very beginning.  I literally just forgot to hit record.  It involved the folks from Steem Exchanger.  Their website is https://mysteemx.com/.  It's a pretty site and the goal is to switch from crypto-->fiat easily using Steem.  I still have some concerns over the legality of what they are doing as it pertains to the the US.  So, I have some due diligence to do before I can fully promote this thing, but in theory having an application go from fiat to crypto and back that's built around steem is great.  Just be careful as I'm not directly linked to this project.

I cut off about 2-5 min of the start of the conversation with Yaba.  Sorry guys!  You'll get it if you ever run a live radio program.
