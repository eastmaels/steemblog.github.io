Hey all, this last Saturday I was able to host the Sounds of Steem Volume 2.  It was a really fantastic show.  We had 3 hours of live conversations and live performance.  I love talking to the artists and getting a feel of the emotion and energy they put into their work.  I like to hear about what inspires them.  Mostly I love to hear their voices!!!!

This show didn't let us down!

## Hosts <h2>

The show was put on the by lovely, talented, and enthusiastic duo of @kyrstle and @isaria!  I'm grateful for how they found the musicians and use their experience in the Steem ecosystem to pull some extremely talented folks from the community.

## Recording breakdown <h2>

I'll pay 10 sbd to whoever leaves the first comment breaking down who performed when.

## Real Music <h2>

I'm burying the lead a little, but I continue to be refreshed and excited by this music.  Radio music feels so bland.  It's one dumb lovestory or someone's desire for sex over and over, but there isn't substance.  These songs have so much soul to them, and the artists clearly deliver passion.  I'm grateful to listen and enjoy listening to the tracks.
