I like MaM.  I feel like it has a shot to be one of the best brands of the Minnow Support Project.  I've considered a number of people for the nomination.  @clayboyn is hilarious and keep me laughing all day.  @torico is chilllin' as a bad puppy for hours with the MSP crew.  @choogirl is a contest winning rockstar.  @creativesoul is a talented writer and very tender heart.  There's a boatload of Fictioners worth heaping praise on.

This week I want to acknowledge quite possibly the sweetest person on the platform.  I feel good whenever she's in our Discord.  You know some flower and heart emojis are comin' your way.  I know that seems simple, but it's just the every day kindness towards people that makes me think she's one of the brightest lights we have in here.  She strikes me as patient, kind, and caring.  Who wouldn't want more people like that around.

I'm talking about @wandrnrose7.  She's great and I look forward to seeing her when I get to.  So, out of many wonderful folks to choose from this week I nominate her.
