## It's kinda like an open to the public work meeting

I have a few things i need to get done.

I have to build a setting for the game.  I need some cities.  Cultures.  Religions.  Currencies.  Attitudes. and just flavor so that authors who work on the cards 

I also need a style guide.  I spent a lot of time in college in playwriting and screenwriting courses.  I also did a lot of performance art.  There's a standard mono-myth out there.  We have to follow that format for the monsters.  We have to figure out ways to make that mono-myth work for us.

## Card stat previews

I want to catch the audience up on what we're currently thinking.

I want a different playstyle for the various card colors.  Then I want to start working on specs for them.

So, what I'm going to do is ask people to come talk to me about various card styles and how each different set of cards could work.  

High level I'm thinking white focuses on defense and protection. 
Black is a zerg.
Green is a heal deck 
Red is DPS
blue is ?
Dragons do ?

## Game basics

Attack- how much damage a monster can do
Magic attack- damage a monster will do automatically 
Defense- amoutn of damage absorbed
health- amount of damage that can be taken before defeat
speed- who goes first likelihood to hit

there are abilities

We're going to work through how some of the stats can be play balanced, and put along side of mana costs.  If you're looking for a leg up on understanding how the game will work you won't want ot miss this.

## Depending on how that goes we're gonna dive back into standard Minnow Mayor

## Logistics

Show starts in 40 min on the MSP-Waves
