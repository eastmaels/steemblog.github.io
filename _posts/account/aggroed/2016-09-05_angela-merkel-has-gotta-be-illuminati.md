<p>You see that picture. &nbsp;That's a picture from a <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-09-04/caption-contest-whatcha-talkin-bout-putin">Zerohedge </a>article. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not here to talk about Zerohedge. &nbsp;I'm here to talk about Merkel.</p>
<p>You see those hands? &nbsp;She makes that same damn Illuminati triangle every single picture she's in. &nbsp;Drives me nuts. &nbsp;Yes, I get &nbsp;it. &nbsp;You're in power over all the other G20 members.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>I just need more people to see it and to know that she's creepy. &nbsp;No, she doesn't just stand that way. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Notice anything. &nbsp;See those world leaders all waving. &nbsp;There she is all giving the pyramid symbol. &nbsp;Shit's creepy. &nbsp;that's my main point.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-09-04/merkels-cdu-stunned-election-defeat-anti-immigrant-party-her-home-state">Zerohedge </a>also thinks she may have just lost her election. &nbsp;Since most of these are rigged it's a little unfathonable to me. &nbsp;That said. &nbsp;Here's hoping.</p>
