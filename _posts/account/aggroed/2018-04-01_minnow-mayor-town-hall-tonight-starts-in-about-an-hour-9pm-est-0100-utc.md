Hey all, looking for feedback on this logo that @hardikv made.  Goes along pretty well with the video intro to the show that he put together.

## What is the Minnow Mayor Town Hall?

I run a radio show on msp-waves.  It's housed in the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Discord Channel](minnowpond.org).  It's a way to allow members of the 16,000 Steemian Discord community to come on air and talk about whatever they would like.  Only real rule is don't purposefully be a dick to me, other people on the platform, or one another.  I guess also don't post random links during muh show (on topic ones are welcome).

## What can you do?

Literally, anyone on the platform who isn't currently banned from PALnet is welcome to attend.  You can promote yourself, say hi, introduce a project, read something, perform something.  I don't care.  It's all welcome.  It's kinda my version of the Steem Muppet Show.  Everything goes (as long as you're within community standards).

## How to join?

Just hop into Discord and on the left side fo the screen you'll double click on the radio room and be able to listen in.

If you click on the audience channel you'll be able to interact by text.

If you hop in the waiting room I'll bring you on air.  While waiting to come on air it's helpful to listen to the show via mspwaves.com/listen (instead of through Discord).

## Special Guests?

Don't have any planned tonight.  So it's open to whomever.  Hopefully some of the musicians will show up and share their talents with us.

## Delegation

I don't really do this anymore.  Folks that think they participate in a lot of MSP activities and aren't currently on msp-active are welcome to ask me in a 1-3 sentence pitch why they should be on there and I'm generally fairly generous with adding folks that are active.

## Dice Bitches

We'll play dice.  25 SBD.  

I roll
You roll
If you tie or beat me go onto the next round
If you don't tie or beat me STOP ROLLING

to roll repeat my dice command `t!dice 10d10`
it will go down each round ie `t!dice 9d9`

The game is rigged.  If I win once we'll replay.  If I win twice I'll just do a roll off.
