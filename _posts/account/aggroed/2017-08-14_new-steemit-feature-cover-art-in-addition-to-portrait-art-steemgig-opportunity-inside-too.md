Thanks to my buddy and 500SP MSP delegator @buzzbeergeek for sharing this latest neato thing for the steemit.com website.  You can can have two images as part of your user profile.  One is your standard avatar pic.  The other is a much larger cover art piece.

You can see an example of this here from his page-

I think it looks pretty nice!

## Steemgig <h2>

I'm now in the market for some sweet cover art of the @aggroed wall and a variety of bots you can check out https://minnowsupportproject.org/bots/ to see just how many bot cover art images we're gonna need.  If you're an artist looking for some SBD leave your name in the comment section or ideally you can contact me in the Minnow Support Discord room.

## Here's where the link to the image goes in your settings <h2>
