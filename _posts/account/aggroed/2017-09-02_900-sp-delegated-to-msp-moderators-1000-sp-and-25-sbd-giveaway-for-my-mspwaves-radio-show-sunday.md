I told @crimsonclad that I would delegate 500 SP to contestants on her show as a way to grow the MSPWaves audience.  She has had more peeps on her show than mine and I think it's good for the station to have some distributed prizes for listeners.  She said "I have a packed show, so just give it to the mods."  So, thats what I have done.  I've gone through and added a 100SP delegation to each of the mods or to a bot of their choice.

## My contest for my show!

I'm planning on giving 1000SP delegation on muh show.  It airs Sunday night from 9-11pm EST.  It's right after @swelker101 and @isaria go on.  I'm travelling and trying to get my mac laptop setup.  If I can get muh tech working then I'll try to have @stellabelle on the show and hang out with her and hear about her recent Steemfest Trip she put together for some minnows!!!


Should be fun!
