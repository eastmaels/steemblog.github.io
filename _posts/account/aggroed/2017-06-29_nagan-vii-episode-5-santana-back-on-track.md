The universe teaches through contrast.  So, I've made a highly bureaucratic government the antagonist and a free loving libertarian voluntaryst community the protagonist.  Let's see what happens to Admiral Santanta.

## Episode 5-  Back on track <h2>

Santana's eyes opened to meet the hot deathly bright lights of an engulfing inferno.  In truth it was just morning after a pity-party rager, but when the sun came into her room and her eyes opened it burned.  

The last few hours haven't been great sleep by any means.  Puking up 2 bottles of gin and and wiping up leftover vomit with tear soaked shirts isn't cool, but you gotta purge.  Those fucking Karts killed Heather.  They've been flying together since they were kids.  Heather used to bully Santana.  She'd knock her icecream off the cone.  She put glitterbugs in her lunches, but by high school they were close friends, and after college they started patrolling together.  15 years flying together.  You face death.  You save lives.  You really get to know someone and their courage.  

It's not vengence.  We have a right to live as we please without some empire staking a claim here.  We have a right to peace, abudance, and liberty.  We have a right to live in our own right in our own way.  That said.  This one's about vengence too.

Nagan VII News Network braodcasted out footage of the Kart ship popping back in after the slider.  Looked pretty different.  Guess it's been out there a while.  teehee.  Looked ragged as shit.  So, it's probably going back for repairs at the military base, which means she has to get her ship and a group of Nagan fuckery experts together.

She got up, washed her face, and quickly changed.  She grabbed her tech tab, turned the display brightness down low, and took a peek.

Her post hit 14 Trillion liberty scripts.  Looks like brother Johal hooked it up along with whizkid.  She made a note to drop thank you notes. 


 Santana checked her messages.  Muxxy and Welk both bit her up.  Looks like two great shipmates to have on board.  She put in a call to MK down at the shipyard.  Yes they have a ship, yes it's expensive, yes it has the latest shield technology, yes it can jam Kart fuckers with some epic Viking Heavy Crypto Metal.  12T scripts?  Sold.  That's a few extra for some extra crew.  

She pulled up fleetlist.net.  Put out a contract for an engineer and a ship weapons expert.  She won't have a lot of time, but it should be enough to get her bird in the air and a little flying under her belt.

Time to call Mystique and see if she's got her bird ready for a fight too.  Fuckery is'a brewin'.


## Episode 4-  Time to rebuild <h2>

Captain Tanic Elotaw of the Dreadnaught class ship Peace Enforcer 782215 was happy-ish.  The quantum node was generated.  The slip occured, and he was back to the rough time, galaxy, and space he desired, but it literally took two years of his life to do.  It turns out that trying rebuild the quantum pulse reactor when it's heavily damaged, 2/3 of the engineering crew is dead, and you're in a jurassic age dimension is harder than it seems.

So, two years have passed for him, but it looks like he landed his ship within a day or so of his fight with Terrorist Santana.  Also, the coordinates weren't perfect.  It would appear it would take him two to three days to get back to the terrorist instigators, but two-three days is enough time for those little hive mind fuckers to get ships and defenses back up.  

Even worse than that is the signal jamming they do.  It's hard to get orders to everyone on the ship to exactly coordinate attacks when you can't relay a simple voice command.  He's even had his speakers start blaring cryrotoproic death metal or sometimes just get screaming vikings in his headset.  

So, Star System 004-221/4 is close by.  There's a military base there.  Time to restock and crush Santana.  It's also time to call his family.  Margaret will be thrilled that's he's been gone for two years and simultaneously hasn't.
