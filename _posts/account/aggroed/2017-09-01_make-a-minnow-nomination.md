If you're living under a rock you may not have heard of the Make a Minnow foundation.  It's a great project brought on by one of the MSP moderators @sammosk (the single most active community member in PALnet) with some extra special help and love by @eturnerx.  Frankly all of teamaustralia might have their hands in this...  

It's a project whereby the MSP community rents delegation and lifts up 1 minnow to a 10k SP Dolphin for 4 weeks.  It's a way for us to shout out to the stars "This Community Stands by the Awesomeness of this Person.  This Community stands in Awe of their great contributions.  This Community offers gratitude for their service."

## My nomination

One of the single most important parts of the Minnow Support Project is MSPWaves.  Not only is it a great mouth piece for us, not only is it a technological excellence, not only is it a great draw for Steemit and Crypto, but honestly... it's just a shit ton of fun.  While there are several people that can be held up as creating this thing from the DJs that run the shows, the guys who manage it (@ma1neevent, @r0nd0n), the guy with the vision to say "hey we should build a radio station," or even some of the audience members like @kubbyelizabeth that make it really fun to participate... the guy that really did and does the lion's share is @sircork.

## So, I've written one love letter let this stand as another

There are a lot of extremely talented, kind, and service oriented people in the MSP community.  There are folks that literally give every waking hour to this place it seems.  If you see a name in blue they don't just think of MSP as a place to chill, but many of us think of it as a digital home.  It's a home because we have friends and family in there that understand our viewpoints, speak kindly to us, support one another on the ups and downs of life, and yes, we help eachother be successful on the block too.

In part because the guy doesn't actually sleep normally and in part because his work is international in scope, and in part because he's quite a talented programmer @sircork has built himself quite the reputation.  While at times that reputation has been a little mixed with sass and spunk of late those days seem long past.  What we have is an incredibly talented and gifted man, who lives in service to delivering the message of thanks and gratitude and doing that primarily through the radio station/mouthpiece that he built from scratch from little more than "hey, let's build a radio station."

## There are many talented and wonderful minnows, but today is @sircork's day to be my nomination for MaM

To the pondies.  I hope you know you're loved.  I'm filled with gratitude that you spend your time in the home I helped build for all of us.  It's literally one of the best communities I've ever found and I'm daily astounded I helped build it.  Your day will come too.  I know you're working hard and spreading the mission of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty in your own way I'll do my best to support you all.  I'll make sure those of you who kick ass on behalf of this place get a turn in the spotlight.  You deserve nothing less for your hard work.

With love and gratitude to the pond, the mods, the witnesses, and today above all- @sircork; who receives my nomination for MaM.
