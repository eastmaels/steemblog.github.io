<p>Boom. &nbsp;I'm cool now. &nbsp;5,000SP. &nbsp;Only took me a four and a half hundred posts and a few mining tips from @cryptos. &nbsp;Nearly 250 followers. &nbsp;Rep is 65. &nbsp;That's gotta be near the top. &nbsp;You gotta understand I did the hard way with posts about DNC pedophilia, memes, and sarcasm. &nbsp;I did this while poking fun at &nbsp;steemit because I love it and want it to be better. &nbsp;I did this without any whales consistently backing me and in fact several seem pretty put off by my content.</p>

<p>Anyway, love to my followers. &nbsp;Champagne for real friends and real pain for sham friends!</p>
