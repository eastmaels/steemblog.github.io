So, the price of BTC took a healthy dip off of highs.  The announcement happened at 17:30 on the chart.  It was well on it's way to going up.  Everyone wanted free bitcoin ~~clowns~~ clones.  So, the price was going up and up and up.  But then SEGWIT2X happened, and everyone realized they weren't going to get any of that sweet sweet ~~clown~~ clone action.  So, they started selling because as they looked around they saw a bunch of alts that are on sale right now as people pulled out of alts and shoved into BTC.

## What happened to steemit? <h2>

It's about a 10cent increase.  So, it's floating around 9-11%.  I've seen it as high as 15%.  In the grand scheme of things we're still pretty small.  Yes, we have around 450k accounts right meow, but that's still a relatively small community.  Wait until about May of next year and we'll be sitting at a million.  Or wait until the close of the next year when we're at 2 million.  We'll spread our elbows out a little more.

## What happened to other alt coins? <h2>

Well, just about everyone is up as BTC goes down.  It doesn't look like people cashing out of crypto so much as it looks like people taking gains on btc.  BTC is probably going to go back up some more.  There's a lot of hype around it hitting nearly 8k.  People are gonna keep investing in it.  So, overall I think we'll grow the crypto space substantially.

The real trick is to grow Steemit so that the btc whales start seeing us as a steal and a better bet than some of the other coins.  To do that we're going to need to focus on growth.  I'll be hosting some live discussions on MSP waves soon to help us work together as a team and brainstorm platform growth.
