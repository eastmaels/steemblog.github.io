Hey all.  I'm really lucky to have been able to have @yabapmatt on the Minnow Mayor Town Hall this past Saturday night.  We spent a bunch of time diving into how Steem Monsters is going to work.  Some of this is a product discussion, some of it is marketing, some of it is community building, and some of it is simply gameplay.  If you're looking for a detailed discussion between the two founders look no further.  This is the deepest recorded discussion about the game that you can find right now.
