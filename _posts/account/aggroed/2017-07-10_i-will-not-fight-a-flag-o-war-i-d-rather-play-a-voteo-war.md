Adapted from Shell Silverstein,"Hug O' War" from Where the Sidewalk Ends: the poems & drawings of Shel Silverstein, published by Harper & Row Junior Books, 10 East 53rd Street, New York, N.Y. 10022. Copyright Â© 1974 by Evil Eye Music, Inc. 

Shel liked poetry, kids, funny art, and dirty jokes.  He also wrote "Boy Named Sue" which Jonny Cash made famous.  I think he would have been a fuckin' superstar on Steemit.

Anyway,  here's my adaptation.  The MSP community was talking about flagging a comment that we didn't like because it was snide to a member trying to do good things.  Rather than flaggin' the rude comment we altered course to upvote more positive comments and knock it down some.  It's a good lesson and I'm glad it went as such.

## Vote O'war <h2>

<center>

I will not start a Flag o' war,

I'd rather play at Vote o' war,

Where everyone upvotes

Instead of flags

Where everyone resteems

And rolls in the rewards,

Where everyone kisses

And everyone grins

And everyone benefits

And everyone wins. </center>
