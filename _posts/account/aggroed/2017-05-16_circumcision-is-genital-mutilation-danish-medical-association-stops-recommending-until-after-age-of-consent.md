Danish medical association stops recommending circumcision for kids under the age of consent.  That's because they recognize it as a type of sexual violence against male children.  Hopefully this kind of progress happens elsewhere too.  The article is right below.  An Adam Ruins Everything episode is linked below too to help show where the practice originated and why it's pretty frickin' stupid that it goes on still.

I think of it as a pretty simple choice.  Don't cut a substantial portion of your child's genitals off.  It's abuse.
