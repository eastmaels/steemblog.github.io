Thank you to all the musicians that performed, my cohosts @isaria, @krystle, and @swelker101.  It was a great showed filled with 3 hours of live music by Steemit musicians.  We even got to hear @krystle make her first live performance in around 10 years!!!!  WHAT WHAT!  So epic.

These shows are a blast to host, and it's wonderful to meet the exceptionally talented musicians that make up the Steem community.  We heard songs in 3 languages, music in 4-5 genres, had some previous guests, and some brand new faces.  it's like a digital coffee house performance delivered straight up just for you.
