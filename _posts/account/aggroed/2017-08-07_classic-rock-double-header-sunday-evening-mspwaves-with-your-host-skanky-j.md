So, the show format tonight is classic rock, and it'll be a double header.  Meaning, we'll play two songs from each classic rock band in a row.  

You can be sure we'll mention Steemit, bidbots, MSP, btc, trading, crypto, and maybe even talk about Ned and flagging in general.  Come check us out.

MSPWAVES you're riding the Steemy Waves with your host Witness 28 turned DJ- SkankyJ.

We're going strong for the next two hours at least so if you're a classic rock fan, a Steemit fan, or an aggroed fan then it's time to hop on MSPWaves!
