OK, opportunity of your life time is right meow.  Giant banks are investing in crypto.  Between Ripple being a blue chip backed program, JPM investing in ZEC and Fidelity popping in on btc- http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-05-23/fidelity-mining-bitcoin-abigail-johnson-says

"she revealed that Fidelity will be taking some conservative steps to expose Fidelity's customers more to the industry, announcing that customers will soon be able to see Coinbase holdings on Fidelity.com. "

BTC, STEEM, and many of these are probably as cheap as they are going to get.  The USD is going to keep getting worse as we print $160M more of it each day.  You don't get that in crypto land.

So, I guess I'm going to take money and invest in these now.  I should done it a year ago when I started, but I wasn't comfortable enough yet.

I am worried it's going to change the landscape a lot though.  I'm not sure I want the banks, which I presume to be an integral part of the suffering on this planet to be printing USD at whim out of thin air and then buying up crypto.  I also worry how they can impact this space with their agendas.
