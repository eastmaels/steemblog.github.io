We'll be playing live Steemian music tonight at 9pm EST.  I'm very excited to present the live performers for this evening!

## Performers

@hardikv
@meno
@josecabrerav
@thebugiq
@katrina-ariel
@isaria

## Show format

After a few 3-4 hour shows we decided to tone this one down a little.  Each performer will have a chance to answer some questions about their song and music and after that we'll listen to them play live for us.

## The music

If you're not used to listening to Steemian music you're missing out.  These lovely and talented people have so much to offer.  Their non-repetitive and beautiful music will take us on an emotional journey.  It's good times and you're crazy to miss it.

## Logistics
Hop into the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel at minnowpond.org or listen live through mspwaves.com/listen.

Show starts at 9pm EST (about 2 hours from now)
