Wow!  What a day.  500 Followers!  That's a big deal!  Let's do the run down on where ol' Aggroed sits on the steemit totem pole.  I'm using steemwhales.com for this.


44steem
6,306 steem power
$575 steem dollars

954 for account value
433 for rep
797 posts put me in place 688 for number of posts
500 followers puts me in 345th place
586 for posting rewards
579 for curation

Meme the News is finally picked up by the curation team so instead of making $0.17 a post it now makes $2.  That's seems like an ok use of my time.  

I'm in the middle of changing jobs.  So, that changes how much I can post.  Right now I'm waiting for things to come through so that gives me some free time while I chillax on my current job front.

I still think the world is run by a unelected deep state that doesn't wish good things upon us.  I also think it's under unprecedented attack.  Hopefully that resolves peacefully and without a global war.  Still holding out judgement on Trump.  Maybe he is draining the swamp, hard to tell cause it's a big swamp and they muddy the waters every time he does something.

I like this place despite the flagging and the wealth distribution.  I'm momentarily bullish, but I think at some point steemit is going to get much more acceptance and I think the price is going to skyrocket.
