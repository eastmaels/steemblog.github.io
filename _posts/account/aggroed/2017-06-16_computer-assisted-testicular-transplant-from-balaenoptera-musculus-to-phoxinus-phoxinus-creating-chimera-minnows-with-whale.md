## Science Officer's log star date 6/16/2017 <h2>

After several nights of attempting the appropriate transfer protocol's we are pleased to announce the first successful testicular transplant from Balaenoptera musculus (blue whale) to a Phoxinus phoxinus (minnow).

Technical assistance was delivered by @ausbitbank following multiple  rounds of computer assisted transfer.  Minor details slowed the transplant process, but late last evening we are happy to report success.

Full effects of the transplant are unknown at this time, but all leading indicators suggest that there are now 110,000 SP sitting in the @minnowsupport account attached to a free to use and public bot available in the PALnet Discord channel- https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw.

Donor patient @benjojo seems to be responding well, but could use some get well soon cards and gratitude for his wonderful (temporary) delegation of said whale balls.  The Minnow Support Project is incredibly grateful for his delegation and we are excited to give Minnows this opportunity to use a communal whale account to speed up tranistion from Minnow to Whale and form a community around it.

@benjojo we are in your debt and hope that you see a full recovery soon.  We also know this is a temporary delegation and will do the best we can to make an impact in the time we have.  Thank you for your generosity.

The Minnow Support Project is a witness project founded by @aggroed, @ausbitbank, @teamsteem.  The goal is to form a community around Minnows to help them progress in their writing quality, their finances, teach access to various tools, and form an international Steemit community.

If you like the approach and think that a creating a giant Discord community and giving minnows public access to a voting bot that can support them is a good thing then please vote for our collective witnesses.

Public details on the Discord channel and the bots inside can be found here-  https://steemit.com/minnowsupportproject/@minnowsupport/updated-governance-organization-ranks-channels-and-plans-for-the-minnow-support-project
