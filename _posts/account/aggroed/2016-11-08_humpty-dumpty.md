<p>Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.</p>

<p>Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.</p>

<p>The recent news from the steemit blog was good, but there isn't enough good news to overcome the massive amount of steem waiting to be sold, which only increases every single day thanks to massive inflation. &nbsp;Just like normal inflation it's not in the best interest of small holders (aka peasant bloggers/minnows). &nbsp;Your stake gets smushed and the price drops. &nbsp;You own less and your reward is less.</p>

<p>The elephant in the room remains wholly inequitable distribution of steem. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Startups take 20% ownership or so. &nbsp;This one is keeping closer to 60% plus more including the founders and employees. &nbsp;I feel like I bought into a ninja mined coin that I didn't realize was ninja mined.</p>
<p>Welcome to Steembabwe where I'm still just a hundredaire (assuming I take the 2 years/ soon to be 3 months to cash that out) and it shrinks a little more every day... like my soul now.</p>
