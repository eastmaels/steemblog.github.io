This week the community was warned about Ben Schwartz (@fatpandadesign / @getslothyy), an online scammer who has stolen thousands of dollars.   
You can read about it in [this post](https://steemit.com/scam/@neoxian/scam-warning-fatpandadesign-getslothyy-ben-schwartz) by @neoxian, as well as in [this post](https://steemit.com/abuse/@therealwolf/warning-ben-schwartz-is-a-scammer-who-owes-me-2600-sbd) by @therealwolf.



Tonight we want to spend some time talking about online scammers and how to recognize and avoid them.


# How to spot an online scammer:

* targets people with large wallets
* targets Empaths and/or vulnerable, sensitive types of people
* may work to gain trust and make connections by giving small gifts or completing small transactions with you
* attempts to gain sympathy with stories of hardships - hospital bills, stolen assets, family emergencies, etc.
* may attempt to lure you into another network or means of communication like personal email or text
* will often exhibit erratic or dramatic behavior and frantic typing patterns
* resorts to using emotional manipulation based on their hardships if they are having a hard time getting your money - trying to make you feel guilty or like a bad person for not helping them
* look out for holes in their stories or contradictions
