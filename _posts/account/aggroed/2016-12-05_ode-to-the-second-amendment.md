<p>Dear Statists. &nbsp;Your diaper pins didn't fix Standing Rock. &nbsp;Your letters to Congress didn't fix Standing Rock. &nbsp;Your facebook messages helped a little, but didn't resolve standing rock. &nbsp;Even the Elders didn't really end the standoff though they motivated people to come. &nbsp;No, this whole stand off ended when 2k armed vets showed up in town. &nbsp;There's a pattern here if you haven't noticed. &nbsp;Gays get bashed. &nbsp;Armed gays don't get bashed. &nbsp;Minorities get bashed. &nbsp;Armed minorities don't get bashed. &nbsp;Natives get bashed. &nbsp;Armed natives don't get bashed. &nbsp;I'm not saying anyone should run around shooting up a place, but having a lot of guns when you're protecting something seems to work really well even against your own corrupt satanic pedophile government.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Oh, bonus knowledge round. &nbsp;You know why the VA sucks? &nbsp;Ever wonder why we don't take care of vets? &nbsp;Ever wonder why so many of the fighting men in uniform end up pan handling in the streets? &nbsp;Go back and read the top section of this and see if you can figure it out.</p>
