Earlier today I had the Witness forum on Msp-Waves.  
Tonight we'll have @clayboyn join us to  continue the discussion regarding Steemit as far as problems, solutions, and what the future may hold.

**_We also want to hear from you!_**

Be sure to join the audience chat during the show and let us know if you want to come on air with us!  
As long as what you have to say is about Peace, Abundance, or Liberty it's fair game!
