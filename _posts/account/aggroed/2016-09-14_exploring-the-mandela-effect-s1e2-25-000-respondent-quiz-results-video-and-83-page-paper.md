<p>Here are a few quizzes on the Mandela Effect and the Toto Effect. The Mandela Effect is when there is a difference between the memories of groups of people and recorded history for simple things like movie quotes and titles of books/movies or spellings of words. The Toto effect is when people remember more tangible things being different like History, Religion, Geography, and physical products very differently than recorded history. You may find that when you can look at a series of examples that the world around you is very different than you remember.&nbsp;</p>
