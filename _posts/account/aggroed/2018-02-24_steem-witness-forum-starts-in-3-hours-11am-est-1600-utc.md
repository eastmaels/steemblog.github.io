Hey all.  Here's your reminder post.  I'll be hosting the Steem Witness Forum today in just a few hours.  One change to announce, @good-karma messaged me and said it's unlikely he'll be able to attend.  Fortunately I received a message from the @curie community witness.  So, we're replacing @good-karma with @curie in the lineup!

## Witnesses <h2>

@timcliff
@curie (@carlgnash)
@aggroed
@furion

## Backup Witnesses <h2>

@cervantes
@exyle

## Steemit Representative <h2>

@andrarchy

## It should be a good discussion <h2>

Here's hoping you'll come join us as we talk about the state of the Steem network and projects that Witnesses are working on, vision for the ecosystem, and changes we think need to be made.

Show starts at 11am (3hrs from now)

You can find us in the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel](minnowpond.org)
We can guide you once you're in there!
