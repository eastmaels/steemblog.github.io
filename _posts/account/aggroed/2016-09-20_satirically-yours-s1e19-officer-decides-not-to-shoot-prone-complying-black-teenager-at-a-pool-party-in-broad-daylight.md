<p>In a stunning turn of events an officer arresting a peaceful swimmer at a pool party in a white neighborhood decided not to shoot her surrounded by her friends in broad daylight. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Officer Smith shared "You know, every instinct in me told me to pull out that gun and shoot her. &nbsp;I am constantly afraid in this job. &nbsp;You never know which person of color is going to be the one to finally shoot back, and on the force we talk a lot about making sure we're the first to fire."</p>
<p>Local Police Chief Aaron White brought him in to be disciplined- "Officer Smith is a good officer, but today he showed some measure of self control. &nbsp;We don't want our men in blue putting themselves in harm's way or in danger, which is exactly why we tell them to shoot any black person acting suspiciously before engaging with them. &nbsp;Officer Smith was reckless arressting her without 15 other cops for backup, and once he had her prone, and controlled he also failed to execute her. &nbsp;We are placing him on paid leave to contemplate his decisions on blue safety concerns."</p>

<p>Members of the community were of mixed opinions. &nbsp;The party was held on Oaksview St and a local neighbor Barbara Flint was concerned.</p>

<p>Flint- "Officers put themselves in so much danger already. &nbsp;I want a safe community and sometimes you just simply have to execute people of color in your neighborhood in order to make that happen."</p>
<p>Other members of the pool gathering were shocked. &nbsp;"We were doing the exact same thing. &nbsp;Actually, to be honest we were drinking and we're only 19. &nbsp;But when the officer came over he went straight for her and left us alone. &nbsp;I mean... I'm glad, because I don't want to be executed myself, but we have to think of children in this community. &nbsp;You can't just have peaceful fun-loving black women swimming in pools in white neighboorhoods. &nbsp;It's too dangerous for everyone. &nbsp;Cops could miss when they fire 30 rounds at her next time. &nbsp;I have two sisters that are young and I'd hate for them to be shot like that.</p>

<p>Still others noted "I wonder when it will stop being illegal to be black in America?"</p>

<p>Officer Smith will contemplate his actions while on paid administrative leave in the Bahamas starting later this week.</p>
