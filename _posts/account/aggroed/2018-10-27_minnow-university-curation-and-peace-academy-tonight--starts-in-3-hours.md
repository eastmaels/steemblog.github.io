As per usual I'll join Shane and Isaria (the two behind the @steemcreative witness) on air tonight at 9pm EST (3 hours from now) to just talk about finding success on the Steem blockchain.  We're always asking for posts to curate and send a little love to.  So, if you'd like to get some rewards going this is the time when we actually ask you to ask us to vote for you.

OK, once the Minnow University Show is done we switch gears and talk through the Peace Academy.  We have a range of topics that include learning to live with ourselves, processes for grief, sometimes we dive into the woo (esoteric topics), and sometimes we dive into some counter mainstream logic evaluation of current events.

Should be fun.

You can join us live at mspwaves.com/listen and in Discord at minnowpond.org
