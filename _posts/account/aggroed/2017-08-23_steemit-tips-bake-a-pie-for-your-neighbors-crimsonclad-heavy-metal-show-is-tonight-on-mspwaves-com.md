Generally in the United States there is a tradition of gifting pies for new neighbors, but the tradition doesn't work the same way everywhere.  In particular in the MidWest it is frequent that the neighbors in the neighborhood will bake you a pie and welcome you to the neighborhood.  In New England the tradition is more likely that you bake a pie and give it to your neighbors.

I'm not entirely sure why there are the differences... I think the midwest may be more hungry for growth and so they welcome people into their community with open arms and try to keep the people that come.  New England is already fairly dense by American standards and so we're kind happy if people just gtfo, but if they come bearing pies maybe we'll love them.

## Which kind of place is Steemit? <h2>

Tough news for newbies... you gotta bake the pie.  You have to bring it to your neighbor, and you have to earn their trust and love.  Steemit wants growth, but Steemians don't really want a bunch of spammy fucks begging for upvotes and follows either.  We want contributors that will make the network better, stronger, more robust, and offer more things to more people.  We don't want a million handouts...  So, if you're going to come here, and you want to get noticed you have to bake a pie.

## But Aggroed, this is a digital space.  I can't bake a pie <h2>

No, you can't, but that doesn't mean you can't approach people with a gift or offering.  So, rather than starting with a "Hey, will you follow me?"  Why don't you start with a "Hey, look what I can do for you?"

## 2 recent examples <h2>

@diego messages me on steemit.chat.  Most of the time when new people message me it's not the message I want.  No I dont' want to follow you.  No I don't need another lion picture article.  No, I don't want to upvote your contest.  No I don't....  blah blah blah.

ok, but this kid comes and says, "Hey, I'm new here, and I make EDM music, I'd like to share it with this community, can you help introduce me to it?"  I don't know how he got my name.  I dont' know how he knows I like EDM, but here we are.  Rather than ignoring him or telling him to get off my lawn I resteemed his intro.  I told him to make me some Dubstep, and offered him an MSP waves radio DJ spot.  We could use someone on the 1s and 2s so to speak.  We'll see where it goes.  But he says he offers EDM pies, and that was close enough for me as a minnow lover.

## Example 2 <h2>

@andren just made me a cover art.  I hadn't had one before.  Now I do.  Now I'm introducing this graphic artist to nearly 5,000 people who will hopefully follow him, possibly ask him for art, and help him build a community.  He offered me a pie.  I resteemed his stuff.  That's how this community can work.  It cost him a bit of time to make me a cover art.  It cost me over a year to build a community that I have, but at this point it's free to talk about him and get him exposure for his work.  

Quid Pro Quo?  Equivalent Exchange?  Pie for Pie?  IDK what you wanna call it.  But that's just good business.  He gets an audience and I get a banner.

## Moral of the story <h2>

If you're the little guy on here, and you want to make a name for yourself or build a community.  Make people pies.

## MSP Waves <h2>

Quick plug for @crimsonclad.  She had the highest attended show last week with her heavy metal business FULL FORCE THURSDAY.  Should be a stellar showing again tonight.  You won't want to miss it.

## Delegation request <h2>

Day one we got around 16-17k in Delegations on @minnowsupport.  We're driving for another 84k or so.  Please consider delegating just a few thousand SP if you have it.  We are basically a volunteer army helping to train and retain minnows on the platform.  If you think that's a service worth having than please delegate to @minnowsupport.
