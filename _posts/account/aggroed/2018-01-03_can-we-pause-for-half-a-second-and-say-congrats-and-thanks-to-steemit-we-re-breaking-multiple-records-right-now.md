Look I know there's a lot of frustration that's been going around towards Steemit.  There haven't been enough changes to the UI fast enough to make everyone happy.  There was a slow period while getting DDOSed.  There have been challenges along the way.  I get all of that.  But we're also kinda kicking ass.

## Blocktivity <h2>

This is a site called blocktivity.info.  I found out about it through @steemitblog.  It's tracking price relative to how much activity is on a platform and also keeping track of how much room is left on the block.  Steem currently holds the record for most transactions on a block.  Not only that, but we're still sitting under 1% utilization.  Steemit has some more changes coming to make it improve, but right now we're the most active and still have room to grow.

Maybe you don't think that's all that cool, but you'd be wrong.  If you want to power an entire internet on a blockchain you need one that can handle an assload of transactions.  I'm looking around and while many of those coins still have room none of them could power it themselves... except Steem.

## How bout price? <h2>

I'm pretty sure we're at all time high levels.  We're doing pretty well right now.  $7 steem.  Maybe it's a pump.  There are some witnesses that are still mad at Steem that think it's just a pump.  I happen to think it's that the market is finally pricing in the things that are coming in 2018: onboarding improvements, communities, and SMTs.  That's gonna be a hell of a year and I think the market is now accounting for it.  

It's possible it's just a pump, but I think the fact that we're raising up faster than some of the other coins is suggesting that we're not just keeping up with BTC, but we're actually gaining on it.  I think it suggests a good future for the coin!

## Minnow Support  ~~is about to~~ hit 7k active Steemians! <h2>

With prices surging we have a pretty massive influx of new people!  MSP is about to hit 7k active members!  that's remarkable.  I fucking run a city!  Who knew, but check out this chart from @penguinpablo-

We have over **300,000** unique accounts using Steemit.com last week.  That's incredible!  Apparently $10SBDs and $7 Steem really keeps folks engaged on the platform!  I'm not positive, but I think that's an all time high too!



## Anyway, there's been a lot of hateraide and I just wanted to toss these guys some love! <h2>

Thanks Steemit.  You guys have put up with some serious shit.  You haven't been perfect, but you're getting us to the crypto promise land.  So, I just wanted to stop and say thanks!
