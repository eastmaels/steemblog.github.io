I've been looking at card prices for Steem Monsters.  I settled in on tracking the beta regular foil summoners as my overall barometer for how card prices are doing.  Maybe I'll expand this some more in a future post, but for now this is the extent of my price research.

## Study

I went to peakmonsters, I selected regular foil, beta, and summoners.  Then I clicked the month charts.  It shows me the 4 week average price, the current price for a single level 1 card, how many were sold, and how many were put on the market.

I then took the difference between the current price and the 4 week average price.  At the very end I averaged all the price changes.

## Results

Nearly all summoners are trading above their 4 week averages.  Selenia is the only one that is showing a price loss relative to the 4 week average.  The other ten cards have gone up in value.  Malric and Kiara show the smallest gain in the 5% range while Xander and Lyanna show the largest gains of 54% and 74%.

On the whole the summoners are trading 25% above their 4 week average price.

## Marketcap

The current Market Cap of all the Steem Monsters cards out there is $1,181,241 as calculated by the Discord bot.  This is off the recent low of around $1.1M, which marks a somewhere in the vicinity of 5-10% gain off the low.  If steem monsters were a coin listed on Coin Market Cap the Market cap would put it as the 710th coin.
