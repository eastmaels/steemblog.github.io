We just pushed a small change on steem-engine.com.  Steem-Engine.com had it so that you could only transact to the 3rd decimal point for steemp.    We now allow up to 8 decimal points when trading on the platform.  You can still only deposit and withdraw up to 3 at a time because that is a steem limit.  However, when trading you can now trade to a smaller decimal point. 

A good use case is DEC that Splinterlands released yesterday.  Before people had to trade it at 0.001 or 0.002 steemp/dec.  Now you can trade with a finer degree of precision.

Enjoy!


ps tell me in Discord if we broke anything doing this :)
