Tell me, has this ever happened to you?  You were searching on the internet and not getting get paid in crypto to search?  That's terrible!  Think of the children!  This is a crisis some thoughtful programmer needs to fix.

@taskmaster4450 wrote an article I saw this morning saying Steem needs a browser.  Here's the article.

## A browser?



I've had the idea in the back of my head for a little bit that what Steem needs is a Search Engine powered by Steem.  My brain child is likely a little easier of a project than a full browser and it works well with some aspects of blockchain.  Take an opensource search engine and slap in some steem-engine tokens as a reward for using it on the Steem platform.

## What's good?

Well, the major media companies modify search results all the time.  I see the view counter changing on my own videos and others frequently.  There's other problems too especially with how they like to silence conservative voices.  They change search results.  Having all of this on a blockchain means that we don't have to trust CIA backed projects to tell us what other people are searching for.

If all the data of what you're searching for is on a blockchain than you can review that data and see what people are actually searching for.  Combine that with a token distribution plan where people who search get tokens for doing it and now you can start to incentivize people to use your search engine.

## What's bad?

When I look up furry hentai lesbian alien porn and it gets logged as an aggroed search that probably feels invasive.  So, this thing would be great for looking up things on the internet excluding sex, which means it's good for like 3% of internet traffic.  Maybe you could get some searches to stay anonymous and the app could search on a users behalf, but then the app awards the token to itself instead of the user.

## Free idea for an inspired coder

The project doesn't seem that daunting to me.

Step 1. Open Source Search Engine
Step 2. Keychain integration
Step 2a. Steem Engine Token creation
Step 3. User searches, app or user posts the search as a custom json
Step 4. App sends them tokens for searching

Phase 2.  Use the token for marketing/ad purchases on the site to give it value

A good dev could probably whip this up in a week or so as a very early alpha.
