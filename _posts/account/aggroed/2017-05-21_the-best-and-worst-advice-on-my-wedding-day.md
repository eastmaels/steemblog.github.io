My wife and I are approaching 15 years of marriage.  I'm in my late 30s we got married in our early 20s.  We live in New England... it's basically unheard of.

Anyway, before I got married a friend of mine who was a few years older than me mentioned the best advice I'd received on the actual wedding.  It wasn't logistical.  It wasn't about the whole thing.  It's also ironic to me because a few years later we helped his wife pack up and leave over his infidelity .  But the advice was really simple and truly beautiful.

## Freeze a moment in time <h2>

All he said was... "It's an amazing and beautiful thing to watch your wife walk down the aisle.  Take special care to remember that moment."  

My wife and I ended up getting married near the ocean by a hill.  My wife actually chose to walk down the hill with all the switch backs.  I got to watch her walk down the aisle at me for literally a minute as she stepped closer.  My memory for things like this isn't amazing, but because of my friend's advice my brain has a stored reel in there with a title of "Best friend, long walk, wedding."  I play it in my head when I do reiki and I'm trying to pump as much love through my heart as possible.

So, to all of you out there soon to be married.  I'd share this simple advice.  Stop your brain.  Roll camera.  And store that long walk down as your heart beats faster!

## And then there's this moment! <h2>

I called my grand parents who lived in Florida and couldn't travel to the wedding.  It was about an hour before the ceremony.  I tell them "Hey, you mean so much to me.  You've met my bride and welcomed her.  I wanted you to be part of this day, so, I love you both and at least you can participate a little this way!"

My Grandfather stopped, paused, and said "I don't think you should get married today.  It's a lot easier to say 'No' now than it is an hour from now."  I think all the blood must have withdrawn from my face.  What a weird time to share that!  It's not like we eloped.  He had a few months to say it... oh well... "Can you put my Grandmother on the phone?"

I heard her sweet voice come on the phone... and then she decided to channel some 1950s book on relationships... "You're a man now.  As the man you have to take control of this relationship.  You're the sole head of house, and for that you have to be strong."  It's like she fast forwarded to now, really bought into Handmaid's tale, and then went back in time to deliver that marriage advice (or more simply, she just listened to the standard advice of the day).

## Marriage is the hardest and most likely best thing you'll do with your life <h2>
I tend to steer people away from marriage at first.  If just that little bit of negativity can steer them away then they probably weren't ready for it.  If they stand firm then I switch to highly supportive.  Marriage is hard.  It's hard work.  In some ways it gets harder as two people living together inevitably hurt one another.  Those things build up if they aren't addressed.  Hopefully, you have good role models to learn good and effective ways of communication.  At least then you have a chance that after you hurt your other that you can mend.
