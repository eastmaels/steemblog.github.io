Holy shit this is a thing of beauty.  We launched tournaments at that low point.  Look at it sky rocket!

We are at $1.12M.  Low was at 0.989M . That's a 13% gain in 2 weeks.  That's looking super healthy.  Steem looks like it's pushed up against some hefty resistance for a little while while the short term moving averages catch up... So, what's that mean?  This could be a good time to take some profit for anyone who took the dive at the bottom and get yourself some Steem Monsters cards.

I highly suspect that the delegation command will be live next week on the real server.  That means you can own cards and then rent them to other players!  I'm personally looking forward to making a few bronze level decks to let people use.  I'll either rent them or find some players who are looking to play for a while and let them play so long as I get half of any tournament purse they earn and the best rewards card they get once every 2 weeks.

I think that's a pretty decent deal.  I think I'll be able to do that with a few diamond decks, maybe a gold foil deck, and certainly I got some sweet summoners that I'll put up on the delegation market so players that are looking to up their game can do so cheaper than ever before.

Anyway, you might not be gamer, but Steem Monsters isn't just a game.  It's a market, and I bet there's plenty of you that love making money in bull markets.  

We'll see if I'm right or wrong, but I think cards are likely to go up in price when players can rent them...

## The vision

When I put together the original mechanics of how I thought Steem Monsters might work I was watching a lot of the recent launch of Spartacus.  This is around 2014.  Spartacus follows the story of a slave who is a gladiator who eventually is able to get a rebellion going and wrek Roman face for a while.  The story follows along how there are some rich overlords that coerce people into fighting for them.  Some end up digging it.  Some end up dying horribly.  Most are doing it without their consent, but it's a cool freaking story filled wtih gore and nudity.

Anyway, as I'm thinking about what the future might hold for Steem Monsters I'm considering the possibility of delegation and guilds.  Part of getting this game to esports level is making sure there can be professional teams.  So, I'm seeing in this vision that players can form their own guild and become Dominus, master of the fighting crew.  They can either own all the cards and delegate them or work with certain players to bring their own decks to the fight.  Players will compete in live or asynchronous arenas where players from the guild are chosen to fight at different level caps are rule sets based on guild level and team needs.

Look, if this thing all works out you'll have teh ability to become Dominus!  You'll be the master of your stable of arena tested warriors clawing your way through competition for glory and riches!  I mean, we'll do this a little more consensually than what they did back then, but I see team owners recruiting players by enticing them with complete gold decks to play for them.  Crypto projects could create professional teams and send them in the arena to win riches and attention.  The stars will stream their matches and thoughts on combat so other players can learn from them.

It'll be blockchain based houses of combat pitted against each other.

Be a Dominus!  Rule the Arena!  *Crush your enemy!  See them driven before you, and hear the lamentation of the women!* 

Do that... or watch everyone else be awesome!
