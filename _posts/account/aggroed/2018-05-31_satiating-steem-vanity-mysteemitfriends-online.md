ok, so I'm like the most competitive person ever.  I can't help it.  I play a game with my 8 year old who can grab the other's nose first.  I try not to let her win even if she cries about it.  I'm a little over competitive.  I try to hide it, and keep it to myself, but right now I have to share this tool that actually tells me what I want to know.  This used to all be on steemwhales.com and I loved that, but since heimi blew up huge with dtube he's had some other shit to do.

## Website

So, today I'm talking about mysteemitfriends.online.  It's a website that tracks cool data.  I came for follower count to know where I'm currently ranked on the chain, but I've found some other good shit too.  Here's what the site homepage looks like.

So, you have the ability to check quite a bit of stats.

## Let's start with contributors

These are the folks that have helped me grow my account through posting.  Looks like I owe @canadian-coconut a slightly used mid sized sedan!

## Next I wanted to know how I stand in power rankings

Looks like @aggroed has the 152nd most Steem Power of anyone on the block.  Looking to break top 100.... thinking Steem Monsters is gonna help me do it.


## Reputation- possibly the most important stat

here you can see Im' rocking my rep of 74.37 putting me 43rd on the whole platform.  Rep has a lot to do with rewards you've earned and who has hit you with them.  The fact that I'm this high on the list usually means I've gotten some sweet sweet voting love, and have escaped getting many flags

## Follower count... my mega vanity

Ok, I have a social mission to spread peace, abundance, and liberty.  That means I have to have followers to receive and spread that mission.  This is the number that means the most to me.  As you can see I'm at 29th highest follower count on the platform, but that's not a real number.  Folks like cryptoriddler have tons of followers they gain through f4f.  I tend to remove those bot like accounts when trying to come up with my actual follower count.  When I've done that I count myself as 13th on the platform for follower count aka message spreading ability.  That's joyful news!  Gotta hit top 10 though.  Ned's only 2k follows ahead.  I bet I can sneak them out... he doesn't post much!  He doesn't have monsters...

## that's my steem help post for the day.  Use this site to know how awesome you are on the platform!
