Ok, well, I've done it.  I've completed the entire deck.  All these gold legendaries were purchased from other players.  A few backroom deals.  A few on the market.  But I got there.

I'm giving myself naming rights for this achievement.  I'm calling it Bring the Light because my NPC in the game will be Aggroedius the Lightbringer.  Now I may have to make him the one of the richest people in the world.

I have faith in a few things.  Crypto and Steem will rebound.  Steem Monsters will continue to be a success.  Steem Monsters will be not only a great game, but a great brand and series of games across a couple different genres.  Gold card values will reflect the fact that Yaba and I will run tournaments and those tournaments will pay out $1000 worth of SBD and Steem.  There will be gold only tournaments.

I feel complete now.
