Check out this zerohedge article about it- https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-12-19/drastic-reversal-us-prepares-full-withdrawal-forces-syria-immediately

I'm excited!  I'm glad to see us getting out of that conflict.  Ok, now there's only 6 more countries we're currently bombing to stop bombing, and then after that only like a hundred more countries to remove our military presence from.  After that we can win people over with good trade and economic unity rather than tanks, guns, sanctions, and threats.
