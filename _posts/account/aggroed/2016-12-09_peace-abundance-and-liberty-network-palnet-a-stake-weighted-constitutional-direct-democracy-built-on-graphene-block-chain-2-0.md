<p><br></p>
<p>Continuing the discussion of creating block chain government and what that might look like. &nbsp;I've started a good conversation with one of the software architects for STEEMIT and we're working on tweeking it to function as a full fledged government. &nbsp;Here's what the first round of tweaks will look like.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A Graphene blockchain based on Steem.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Deliverable: The current Steem source code, with the following functionality added:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>- Half of all newly minted coins go into a `Public Fund`</p>
<p>- A transaction to propose a project paid from the `Public Fund`, which describes the project (limited to one of the following essential service types: commerce, common defense, communication, education, environment, food, health, news, shelter, transportation, water) and price (price is variable but capped at 5% of `Public Fund` balance at time of proposal)</p>
<p>- A transaction to vote for/against a `Public Fund` project, with public comments available</p>
<p>- A transaction to veto a `Public Fund` project (must be signed by an active witness)</p>
<p>- A week after a `Public Fund` project is proposed, if more stake is voting for it than against it *and* the `Public Fund` contains sufficient funds to pay, the project price is paid to the proposer; otherwise the project is discarded</p>
<p>- A `Constitution` file is encoded in the genesis block</p>
<p>- A transaction to propose a replacement `Constitution`</p>
<p>- A transaction to vote for/against the replacement `Constitution`</p>
<p>- 60 days after a replacement `Constitution` is proposed, if 2/3 of voting stake is in favor, and 2/3 of witnesses are in favor, the `Constitution` is replaced</p>
<p>- Support for listing pending `Public Fund` projects</p>
<p>- Support for listing pending replacement `Constitution`s</p>
<p>- CLI wallet support for all of the aforementioned transactions and listings</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&gt; Under consideration: A vesting period for Power stake (analogous to Steem Power) such that, after powering up, it requires 1-2 years for this stake to reach full voting rights. Objective is to prevent whales from buying in and hijacking the voting process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I'd love to get your thoughts. &nbsp;What other basic functions are we missing to get launched. &nbsp;What services would you want an internet based blockchain government to provide? &nbsp;Do you want to help us?</p>
