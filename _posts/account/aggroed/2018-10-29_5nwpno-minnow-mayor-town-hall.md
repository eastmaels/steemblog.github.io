All right muh Fishes!  We're doing another Minnow Mayor Town Hall tonight.  Lots of stuff in the air.  We got curation, attracting businesses, the bear market, posts, projects, apps, dapps, and all kinds of shit going on.  Come on air and talk about it.  If left to my own devices I'm likely to ramble on about Steem Monsters.  Personally, it's pretty awesome watching prices steadily rise during the BEAR market.  I can't wait to see what happens as we grow and we enter a bull run.  

This isn't financial advice, but I would suggest SODL HOUSE AND HODL MONSTERS!

Anyway, I'm going live in 5 minutes.  Hopefully I'll see you there and you guys have some stuff you wanna talk about.

Cheers
