So, as a top 20 witness I make a few hundred steem (as steem power) a day.  All of the people in the top 20 do.  A block is witnessed every three seconds, and in rotation all the top Witnesses will witness a block nearly once a minute.  It will release ~0.2 steem as steem power when we do.  In a day I'll witness ~1400 blocks and that will release under 280 steem power a day.

I've been building up my steempower since I've been here.  I plan to keep doing that.  I have a full time job so I have other avenues of income so I don't have to power down.  So, my plan is to keep building steempower, which not only helps through delegation, but if you didn't know; Witness voting ignores delegation.  So, when I vote for minnow witnesses to help get their campaigns started I'm able to get give them my full vote even though I delegate 95%+ of my steem power most of the time.

So, what do I do with my Steem Power?  I delegate it away.  I use post rewards to pay my server fees and costs.  I use my sp for delegations, and I focus on getting communities started.  A great way to get them going is to use the tools we have in the Minnow Support Project.  @netuoso built msp3k.com and won a MSP Medal of Honor for it.  It's a program that stores private posting keys in a hidden way, which allows many people to have access to upvote and resteem.  So, this week I've gotten a few off the ground and supported others.

## New Communities <h2>
@msp-canada
@msp-turkey

I'm stoked to say both of these groups are off the ground.  Both have 6-10 people curating them.  There's around 1,000 SP on both accounts, which isn't bad for the first week.  It's nice to see how how quickly these things can get started!  I delegated to each as a starting point so its more likely folks will kick in on their own too. I like how when people feel ownership they are more likely to delegate and build together. I think a community account like this can be the centerpiece of steem based communities.

## Helping Existing Communities <h2>

@mrsquiggle
@msp-lovebot

Squiggle is the #teamaustralia community.  They were doing great having a centralized curation by @scooter77.  But he was quick to think it's cool af to make it community based.  We added 6+curators to help find good content and get it exposure and votes.  Hopefully the increased engagement and ownership leads to a strong community account and internal collaboration.

@msp-lovebot is muh personal baby and I created it to support the people that help MSP run.  I like to resteem content that I like. I like to vote people that I like.  In some way after I have picked them or they have picked me I don't really care what they are posting.  I'm going to suppoet it (as long as it's in line with PAL).  So, my big delegation this week was 1,000SP onto msp-lovebot bringing my total delegation there to 9000 SP!  This way I can literally help everyone that's helping MSP.  Currently, it's my favorite community bot to support.

## Technical Highlights <h2>

I've switched to 19.2.  Here's hoping it can actually help Polo suck less.  I'm still at 1 missed block.  I don't have any interest put in place for SBD (0.01%).  I think it'll only help polo and bittrex and the price is actually pretty stable on Bittrex around $1, so I don't think it needs it.

The Minnow Support Project has 4500+ people in Discord, 5,000 followers on Steemit.  70k+ Steem Power on the main account.  Over 500 delegators supplying over 150k SP to all of our projects.  We have 3 Witnesses that have reached teh top 20 after their involvement, and about 12 total who support, manage, delegate, or are just getting started out of "The Pond."

Oh, and in case you missed it we're Steemit Official.  @timcliff put in the accepted pull request that points the New Member Support Group to the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network, which is home to the Minnow Support Project.  So, kudos to us, not bad considering we've only existed as a team for around 4 months.
