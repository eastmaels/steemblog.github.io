So, I was thinking of making a board game.  Maybe it's a novel.  Maybe it's a screen play.  It starts with the best name ever.  Meowcropolis.

Meow for cats.
Opolis which is Latin derivation for city.

So, it's a city of cats, but I'd basically have 3 races in play.  Snakes, cats, and mice.  Ultimate power is the poisonous snakes.  Middle men bad guys and the faces of crime are teh cats.  The little people getting bullied are teh mice.

There are some cat lovers out there that ultimately have to understand that those fuckers are diabolical so being evil city crime bosses makes purrrfect sense.
