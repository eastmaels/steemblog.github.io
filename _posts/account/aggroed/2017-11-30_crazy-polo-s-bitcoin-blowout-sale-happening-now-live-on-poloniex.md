## What amazes me some sarcasm aside <h2>

Why the hell can't Steem ever seem to pick up past $1 these days?
SMTs are gonna be a game changer.
Communities should be pretty spectacular.

The biggest risk I see is that the chain dies from bloat, but the thing I notice is that the bigger we get the more software engineers we have and the more resources we have as a community to fight technical problems.  So, I generally think we'll keep seeing chain needs increase and then find more and more ingenious ways to cope with it as we grow.

So what's holding investors back?

Do you have a lot of crypto or other funds that you're squirrelling away other than Steem?  What are the biggest problems you see here?

In 3 months we should be dropping tokens left and right around here and then support them with community gathering places.  What I am missing?
