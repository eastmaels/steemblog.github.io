I've had the opportunity to do a lot of things on this platform.  I've founded the largest off chain community.  We're running the longest going resteem competition on the block.  I've helped a couple moms keep from getting evicted.  I've got some tickets for folks to Steemfest.  I've posted hundreds of times.  I feel like I've done a lot of stuff.  This one is a new high for me.  

**We created a new account.**

## New Account - @music-community

Don't get me wrong.  I've created a ton of accounts.  I actively manage about 12 of them.  So, it's not like I've never done that before, but this is a different thing.  Our interface brought a new account onto the block!

See that?!?  Steemmonsters create account @music-community!  We did that.  It took less than 24 hours and people are already making accounts with us!

## What's different about this?

See that recovery account?  It's us!  If someone gets their account hacked and needs to change keys and ownership the account owner comes to us.  We didn't just create this account and leave it.  We have some responsibility for it's well-being.  I've done the deadbeat dad account creation where I made an account and someone else is responsible for it.  Now it's me and Yaba.  We're Steem Dads!

## It feels different and I feel proud

Anyway.  I just wanted to share this.  Maybe a few computer geeks might get how cool this is with me.  I'm feeling extra proud of what we've done and wanted to share that.  Thanks for using our interface for your new account @music-community.  Glad to have you with us, and here's looking forward to many more accounts and monsters in the world.
