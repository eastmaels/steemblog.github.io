That's right folks.  It's pure Tippy whale balz and genital art this evening as we go down and dirty with Top Canadian Witness Kyle.  Come prepared with questions on style, MS Paint, and best ways to draw a whale sack.  We'll also hit the more serious notes on being a Witness, growing community, and what makes Steemit so damn special to us.

You can listen live at mspwaves.com/listen.

You can tune into the text portion of the show at https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy.

## Delegation <h2>

We'll have a 500 SP delegation go out live on the show.  You gotta be a minnow.  When you've earned a few thousand SP on teh platform or had this for a few months I'll take it back.  Until then enjoy.

To be eligible sign into the show and recruit some folks into it.  Just make them say "I'm here cause X sent me!"

Every person who enters the show claiming you brought = 1 ticket in the delegation raffle.

If we roll a one I'll push it to next week.

## Dice Bitches <h2>

We'll have 25 SBD go out during the show.

Tie or beat my roll and move onto the next round.
Last person standing wins.  If it's me we'll repeat the game.  If it's me twice this time it'll go to @msp-waves to cover server costs!
