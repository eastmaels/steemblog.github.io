The weekly town hall is tonight.  We'll likely talk about the Steem Alliance, Steemit's new direction, and the happenings on the platform.

Come join us and have a mic handy if you'd like to come on air.  Candidates for the working group are welcome if they'd like to share some details about themselves and try to get some votes!


Show starts in 3 hours and 30 min from this post!
