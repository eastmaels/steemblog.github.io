While there were many great conversations on the Minnow Mayor Town Hall last night I want to highlight two very cool conversations.  The first one is with @timcliff.  We spend over an hour talking about converting steem to sbd as part of a new hardfork.  We don't agree on when to implement, but I do think eventually it's a good call (I think we need to be bigger or have some other external things happen at first).  We talk about new user experience and what it's like to be a witness.  I find Tim especially charming, smart, and kind spirited and credit him as my Witness mentor.

This starts about 90 min in.  The second really fun interview is with @theywillkillyou and @world5list.  These guys run two YouTube channels that collectively have 1.8M subs.  They are also starting a crypto trading channel.  It's fun to hear them talk about Steem.  They both seem jazzed about the creative outlet that this platform provides.  @theywillkillyou even got his mom in the audience!!!  So, this feels like a point of pride and @world5list was talking about really feeling more passioante about the creative process again.  YouTube is feeling more business these days and more corporate.  On Steem he feels more able to pursue content that interests him.

This next convo starts around 2:15 into the show.  I'm happy to interview 3 new steemians!  @erinn @zoeyartanddesign @ruckuschica are all members of the "Unfuckers" started by my friend @daniarnold.  We talk some about conspiracies and how we can change the world.

@isaria channels her inner Kubby!!!  We talk about hosting a Live Steem Music performance!  
starts at the 7 min mark.  @clayboyn reads a love poem... but to whom?
@teamsteem runs a celebrity look alike contest.  Seth Rogan, Louis CK, and Lotni "Sloth" Fratelli from Goonies (the mutant) all won.
around the 16min mark @r0nd0n and I talk about our experience earlier that day looking at the GEET system.  We talk about next steps.

I'm looking into getting a user Generator that's about 10-20k Watts to start powering a breaker or my house itself.
