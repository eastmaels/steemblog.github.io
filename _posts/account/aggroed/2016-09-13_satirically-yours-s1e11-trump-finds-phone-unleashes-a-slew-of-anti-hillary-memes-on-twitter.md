<p>"This is gonna be Yuge" the presidential candidate gleefully reports to @aggroed from Satirically Yours as he scrolls through memes to put into Twitter.</p>
<p>"Hey get a load of this one!" He yells as he flicks me his phone. &nbsp;"This is what it should have looked like while she was on the plane." &nbsp;He laughs triumphantly.</p>

<p>I ask him about his economic policies, but he's too busy scrolling and posting. &nbsp;"Oh shit. &nbsp;Look at what I just did. She's never going to recover from this." &nbsp;He looks smug. &nbsp;"Get it, recover from this, both in the polls and from the illness. &nbsp;She's so fucked! &nbsp;It's great." &nbsp;He says.</p>

<p>Again after I ask him if he's willing to talk about peaceful and diplomatic solutions to the proxy war that appears to be playing out in Syria between various factions fighting on behalf of what looks like the Russians and the United States he brushes me off. &nbsp;"Look, we can talk about that stuff after the election. &nbsp;Until then we have to win the election. &nbsp;This meme is definitely going to do it!"</p>

<p>The Donald begins laughing pretty hard at this point. &nbsp;"I know I shouldn't be spreading things like this, but come on. &nbsp;The entire intelligence community knows that she sent out a double. &nbsp;I'm still trying to figure out if the scene that played out was an arrest and if the footage aired by ABC announcing her death was legitimate. &nbsp;Oh, look what I found here."</p>
<p><img src="https://s16.postimg.org/wi86ikrp1/double.jpg" width="461" height="519"/></p>
<p>"Look at her. &nbsp;She looks 50. &nbsp;She's 68. &nbsp;I wouldn't want to date her now. &nbsp;America doesn't want an unsexy woman as President. &nbsp;I mean Palin was hot enough to pull it off, but her, no way. &nbsp;And I don't know any pneumonia treatment that takes off 50 lbs overnight. &nbsp;It's simple. &nbsp;It's done. &nbsp;She used a double."</p>
<p>I tried to ask more questions, but he shooed me away. &nbsp;Looks like if we want real answers to petty questions it's faster just to message him on Twitter.</p>
