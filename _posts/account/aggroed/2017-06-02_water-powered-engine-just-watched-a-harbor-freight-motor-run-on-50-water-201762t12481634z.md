Well, I might be a sucker, but I just saw a generator run on 50% water.  He started it with full gas.  Then he stopped it and poured in water.  He was able to start the engine up again and run it on the 50:50 mix.

The parts necessary to do it are cheap.  So the next plan is to buy a 10kw generator from harbor freight tools.  Retrofit it.  And run mining rigs off of it.  

10kw generator would run 8 mining rigs safely.  Mine makes about $15/day.  So eight of those would be $120/day.  Fuel cost is 1 tank every 12 hours, but the tank can be up to 80% water.  So that's about a gallon per day.  I suppose I am about to toss away about $1000 to try this, but on the off chance it works I'm gonna make some good money for letting computers run.
