# The Peace Academy with @aggroed and @isaria: Episode 13 Tonight on MSP-Waves and in PALnet! (9-10PM EST)


The idea of Global Consciousness is that we are all connected through a universal consciousness.
The idea dates back 2000 years to The Emerald Tablet of Hermes and continues to this day throughout various philosophical, theological, and esoteric views.
This idea has even been the basis of study for some scientists and researchers of Quantum Mechanics.


Keeping this idea in mind while implementing the Non-Aggression Principle can help us achieve peace within our lives and throughout our communities.  More detail regarding NAP will be forth coming as it's a central tenet to peace.
