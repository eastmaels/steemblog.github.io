<p>In all likelihood you aren't from here. &nbsp;The world around you and the people around you have changed, sometimes subtly, and you may not have even noticed. &nbsp;Media, history, geography, religion, and anatomy among others have changed. &nbsp;However; not everyone has experienced all the changes.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with the Mandela Effect I have a study that I talk about here-</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe65g0K8ePc</p>
<p>Assuming that the problem isn't simply memory loss or mass confusion we're left to figure out what might be happening. &nbsp;While doing this people inevitably talk about multiple universes, timelines, realities, dimensions, and planets. &nbsp;Especially because the effect appears to be new for most people (80% of survey respondents say they haven't experienced it before July of 2015) we need a term to group all of those under one umbrella. &nbsp;I'm proposing and will be using the term Mandelo (the o is to separate it from the person Mandela). &nbsp;</p>
<p>A <strong>mandelo </strong>is an unbiased umbrella term to reference all potential former places of origin possible. &nbsp;Potential origin sites include things like realities, dimensions, timelines, universes, consciousness planes etc.</p>
<p>While I still don't have a clue as to what causes the Mandela Effect I've picked up on a few things while doing this research.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Some people knew of them back before 2012, some people between 2012-2015, but most people started experiencing them July 2015 or after.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Not all people experience all of the Mandela Effects and it's not simply age related. &nbsp;Some older people will share that the line for Snow White has always been Magic Mirror and many will report it's always been Mirror Mirror. &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;People, including NASA engineers who were surveyed, believe that the Earth has moved it's location in the galaxy by 80,000 light years.</p>
<p>Based on that evidence I have several initial models I'm more inclined to believe for what may be happening.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;People are experiencing implanted memories on a mass scale</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;We live in a simulation where there are multiple similar worlds and our soul has been implanted into our current avatar. &nbsp;This simulation is different than the last.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Mandelos are merging and each mandelo had variations. &nbsp;As they merge one variation may become dominant (Mirror Mirror) or people may remember it multiple ways (Sex in/and the City).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Those are my favorite explanations as of right now as any explination has to account for how the number of people that recall differences changes over time, so it's as if new populations of people enter into this current mandelo every so often from a different mandelo. &nbsp;The story has to account for how the planet seems to have changed position either because "simulated" stars are in different places or because the planet has actually moved. &nbsp;Lastly, it has to account for people having experienced two or more different sets of events.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The closest parallel story I can think of involves World of Warcraft servers. &nbsp;Imagine server 1, 2, and 3. &nbsp;As the population of the server decreased over time imagine that WoW merged servers but didn't tell them. &nbsp;People from server 1 would think X guild was the first to beat a boss and from their perspective that would be true. &nbsp;If people came from server B they would have many quests and races that are similar, but details like who was the first guild to destroy boss X would be different. &nbsp;Imagine both 1 and 2 coexisted for a while and then server 3 was transferred in. &nbsp;Now there would be 3 sets of memories about roughly the same content, but with different details that have emerged. &nbsp;Again, this isn't to say this is what's happening, but it's the closest analogy to what I can find.</p>
