<p>If you've been an activist as long as I have you will likely have run into censorship on YouTube and Facebook. &nbsp;I had multiple accounts (in a row, not at the same time) on Facebook that I brought up to 2-3k friends and a substantial followers list and I've been blocked from those accounts multiple times. &nbsp;It was infuriating. &nbsp;I'm posting something about how the Russia tower fires are ongoing for 27hrs without collapsing and suddenly I'm being asked to identify pictures of friends to show I am who I am. &nbsp;Since lots of my friends are Anonymous types they are all wearing masks. &nbsp;So I couldn't tell and they wouldn't reinstate the account.</p>
<p>I'm not the only one. &nbsp;Knowledge of Today was a 1M+ user subscribed page and the whole page was shut down. &nbsp;</p>

<p>And <a href="http://libertyhangout.org/2016/07/save-liberty-memes-facebook-threatens-to-shut-down-popular-libertarian-page/">Liberty Memes</a> admin 1 is still on suspension for this Hillary Meme.</p>

<p>And honestly, it isn't that racy or insulting. &nbsp;It's just suggesting that there are two sets of laws.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-09-15/youtube-has-quietly-begun-censoring-journalists-who-criticize-government">Youtube </a>is doing the same thing with who they are letting get paid through adsense.</p>

<p>The other thing I see happen a lot is FB doesn't let me see posts that I'm interested in. &nbsp;You would think maybe they don't post some things on my page, but it's gotten bad enough that pages that I routinely watch and know when people post on I still can't see the post I'm looking for. &nbsp;I have to the page, use search, and only then when I am clearly looking for that exact post can I see it.</p>
<p>Enter reblog on STEEMIT and the blockchain. &nbsp;This site will grow and I probably won't see everything useful to me, but I know that if the blog is out there I'll find it, and if I share it that it will stay on my page. &nbsp;When it becomes clear that you can use STEEMIT as an alternative news feed stream this place is going to erupt.</p>

<p>Loud applause on this one.</p>
