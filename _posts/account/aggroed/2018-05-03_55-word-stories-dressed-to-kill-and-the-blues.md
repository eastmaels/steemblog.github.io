She looked dead sexy from across the room.
Dressed in a tight black skirt with eyes that can kill.
Will mustered.  I venture forth.
I fall under her spell in moments.  She's smart and captivating too.
We go to her house.  I slip off my clothes asking what she does for work.
"I'm an assassin..."

He struck a note on the guitar and then another.  
Melody with a standard blues rift.  
He belted out his words like he was letting us hear his broken heart.  
He dreamed about the girl that got away living with a man he'd always hate with a smile he'd never see.  
Sad eyes sank without her.
