So, I’m still at the airport.  American Airlines lied to the passengers and kept pushing the flight time back until they decided we weren’t gonna go.  So, I’m just chilling in charlotte.  Shoulda left at 8 pm, now I’m not leaving till 9am.  Gotta love travel when when it goes double digits hour wise.

The photo is a picture of a turtle I took with my second daughter on a nature ride.  I want to be home.  So much time is spent removing parents from children in this modern setup.  I think a lot has to do with the state foisting itself in a parental position to act like a shitty abusive parent to the youth.  They want us dependent.  A strong family unit is anti-thetical to that.  So, find ways to separate child and parent and create dependency while the parent is absent.  I try to spend lots of time with my kids to help correct state influence on my family.


## hives

Still have hives.  Going on day three I think.  Against my best thoughts I took some benedryl.  I have health concerns about it, but I was feeling wired and itchy.  So, I broke my standing rule of no western meds.  Slept well, but I’m groggy and still have these little things.  All told there are probably 400 of these on me.  At least my privates don’t have them.  Currently just my knees and elbows.

I believe that the universe unfolds as it should.  I think the hives are necessary to draw attention to something or release something from me.  I’ll send it reiki and hope that I can achieve balance and health.

## witness

I caught a whale vote so now I’m witness 7.  This is tied for the all time high rank I’ve had.  When I’m in the top ten I stop checking my position every day and just work.  Feels good to be back here.  

People say the witness rankings don’t change much.  It usually happens at times like yesterday when the chain needs leaders and people who are actively here and watching.  My node wasn’t the first one up, but it was top 5.  I was happy to let Gandalf and Tim take the lead.  They are Devs.  I am not.  I’m happy to let smart awesome people lead smartly and awesomely.  I’m really impressed by the team and how we executed.

People many thought were solid haven’t updated yet.  And so the rankings changed quite a bit.  We will see how long this lasts.  This gig is 24/7.  Tim told me that when I was first starting.  It’s a lovely reminder to be 1000 miles from home covered in hives in a hotel that smells like cigarette assholes at 3am fucking around with nodes from a work laptop.  It’s not all sunshine and producer rewards.

## stake weighted voting

The witness system we have is pretty incredible.  It’s hard to do 1 person one vote when bots and actors can fake things.  I mean... you seen how many dead democrats vote?  Fraud propels American democracy.

Stake weighted isn’t equal to all but at least it’s equal opportunity to all.  I’m hoping one day Steem will have a better distribution on the platform, but even with my major concern this place did it’s job.  The witness system is pretty incredible how 100+ people fight for 20 slots.

Bad actor did bad thing, chain stopped, steemit debugged, witnesses got it running.  Some witnesses who weren’t present got replaced by backup witnesses.  In hours we are back up and running.  The state of Steem is strong.  My home is good and despite its flaws we are chugging along.  That feels like Independance to me.  Many blessings of peace, abundance, and liberty to those who worked late into the night to get this baby running.

Your money is safe, your projects are safe, and arguably things are better.  I’ll be here and I’ll be working.  I mean, if I slip there are 80+ people with their hands raised saying “put me in coach.”  

Steem isn’t just gonna moon itself.  We collectively have more work to do, and I’m honored to do this work with you all.

Aggy
