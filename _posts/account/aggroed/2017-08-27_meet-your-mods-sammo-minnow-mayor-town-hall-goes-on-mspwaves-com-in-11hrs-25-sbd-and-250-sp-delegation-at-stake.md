We've met Shane (@swelker101) and we've met @gmuxx.  Let's go say hello to @sammosk!  The creator and key holder for msp-creativebot.

If you've hung out in the Minnow Support Project for a while you might see that people Level Up every so often.  We have a variety of pre-programmed Discord Bots in there.  Tatsumaki is one of them.  Tat keeps a log of how much people are talking in the channels in PALnet for us.  Every 20 sec or so it will award some points if you're typing in a channel.  Sammo is clearly in the lead on the top typer charts.  So, if there is anyone you've met in PAL it's probably him!

## The Questions! <h2>

When did you hear about the MSP?
## @sammosk- I was scrolling through the digital ocean I think day 2 or 3, checking out comments and posts and saw the minnowsupport tagline, thought to myself, yeah I'm one of those things. Joined, a week or two later, working at supporting everyone full time.

Why did you join the MSP?
## @sammosk- I joined because the idea of collaborating and supporting one another seemed like a fantastic idea. Emergence is a thing. Super powerful.

What do you think is the best aspect of the MSP?
## @sammosk- The nurturing, kindness and love that I have seen within the project. The effort and time spent on one another empowering and uplifting. This makes me very pleased.

You're a moderator what does that mean to you?
## @sammosk-  What being a moderator means to me? A hundred thousand characters a day or more haha. Means I have to take a breath and be better (thanks crimmy) sometimes. It is a way for me to balance myself more effectively and to reach out and empower others along the way with a gentle nudge or some words. It means I can take someones hand who is lost and journey with to a better place.  I actually love it.

What's your service project?
## @sammosk- @msp-creativebot, it is a project designed to support and uplift creative and original content. Simple guidelines to follow 1-3 posts max per day, a delegation of anywhere from 10-100sp to anywhere you'd like. And original content.  It acts as a force multiplier, a way to encourage higher quality posting, a (once commited) hands-free communal effort and I believe it is one of the most awesome things I have done with/for MSP and PAL. I love that lil bot and each and everyone of its supporting members. <3

how much time do you spend on MSP stuff?
## @sammosk-  I don't sleep, I rarely eat, attached to the tea cup by a siphon. I think this answers your question. The support never ends, it is a blessing and a curse and part of the reason why I asked for more mods and some changes to further distribute the load to avoid burnout. I know I should be fine, but worry about others sometimes.

Why does it matter to you so much?
## @sammosk-  It's a community founded without borders on the blockchain, what more to say about how amazing and unreal this is?

We need some channel mods, why should people do it?
## @sammosk- Because it is one way to give back to the community, build a network and support the palnet discord and msp. We need to distribute tasks further to people who are interested in actually performing them and so I encourage anyone who is active in a particular niche or channel to put hand up and consider showing some interest. Plus it is part of the ladder you should climb if you wish to become a fully fledged mod. 

What excites you about Steemit?
## @sammosk- The ability to perform one to many communications or one to one communications stored permanently on the chain without fear of censorship. The ability to reach out, touch, and be touched is my primary source of amaze regarding steemit, the technology is okay, the financial reward, also cool but not the be all to end all.  I have some barriers in my life that I am trying to break through and forcing myself onto a public blockchain backed platform like Steemit I believe will help me through them.

What's a long term vision for where Steemit is going?and how do you fit into that?
## @sammosk-  Crushing every single social platform out there would be a great goal. Where do I fit in on that? holding the hand of as many users along the way. Having worked as a CSO/Helpdesk for many many years, I am somewhat suitable for that task hahaha.

What can MSP be doing better?  
## @sammosk- I prefer to focus on the positives. 

How can minnows contribute to the system and grow their accounts?
## @sammosk-  There are myriad ways to give back, a small account could follow and vote on minnowsupports or its supporters posts, the bot accounts @muxxybot @msp-shanehug @msp-creativebot @msp-lovebot and so on.

## A larger account may delegate some SP to any of the above projects.

## You could talk in chat, engage with one another on there or in voip, offer feedback on community projects or in the huge list of channels.

## Personally I find the human touch to be the best, go and manually curate, upboat, throw a comment on it. And most of all, have a good time, be good to one another, and spread the minnow love. <3

What else would you want to share here?
## @sammosk- Just try to reserve judgement where possible, de-escalate, empower, uplift, love and be good to and for one another. We are all here to help one another and ourselves, not cut each other down. So just try to keep that in mind. 

Balance all the things. <3
