Woah, ok, busy day working to promote the Steem ecosystem.  I have 3 shows I'm going to be on today.  So, let's do a quick run down.

## Starting in about 3.0 hours I'll be joining @beanz on her VOTU podcast <h2>

She and I have some differing opinions on the utility of bidbots on the platform.  We'll be discussing that.  Her live podcast starts at 2:30pm est (3.0 hrs from now).  Should be fun.  You're welcome to join as a live audience and hit us with hard hitting questions.

## Steem and PALnet Orientation <h2>

I'm hosting an orienation tonight at 8pm est.  That's about 8.5hrs from this post.  The goal is to welcome people to the platform, help them get used to Steem, encourage them, and recruit for both steem and the Minnow Support Project.  If you're still trying to figure out how this place works then here's a great opportuninty for you to get to know how Steem works and make some friends in the largest off chain Steem community.

## Minnow Mayor Town Hall with Special Guest David Pakman <h2>

I have a weekly radio show.  It's hosted through Discord on PALnet (https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy) and live also on mspwaves.com/listen.  This week I have special guest @davidpakman.  He's the host of a progressive political youtube channel that has hundreds of thousands of subscribers.  He's recently joined Steem and I'm going to welcome him to the platform and help introduce him and his audience to Steem, PALnet, and the Minnow Support Project.  He'll hopefully share some of his experience with us so far and what we can do to make our platform appeal to his audience.

That show starts at 9pm EST (9.5 hrs from now) and directly follows the orientation broadcast.

## 250SP Delegation <h2>
On the Minnow Mayor Town Hall I'll be handing out a 250SP delegation.  If you go on air your name gets entered into the lottery for the delegation.  Delegations have to go to a minnow.  They will remain on the user for ~6 months or until they are no longer minnows.

## Dice Bitches <h2>
We play a game live on air called Dice Bitches where I'll give away 25Steem.

To play I'll roll dice using the command `t!dice 15d15` then you do it too.  If your roll ties or beats mine you can roll in the next round.  The next round we'll lower the dice to 14d14 to keep track.  If I win once we start over from scratch and everyone is back in.  If I win twice I send the steem to @msp-waves.
