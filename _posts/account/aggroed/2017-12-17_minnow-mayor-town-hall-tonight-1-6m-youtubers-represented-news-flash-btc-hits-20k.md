Giant show tonight.  We have some big people and big plans to discuss!  Over 1.6M Youtubers will be represented on the show primarily by three key people.

@davidpakman from the David Pakman Show is going to bring a left wing political audience of 400k from YouTube.
@theywillkillyou via Angelo has 1M YouTube audience.
@brianturner with a 200k YouTube audience will be there too.

That's 1,600,000 people represented and hopefully made more aware of Steem and how this blockchain community can help them.

## That's a big deal, but here's the plan <h2>

What's starting as a conversation in a 1 on 1 Town Hall style is going to morph into a panel discussion (we'll talk about this on the show).  The goal is to bring people that have 5M Youtube subscribers on the show and have them talk about their experience and what it might mean for them on Steem and with Steem.  This is framed by the ongoing adpocolapsye  where YouTube is demonitizing content and basically financially censoring people who have opinions they or their corporate sponsors don't like.

I know a Blockchain that could help, and I know a distributed YouTube service that might come in handy!

## Show Logistics <h2>

The show is on tonight from 8pm-11pm (we often run over).  Show starts at 0100 UTC.  The format is a Town Hall style where folks from the audience are welcome to come on air.  This one is a little different because we have 3 invited guests.  So, when they are around I'll be sure to give them preference for on air time, but in between the invited guests the general public is welcome to come on air and hangout with me. Standard rules apply, you can voice concerns or complaints, you can promote yourself, others, or projects, and you can perform some too if you'd like, but just make sure that you're not doing personal attacks.  PALnet and MSP are do no harm, but take no shit land.  Short leashes for anyone that wants to attack others or Steemit (complaints and concerns are ok, but characters attacks get people muted, kicked, and banned).

You will need a working mic and a headset if you want to participate on air. 


## Funky Aside <h2>

Still working on putting together an all inclusive Crypto Forum.  @haejin is building up quite a name and following as a crypto trader.  Seems like he's willing to come on air not this Sunday, but on Christmas Eve.  Should be fun, but only if you're interested in making gobs of money from his trading tips and advice.

## News Alert <h2>

BTC hits 20k.  More money to be plowed into crypto.  Good times!

## Delegation <h2>

Delegation will happen tonight as per normal, but I'm putting out a notice.  I'm likely going to shift how I've been doing delegation.  I'm going to start another msp account dedicated to the audience and I'm going to shift from a delegation model to individuals to a community pot that all the DJs can use to add their active listeners onto the autovoter.  For now it stays the same... but it may be changing.

## Dice Bitches <h2>

I'll be giving away 50 steem on air.  We do this through dice.  Roll dice with the `t!dice 10d10` command, and then I'll shrink it to 9d9 and so on.  If you beat or tie my roll you can move onto the next round.  If you win you get the money.  If I win it goes to msp-waves.
