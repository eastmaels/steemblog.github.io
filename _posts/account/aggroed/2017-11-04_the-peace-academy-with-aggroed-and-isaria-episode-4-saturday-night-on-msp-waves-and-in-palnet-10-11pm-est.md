It’s hard to believe that we’re already up to Episode 4!

We’ve had some pretty intense conversations so far regarding peace, liberty, personal boundaries, energy, conflict resolution, and time.

Peace, Abundance, and Liberty aren’t just nouns. They are more like verbs in that we are constantly striving to achieve them.
Every week we plan to examine more ways in which we can do this together.

***We also want to hear from you!***

If you would like to share your thoughts regarding Peace, Abundance, and Liberty then just join us in the audience chat and let us know!

The Peace Academy is an initiative to help Steemians learn how to implement Peace, Abundance, and Liberty within our community, as well as our daily lives.

## MSPSTEEM <h2>

If you notice the url for this post starts with mspsteem.com.   MSPSteem is run by @netuoso as an alternative site to steemit.com and has one additional benefit.  It has a 5% beneficiary applied to @minnowsupport.  So, every post made with this helps the Minnow Support Project just a little bit.  Pretty soon @aggroed is going to start searchign the mspsteem tag for people that used mspsteem and start hitting them with minnowsupport votes and resteems.

If you'd like to login to see, vote, comment, or resteem in the normal way then checkout: https://steemit.com/peaceacademy/@aggroed/the-peace-academy-with-aggroed-and-isaria-episode-4-saturday-night-on-msp-waves-and-in-palnet-10-11pm-est
