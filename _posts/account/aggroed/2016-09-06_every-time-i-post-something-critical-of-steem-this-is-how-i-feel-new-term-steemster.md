<p>I'm currently on a kick that STEEM is currently an electronic oligarchy and not in any way a truly representative place for the people to add their voice.</p>
<p>I get it, it's better than Facebook. Every time I post something negative though I'm waiting for the STEEMSTERS to come out and rip me a new one.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm just paranoid because I am a conspiracy theorist too. &nbsp;That's a legit possibility. &nbsp;Actually, worse than their critisism is the real possibility that my opinion that's contrary to everything is awesome is going to lead me to get downvotes and then I really won't have a voice. &nbsp;Part of me is just waiting for Dan and Ned to smite this post and my account for saying parts of the execution of their project are completely undemocratic.</p>
<p>Oh well. &nbsp;Here's my plan irregardless (yes, I know that's not a real word).</p>

<p>Maybe if I invest $20,000 into STEEM then I can have a voice too. &nbsp;Isn't that how this place works? &nbsp;One celebrity comes down here, drops a few large and suddenly their posts are all the rage. &nbsp;Maybe we'll get one of the Kardashians and we can have a really wonderful discussion then about how having rich people have voices is the best system.</p>
