<p>If you're looking to die slower than you can say "Venezuelan Socialism" while protesting via unintended hunger strike Satirically Yours has the answer. &nbsp;Inspired by a post by @charlieshrem to "<a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@charlieshrem/how-to-live-completely-off-steem-using-a-virtual-and-physical-debit-card-topped-up-with-steem">Live completely off of STEEM</a>" authors at Satirically Yours were up to the <strong>STEEM only challenge</strong>.</p>
<p>By diverting the ~$4 from the last 9 posts made by content creator @aggroed into their STEEM credit card they were able to purchase a small bag of rice for the family of 4 to eat over the course of several days while other low volume posts picked up pennies at a time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>@aggroed while nearly crippled from hunger and exhaustion had this to say "I didn't really appreciate how much groceries cost my family until I switched from using USD at a salaried position to using STEEM, which as 98% of the community knows is an unobtainable commodity." &nbsp;The interview nearly stopped then as he moved to comfort his two screaming children, also involuntarily lending their support to the hunger strike, but his spouse returned with donated bread and dinner from dumpster diving a local grocery store.</p>

<p>"I mean I'm trying to do this. &nbsp;I want to be like @charlieshrem" @aggroed shared. "But I can't pay rent, utilities, schools loans, or buy food. &nbsp;Honestly, four dollars doesn't get you very far in America. &nbsp;Since I don't want my family to die I think we're going to have to give up on this experiment."</p>
<p>Stay tuned for additional helpful advice and suggestions from whale accounts.&nbsp;</p>
