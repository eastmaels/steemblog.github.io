Watch this.  The DNC argues "We could have voluntarily decided that, Look, we're gonna go into back rooms like they used to and smoke cigars and pick the candidate that way.  That's not the way it was done.  But they could have."

DNC is saying they are a private corporation and actually dont' have a fiduciary responsibility to do the things they are telling the public they are going to do.

For the record.  The USG is corporation masquarading as a government.  They can make the same arguments and be technically lawful.

Anyway, Bernie won, it was rigged, Hillary became the nominee, and Trump became president.  Bernie would have won a popular vote against Trump, but he allegedly sold out (three houses for a guy making $170k is an aweful lot of home for not that much salary).  So, there you go.
