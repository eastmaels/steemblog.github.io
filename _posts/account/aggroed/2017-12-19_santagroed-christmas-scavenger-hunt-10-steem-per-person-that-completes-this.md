With 7 days to Christmas I want to do a Scavenger hunt to help minnows on the platform out.  Mom always told me to leave the world better than I found it and here's a way I can try to live up to that.  I'm a little nervous with the price of things going haywire right now, but oh well.  It's Christmas.  Time to help minnows for the holidays, here's hoping you'll have a little more in your stocking this year.  

I'm the very proud founder of the Minnow Support Project, which is the largest off chain Discord community for Steemians.  We have a simple charter.  Promote the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  Help Steem grow.  Train and retain new members on the platform.  We have a couple programs that can help new people get started.  Now, because there's a pump and a lot of new people are going to join us I thought I'd go the extra step and pay you personally to get acquainted with some stuff you should be likely be doing anyway.  We have so many examples of success it's silly.  Basically you should be working with the Minnow Support Project as a new user, building a community around you by making friends in the PALnet Discord server, and I'd go so far as to say if you're not doing this you're Steeming wrong.

I'm going to give out 10 Steem per person that completes my Scavenger hunt.  I'll limit it to 60 people for now.  This may cost me a small fortune, but so be it.  If it goes haywire I may complete my first power down ever to pay, but we'll see how this baby goes.  Anyway, it's a bunch of steps, but these steps will help you grow and I'll send you something like 30USD (give or take 10? 20?) for having done it... so, there's that too.

## The Spirit of Steem Christmas <h2>

I believe in the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  We're going to use some random acts of kindness to help others and make them feel valued.  We're also going to practice some good behaviors.  And as a reward everyone that participates is getting 10 Steem.  You must be a minnow (5,000SP or less) or member of the Minnow Support Project to participate, and it's ok to become a member just to participate.

## Rules <h2>

Step 1.  Resteem this post (I'll resteem your entry later, but I'll do it to 8500 people on @aggroed or 7k on @minnowsupport so I'll pay you back for this!)

Step 2.  Create a post on mspsteem.com (this is a clone of steemit.com, but it has a 5% beneficiary to @minnowsupport and it's run by @netuoso) and put the following stuff in it:

Start by finding a good Christmas/Holiday pic from pixabay.com and linking that image.  If you wanna do something non-Christmas or some other holiday ok... get a yule log... 
- Find 3 minnows (people with under 5k Steem Power) and post a thoughtful comment on different posts.  I'll accept a meme or a gif with a friendly comment with it.  Take snapshots and include those in your mspsteem post.  Hopefully you'll gain some followers for this.
- Comment on 3 posts by dolphins or whales.  Take snapshots and put those in the post.  Hopefully you'll catch some nice votes for this.
-  Join the Minnow Support Project Discord Server called PALnet by clicking this: https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy.  Take a snapshot of you typing in there.  Hopefully you'll build a community around you by doing this.
-  Get registered in there and use the $upvote URL command to get a small vote from the account @minnowsupport.  Enjoy the vote as a free gift, and take a snapshot to show it happened! 
-  Compliment someone in PALnet (take a snapshot).  Hopefully you make a friend.
-  Listen to a mspwaves radio show and take a snapshot of yourself in the audience in Discord.  You can check out the schedule at mspwaves.com.  Post that image.  Hopefully you find some entertainment here and learn something about other Steemians.
-  Go to steemit.com/~witnesses and vote for any witness.  Hopefully you pick some from the Minnow Support Project, but they all count.  Take a snapshot of a witness vote you made and include it in the post.
-  Share your gratefuls.  Tell us three people and 3 things you're grateful for this end of year.
-  Share your hopefuls.  Tell us what you're looking forward to in 2018.
-  Share your freedoms.  Tell us what you're not going to carry into 2018.
-  Share a story of how the Minnow Support Project or someone in it helped you.

-  Optional: delegate any amount of Steem Power to @minnowsupport (doing so will earn you automatic upvote from @msp-lovebot) -  https://mspdelegator.herokuapp.com/mspdelegator.  Folks that delegate even just a handful of Steem Power are likely to catch larger votes from @minnowsupport.  Also, don't delegate unless you will still have more than 50Sp left on your account.


Step 3.  Publish your post (has to be on mspsteem) and link the post URL into the comments in here.  Use the tag Santagroed.

Step 4.  Aggroed and/or @minnowsupport will resteem it and you get some more followers.

Step 5.  Aggroed will send you 10 steem.

Step 6.  Extra good posts will receive large Christmas votes from @minnowsupport.

## Do this because it's fun.  The Steem is a just bonus! <h2>
