Ok, last reminder.  I'm hosting a Boston meetup this Saturday (tomorrow) at noon at the Black Rose in Boston.  I'm using the $136 bucks I made on the initial post about this  for appetizers and food.  So, come on down and make sure you visit us in Bean Town.

## Bid Bot owners meeting <h2>

Following that meetup I'll be hosting a Discord Meetup for Bid Bot owners at 2pm EST.

You can join us in here https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy.  We're going to try to broadcast it on mspwaves.com (I'll still be in the Irish Pub!)  The voice channel will be limited to people that own bid bots for the majority of the meeting as well as those with significant input into bid bots in general (devs who made tools, anti abuse folks like patrice, yabapmatt who made the tracker etc.)

Details are available here:  https://steemit.com/bidbot/@aggroed/discord-meetup-public-bid-bot-owners-meeting-saturday-2pm-est-1900-utc-in-palnet

## Peace Academy with @isaria <h2>

Tomorrow night I'm cohosting the Peace Academy on mspwaves.com/listen and also in PALnet Discord.  We'll be talking about managing personal conflict and having a better experience with that!  The show goes from 9pm-10pm (0200 UTC).
