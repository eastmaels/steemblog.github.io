https://agx123.herokuapp.com//2018-02-10.jpg<br/><br/>This is the daily AgX chart for today 2018-02-10.<br/>Today's 200 Moving Day average is 0.96.  The current STEEM/SBD ratio is 0.94.  The AgX is 0.97.

We're basically sitting on the average Steem:SBD ratio.  AgX doesn't tell you much here, but can be useful at the top or bottom of the ratio to show you the risk reward profile you may be keeping by holding there.

<h3>What is AgX?</h3><br/><br/>The Mayer's multiple (200 days moving average of the BTC/USD price) is known to be a good indicator of the BTC price evolution.
AgX aims to be a similar indicator regarding the STEEM/SBD ratio, in order for users to find the right moment to exchange their SBD for STEEM at the best possible rate.

Still working on some bugs for this, but I'll move it over to the account @agx in two weeks or so.
