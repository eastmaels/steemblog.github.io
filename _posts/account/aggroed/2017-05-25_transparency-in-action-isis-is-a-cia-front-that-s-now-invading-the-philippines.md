So, ISIS is giant terrorist group that we all need to live in fear of.  They commit atrocities.  They are made of up big, mean, scary, dark-skinned, Muslim men.  We have to stop them or they will behead us, sell us as slaves, and fuck all of our goats.

The problem though is that we know all of that stuff because the MSM told us so.  And you know you can't trust them right?!?

##  What the fuck is ISIS, a Middle Eastern Muslim Terrorist group doing in the Philippines? <h2>

It's a good question right?  You would think they'd be off enslaving locals or something, but instead they decided to take a 5,000 mile hop, skip, and a jump to the Philippines to fuck up an entirely different country.

## It seems to have started with this guy Duterte <h2>

He got himself elected.  He may or may not have supposed to be put in place there, but he did.  I tend to think he's anti-establishment as he's been doing a few key things.  He's killed drug deals and stopped Afghan heroin from going into Asia through the Philippines.  He's stopped buying weapons from the USA.  In one of the the greatest presidential press conferences of all time he called Obama a "Son of a whore."

Then he tacks on that's he's not against the US, but he's decided to shift from a US centric foreign policy to working more with Russia and China.

## That's when ISIS comes along and starts blowing shit up <h2>

Here's an article from yesterday.  Once he stopped buying guns and publicly switched allegiance  wouldn't you know it, but a battalion of evil Middle Eastern terrorists start blowing up the Philippines.

## So, that's pretty direct as far as I can tell <h2>
Go against the US and ISIS shows up at your door even if it's 5000 miles away from their base of operations.  If you haven't figured it out yet the USG is a war machine, a corporation masquerading as a government, and filled with violent blackmailed pedos.  

## It's not just about oil and trade.  It's about the world reserve currency <h2>

WTF is that?  Well, post WWII the world came to an arrangement about how money would be created and lines drawn etc.  it's part of the Brenton Woods stuff.  One of the things in there is that the USD became the world reserve currency.  You can walk into any country in the world and USD will be accepted for trade.  For large deals you have to buy shit in USD.  So, China technically has to sell yuan, buy USD, and then purchase oil with USD.

Iraq, Iran, Syria, and a host of other countries we've invaded dropped or were dropping the USD.  Yes, the oil is important because we have a petro dollar, meaning that all the money is completely fiat except for the oil it's exclusively traded in and the warships that protect it.  The real deal though is that the FED can now print paper and the world has to accept it as currency.  Back in the financial crisis of 2012 they literally printed in excess of $20 TRILLION DOLLARS.  Overnight they fucking popped out of no where more than the US GDP.  It's fuckin' unreal!

## As long as you use Federal Reserve notes you're part of the problem! <h2>
A main thing that brought me into Crypto was the day that I realized that people using a currency are what give it value, and by using the USD I was giving value to a currency that's used to cause amazing amounts of harm globally.  I don't want that.  So, I started this blog and will continue to use steem for more things as I collect more of it.  That's because it comes without guilt that I'm supporting the military industrial complex with my commerce.  I want peace, abundance, and liberty.  The FED supports none of those.
