I've been able to assemble an exceptional crew of people to talk about spreading the Steem blockchain across many other social media platforms.

@andrarchy (Steemit), @heimindanger (Dtube), @prc (Dsound) represent the technology side of what the Steem platform is capable of.

@theywillkillyou (1M subs on youtube), @world5list (800k subs on youtube), @davidpakman (400k subs on youtube, syndicated on radio and satellite tv/radio), @doghaus (tv and radio is Canada), @careywedler (100k subs on facebook, 40k youtube, and editor in chief of the anti-media) represent social medias success stories that are in various stages of migrating towards Steem as a sustainable revenue model.

This panel discussion focuses on aligning the Steem platform need for external exposure and growth with media personality needs for sustainable revenue and scalable technology solutions.  Developers are on hand to talk about progress and plans, and the various shows can talk about requirements and experience so far.

It drastically impacted usage.
