The universe teaches through contrast.  So, I've made a highly bureaucratic government the antagonist and a free loving libertarian voluntaryst community the protagonist.  Let's see what happens to Admiral Santanta.

## CH1 Episode 3 Plummeting with a Techtab and Solarnet"


For a lot of people dropping at above mach speeds plummeting towards the ground in a hunk of steel labelled "life support ship" you'd probably be freaked out of your mind, screaming, or passed out.  But to Santana this was just another day at the office.  When you fight for freedom your ship's gonna get blown up a few times.  Oh well, the last couple life boats worked out ok.

She knows the drill by now.  When she saw 3 torps coming in post slider heading for baby-3 she knew what was up.  Hit the big red "abandon ship" button, punch in the code, grab her techtab, retrieve the video logs, and hop in the life boat.  A lot of her crew and friends were dead.  That happens too...  There's gonna be a long bath and a few bottles of wine for today, and by wine she means straight gin.  Mistakes demand their due.

Anyway, back to the task at hand.  She pulls out the techtab and logs into solarnet.  Luckily reception is good because she can see the satellite about 1 click from her head.  

"Tarthi, pull up libertygov.net for me please."

Libertygov.net pulls up.  Woah, 320,412 new messages.  Oh, right.  She was broadcasting the fight with the raiders.  I guess they're paying attention.

"Tarthi, submit new post."

"Tarthi, roll film"

Hi guys.  This is Admiral Santana floating back to home.  As you can see it's a little rough in the atmosphere right now.  I think I'm falling at about 534megalons per second.  Anyway, as you might have seen, I had a little run in with the Kartouri Raiders.  Good news is that the planet is safe and none of you are dead.  I can't wait to see you mom.  The bad news is that they blew up my ship.  I try not to ask you guys for too much, but seeing as I did just save the planet again if you could kindly upvote this so I can get a new ship and keep the planet safe that'd be really awesome.

I'm hoping for some improvements, so if a few megaloths could hit it with their megaloth balls or just DM some Liberty Scripts to my wallet that would be great.  I think the shields need moar power.  Also, I seem to have lost some crew so if you're ready to die to keep this place safe from the Karts then hit me up when I land.

Love you guys and thanks for your support.  

Peace, Abundance, and Liberty to you all.

Santana out.

## Episode 2 <h2>

60 seconds ago Captain Tanic Elotaw of the Dreadnaught class ship Peace Enforcer 782215 was an extremely happy man.  
55 seconds ago he had damaged just about every last weapon system of the terrorist flagship Unsanctioned Peace Defiance 01500-7. 
50 seconds ago his chief weapons officer had successfully taken their main thrusters offline with a precision rail gun disabling impact.  
45 seconds ago he recorded a highly dampened energy signal suggesting the ship's main power was severely compromised.  
40 seconds he saw all the shields finally go offline.  
35 seconds ago he saw a life form readout suggesting that 72% of the suspected lifeforms had been neutralized.  
30 seconds ago he received a surrender message from Planet 143-2 in known system 45-66-2, the main host of the terrorist insurrection 15-11889-302.   
25 seconds ago his chief medical officer confirmed Admiral Santana was still alive and would be available for detention and interrogation.  
20 seconds ago there was a heat signature launched from the terrorist vessel.  
15 seconds ago counter measures were taken.  
10 seconds ago those counter measures failed to destroy the ballasitc.  
5 seconds ago a sphere emanated from the warhead.  
Now he was no longer happy.

Tanic tugged down on the bottom of his stiff uniform.  Calm and control was needed.  He realized while looking at his display that the ballastic was likely a quantum slider, and he was likely in a parallel dimension in an unknown time and space along with approximately 62% of his ship that happened to be enveloped in the slide.  If enough of the ship was left in tact a supra reality frequency jump through a quantum singularity might get him back.  Normally, he'd be pissed, but 3 peace keeping zero gravity advanced targeted thrust tubes (torpedoes) were launched before slider impact and the last readouts on his screen suggested they escaped the slide sphere.  3 red blips were on their way to eliminate the threat imposed by the Peace Defiance vessel and "Admiral" Santana was likely littered over space as 1,000 or more frozen blood, bone, and flesh debris floating into nothingness .  

One engine should be enough to get back, but will he get back at the right time to see her die with his very own eyes?
