Ok, Just recorded a video that discusses my primary interpretation of what's going on in Syria right now.  It is my general sense that Obama and the previous administration was propping up ISIS and the rebels and shooting for regime change in Syria.  When Hillary lost ISIS started getting trampled, but there were still strongholds of rebel forces acting against Assad who had been propped up by the CIA and the Obama whitehouse.

It would appear that the Trump administration has orchestrated an attack on those remaining forces with Russia and Syria.  The US is providing air support to take out the chemical weapons research facility near Damascus.  Russia is coordinating with Syria to kill a lot of rebel soldiers on the ground.  

It appears that Russia is also taking somewhat aggressive posture with French forces to keep them at bay.  Ultimately it looks like the US only used missiles and has otherwise let Russia and Syrian forces kick out ISIS.

This information comes from https://twitter.com/Anon_decoder, an anon who seems to have live information reported by anons on the ground sharing what they are seeing and hearing.  I've put together a video that walks through the information that anon_decoder has gotten so far tonight to walk through this version of the narrative.

Summary- USA/Russia/Syria coordinated an attack on Deep State violent/criminal ISIS/rebel forces.

Backup theory- Trump and the military generals that make up his cabinet and prop up his presidency have gone insane and just started WWIII.  So, far I'm leaning 85:15 that the primary is correct.
