https://agx123.herokuapp.com//2018-02-21.jpg<br/><br/>This is the daily AgX chart for today 2018-02-21.<br/>Today's 200 day moving average is 0.93 with a  a STEEM/SBD ratio of 0.81.<h3>What is AgX?</h3><br/><br/>The Mayer's multiple (200 days moving average of the BTC/USD price) is known to be a good indicator of the BTC price evolution.
AgX aims to be a similar indicator regarding the STEEM/SBD ratio, in order for users to find the right moment to exchange their SBD for STEEM at the best possible rate. When the blue line is near the top sell Steem.  When the blue line is at the bottom sell SBD.

We're down to just 1-2 more before this moves to @agx.
