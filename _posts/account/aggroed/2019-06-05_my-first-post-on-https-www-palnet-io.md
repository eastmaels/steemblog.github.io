I gotta tell ya.  It feels pretty good to make a post on a crypto blogging site that I helped to create!  I imagine there's some haters out there saying because i'm not a software dev this isn't muh baby, but salty peeps gonna be salty.

Anyway.  I'm really stoked to have this out in the world!

Palcoin is a Scot on Steem-Engine, powered by Nitrous and ScotBB (more info on that later today).  It's getting hot in here.  You should try it out!

https://www.palnet.io features a sweet claim drop that should be coming to users sometime this week.  Mining through PALM and PALMM on steem-engine.com.  There's a forum and a blogging site.  

Should be fun!
