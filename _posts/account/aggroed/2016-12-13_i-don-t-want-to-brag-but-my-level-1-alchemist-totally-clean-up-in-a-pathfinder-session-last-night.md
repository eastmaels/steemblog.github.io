<p>So, when I was a kid I played D&amp;D. &nbsp;I stopped for like 10-20 years because I became an adult and honestly at times felt too cool to roleplay despite playing shit like WOW for hours on end. &nbsp;Anyway(s) a friend of mine has been a hardcore gamer for years and kept talking about pathfinder. &nbsp;It's basically an opensourced D&amp;D 3.5 campaign, but they made national rules that everyone follows so it's easy to take a character from one gaming session to another.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I played my third campaign last night. &nbsp;After I got fired I decided to focus on the things that matter, like friend and family for a while. So, when my buddy told me to start playing again with him I finally said ok. &nbsp;So, not only did my alchemist gain a level, but it was a pretty fun experience to play with my friend and blow shit up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>First off there was a girl there! &nbsp;BOOM! &nbsp;She was kinda cute too. &nbsp;So, that had to be a sign from God. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Then I had to save the party a lot. &nbsp;The alchemist is a ranged touch attack splash damage character. &nbsp;Ranged means I can hit from far away. &nbsp;Touch means I can ignore armor, which makes it easier to hit. &nbsp;Splash means I hit the bad guy I was aiming at and all the monsters around him. &nbsp;Since it was a first level adventure I was gambling on undead. &nbsp;So I packed some holy water. &nbsp;I was dropping holy bombs all night blowing up 2d4+6 damage per round and barely missing since they are easy to hit. &nbsp;I dropped almost every single mob while my friends were fatigued or otherwise unable to do shit.<br>
<br>
So, I'm going to keep going. &nbsp;I've even come out of the closet here as an occasional D&amp;Der. &nbsp;I won't be ashamed anymore. &nbsp;To hell with all the haters. &nbsp;I got a PhD, I'm a nerd, I'm a dork, and I'm proud of my bomb dropping alchemist cleaning house.<br>
<br>
I haven't gone larping yet, but if I'm being brutally honest with myself it's in my future. &nbsp;Gotta wait for it to get warmer first.</p>
