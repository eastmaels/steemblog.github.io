Can you believe it?  It's Sunday already.  That means it's Minnow Mayor Town Hall time.  I'll be on the air with my favorite guest tonight:  YOU!!!.  That's right.  The format of the show is sticking around another week.  You're invited to come on the air with Witness 11 @aggroed turned College DJ throwback SkankyJ!

## General Rules <h2>

You can come on and talk about anything.
You can come on and promote anything.
You can come on and ask about anything.
You can come and just chill and we can have a conversation because you want to introduce yourself to the community.
It hasn't happened yet, but please don't come on and attack me.  You're welcome to ask hard questions on sensitive things, but keep in mind, I'm just a dude doing the best I can with the information I have available.  This gig is basically an impossible job where I have an internet's worth of people who want resources because they are all minnows, and we're operating in a resource constrained environment.  So, just take a breather, ask whatever you want, but please try to be civil when you do it.  This is "Do no harm, **but take no shit** land."  So far everyone has been respectful, but I'm pretty sure the day will come when someone comes for the jugular.  Please don't let it be you.
Basically, you'll get 5 min minimum and if we're talking about cool stuff I may extend it.


## Delegation <h2>

So, on the show I give away delegations.  Last week we rolled a 1 so the delegation pushed to this week.  So, we're going to do a 500 SP delegation tonight.  The only way to get a chance at the delegation is to come on air with me.  Then all the guests will go in a table and if I roll your number you'll get the delegation.  If I roll a 1 we'll push it to next week.  The delegation is meant for minnows.  You can keep the delegation until you hit 5k SP or six months go by.  If you're a dolphin or whale you're welcome to come on the air and we'd love to have you, but if you win the delegation you have to provide the name of a MSP community account or minnow that you want the delegation to go to in your name.

## Dice Bitches <h2>

I like Dice.  Depending on the flow of the show I'll get to a good spot and roll dem bones.
I roll the `t!dice 15d15` 
if you tie or beat me you can stay in for the next round.
I'll lower the roll for `t!dice 14d14` and so on until either I win or a member wins.
If I win once we'll start from scratch and everyone is welcome back into to roll starting from `t!dice 15d15`.  If I win twice I'll send the money to @msp-waves to help pay for the radio station.

## So you want to come on the show with me! <h2>
Make sure you have a headset and mic ready to go.  Try talking in one of the other voice channels to make sure that it's working and folks can hear you.
Understand I record all the interviews I can remember to record :)  So, if you're talking it'll probably show up on the block later.
Head into the PALnet Discord server: https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy
Join the mspwaves-audience Discord Channel.  Here's a Discord link to that: https://discord.gg/BS8WTzM
During the show I'll ask anyone that wants to come on the air with me to place a 1 in chat.  I'll go in order of who puts the 1 first.

## Show Sponsor <h2>
This show is brought to you in part by @lovejuice.  It's a bid bot that I run.  If you give it a small transfer of 0.1SBD or more it'll vote your posts somewhere between 1.2-2.0 in post rewards.  You can also work with @isaria and schedule yourself to post to the account.  We'll pay you 5SBD for your content.  If the post gets a whale vote we're happy to pay you higher.  You can write about basically anything that you want.  If you're already making 10 SBD on a post this is probably a bad idea.  If you only make a few pennies on a post this is a good way to get your voice out to a bunch of new people and get paid for your work.  If you don't like bid bots or the fact that the content is original but not all of it is produced by @aggroed then I suggest not using the service.  You're also welcome to flag, but that often comes with a lot of unintended consequences on the platform.

It's meant to be fun, helpful to minnows, rewarding to minnows, and a place to aggregate a little off-color posts.  Relax, we're just joking... unless you're gonna do it.
