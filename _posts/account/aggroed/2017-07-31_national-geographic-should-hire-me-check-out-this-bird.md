I went on a hike near my house.  Sat down at the peek and while having a popcorn snack the family realized we were a few feet from this bird.  It basically sat there unmoving while we had a popcorn break.  It gave us the stink eye the whole time.  I went to get the uber closeup.  Here is the result.

Side note all hell is breaking loose on the blockchain today.  Some notable flags I'll be mentioning soon.  Also a ton of technology failures that I can see the Devs working on and the witnesses talking about.  For some of the bot services they aren't going to be available because they rely on a a steem node that's down.  @minnowsupport is one example.  I'm assuming mercury is in retrograde.
