Mom heard my heart pour out and listened with timeless patience.
This month was horrible.  Wife, kids, job, and life in turmoil.  
Your granddaughter picked up a wild bunny in the back yard.   Today is the last day she's five.
If you could only meet her.  Smiles for miles.  Then tears.
I left flowers at her headstone.

Humiliation.  Unhorsed, unarmed, and defeated.  
The crowd cheered for him.  Count Drakos of Bastardia.
He came to end me, but I threw sand in his eyes.
Booing ensured... but I didn't care.  I wanted to win.
His sword up, but I stepped into it.  Took it!  I sliced him dead.
Renaissance Faire champion!
