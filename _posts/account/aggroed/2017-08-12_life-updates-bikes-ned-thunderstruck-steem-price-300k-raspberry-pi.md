Do you remember learning to ride a bike?  I have some recollection.  It seemed to take me days to do.  Part of that is that I lived on a huge hill.  I remember going all the way from my house to the bottom of the hill only to wipe out at the bottom.  I still have scars on my knees from it.  I remember my dad pushing me.  I remember my mom watching.  I remember it taking a while.

Yesterday my first one baby took off her training wheels and within 30 min had taught herself to ride her bike.  We had tried on a larger bike, but we got one that was a little small and off she went.  I've never seen someone pick up riding like that before.  It was a few little pushes and then off she went.  I tried learning to ride a recumbent bicycle and it took me longer to figure that out than it took her to ride this.

Just sharing a proud dad moment.  If you ever read this baby I hope you know how proud I am of you.  It's a joy to be your dad!

## Ned <h2>

Ned visited the witnesses in Steemit Chat a day or two ago.  I've been a witness for a few months now.  I think this is the first time I've seen him in there.  It's possible that some communication is happening over other channels, but I happen to prefer the public ones that everyone knows about.  So, first off, thanks Ned for communicating with us publicly with a method all the witnesses can get access to without difficulty.

Ned was there looking for folks to comment on the white paper.

There's been a lot of changes through hard forks so he's looking to update it.  You'll notice @smooth got to it pretty quickly and thoroughly.  I've been reading sections as I can, but this weekend I'll hopefully have some time to check it out.

While I had a chance to directly communicate with him I mentioned-
It's a pleasure to see him in the public channel.
@ausbitbank asked him about changes to this section of the whitepaper.
>In order to realign incentives and discourage individuals from simply voting for themselves, money must be distributed in a nonlinear manner.

He mentioned that flagging was simply a redistribution of the reward pool.  I said many recipients of those flags don't see it that way.

I invited him to speak to the ~5,000 person PALnet Discord community, but sadly he didn't respond to that.
I invited him to put in a request for the radio show I was running at the time for mspwaves.com/listen.  He picked ACDCs thunderstruck for muh 90s rock show.  Good pick.

You may be interested in the fact that Ned recently delegated out almost his entire stake.

## Steemit growth, but not mooning <h2>

The next two points seem related and currently not correlated.  Steem recently surpassed 300k accounts!

I've pulled this image from @elyaque's blog.  If you don't follow it you're missing out!

So, we've hit 300k accounts, but you may have noticed that Steem price continues to linger between $1.25-$1.33.

There have been concerns mentioned in several channels and posts that the change to linear rewards has increased collusion in votes, which have deterred investors from hopping into Steemit.  Hopefully linear rewards doesn't stick around forever.  It seems like a backdoor fix to the actual problem which is distribution on the platform.  In the meantime we'll have to rely on large SP holders to find and flag whale collusion.

## Time to learn to program <h2> 

Ok, so, lastly, I've wanted to learn to program forever, but I haven't had a project that has forced me to do it yet.  Steemit is that project, so I bought a Raspberry Pi.  I figure if I'm going to be a better witness to help Steemit grow I should learn to program.  So, I'm going to try to write a few basic programs to interact with Discord and the block.  We'll see what I can come up with, but that should keep me busy.  For now I have a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian loaded up and look forward to what may come.
