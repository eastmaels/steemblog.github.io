Hey Steemians.  I'm really excited to present to you the Top 20 Witness Forum recording.  This is from Saturday June 30th.  We have a good discussion with @andrarchy about what Steemit is putting together.  Sounds like we're getting really close on HF20 "Velocity."  That's a big deal as it's some of the key changes that have to take place for our block infrastructure to allow the other flashier updates.

Velocity won't be sexy.  You won't notice big changes as a user, but this is all about blockchain scalability.  These changes let us implement SMTs and Communities in a way that isn't possible with the current backend.

##  Developing on Steem

One thing that I'm growing in appreciation of is the ability of a web developer to act like a web developer and just use Steem.  What do I mean?  Well if you want to work with Ethereum you have to learn frameworks and smart contracts in order to participate in development.  If you want to work with Steem you just do the same things you've been doing for a long time.  You make API calls, but now you call a blockchain instead of a database.  Steem has bascially made it to the insanely difficult resource to find of blockchain developer isn't really necessary.  What you need is a web developer who understands that you can call the block like you would a database.  Now people that have been doing web development for the last 20 years can interact with us too.

## Anyway, the forum

We were able to have a good discussion of Steem and listen to the witnesses
