Steemit is a living, breathing, heart beating, crypto-DNA making machine.  It pulses every three seconds with a new beat and a new block added to the chain.   Your goal is to embed yourself somewhere in this community like a war reporter on the front lines, and tell your story of what's going on around you.  

Every little piece of this community needs a voice and hopefully by talking about it you can give it the life you think it deserves

## 4 steps  <h2>

Step 1.  Find something that really interests you.
Step 2.  Dive into the community
Step 3.  Figure out the root cause of a problem they are having
Step 3.  Talk about what's going on in that community from your perspective and try to fix the problem

## Let me give you an example <h2>

I don't think there are many people that know what's going on with minnows better than me.  I run a group that's just about to hit 2,200 people and almost all of them are minnows.  They come from all over the world.  They speak different languages.  There are some constants between them.  

They often felt lonely on steemit before the group existed.
Their content wasn't getting any play.
The spent hours on posts and the return was shit.
They tried other tactics but things didn't stick.
Post rewards are low.
10 Votes a day only at 100% hurts interactions.
Flagging abuse
Making connections
and a million newbie questions on what the hell is steemit and how does it work.

Half of the Minnow Support Project is about helping these people just through providing a space and half is about reporting on and working on solutions.

## Minnow pain is a loud pulse <h2>

I've had some really wonderful effect on helping minnows.  I've helped get minnows into trending, their posts in the hundreds, some of the minnow pond guys are breaking 1k followers now, and people feel fairly united.  I've worked my ass off and kept my ear to the ground for this community.  It's fun and it's also provided me with some fairly steady post rewards.  The purpose was good and it was addressing a serious pain in the community.  

If you're feeling frustrated or like something is really broken then try to network to find like minded people.  Report that news from the underground current to the folks that don't have it front and center.  My guess is that you'll start picking up followers that care about the same topics, many of them will be friends from that community whose opinions are shaping your own, and you'll see how you can grow.  Followers, resteems, friends, and upvotes should go up.

## Find your pulse and report <h2>

So, find a pain, get your finger on the pulse, try to solve a problem, and let us know what's going on.  If you're on the pulse you'll find a community that's willing to help you.  I'm sure of it, and if has to do with Minnows I know some people that will help.
