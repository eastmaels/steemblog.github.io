<p>Today's a special day. &nbsp;I have 200 followers. &nbsp;I thought I'd recap what I've done on here. &nbsp;Here's the rundown.</p>
<p>3 months</p>
<p>364 posts</p>
<p>200 followers</p>
<p>2800 Steem Power (I haven't purchased any with bitcoin)</p>
<p>upvotes from @sirwinchester, @stellabelle , @smooth, @jamesc, @dantheman, @berniesanders, @blocktrades, @rainman, @summon, @complexring, @wang, @nextgencrypto, @kalinart, @craig-grant, @dwinblood, @otisbrown, @lafona, @joseph</p>
<p>I have steady upvotes from @murh, @jlufer, and @skeptic (probably others but those sometimes get buried)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have made new friends in @canadian-coconut and @jamesc</p>
<p>I trolled an @ned post and got him to talk about what needs to be done to raise the price of steem</p>

<p>I was in a short flame war with @r4fken&nbsp;</p>
<p>I talked about my steemit posts and posted them on youtube. &nbsp;I've personally exposed steemit to a lot of people.</p>
<p>1.3M Youtube hits</p>
<p>3400 youtube followers</p>
<p>Total youtube watch time 10.6M minutes, which is 20 years of video watching.</p>
<p>54 videos</p>
<p>I've also learned a shit ton about blockchain that I never knew about. &nbsp;I like the transparency aspect of it. &nbsp;I still hate mining, and if nothing else the inflation is going to kill everyone, but the whales around here. That said the technology and approach itself is pretty cool.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I know I'm salty, and I continue to think that the price of steem is going to tank between the number sellers, the too few buyers, the ridiculous amount of inflation, and no way for institutional investors to put money in here. &nbsp;However, that beef is with the economics of the platform. &nbsp;The platform itself is pretty fucking cool. &nbsp;I like this place. &nbsp;I mostly like the community (even if I may not be loved in return). &nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So, here's to my 200 followers now, and may there be many more (hopefully some more that aren't a bunch of broke ass basement dwelling millenials with phat stacks of steem).</p>

<p>as always upvote, comment, resteem, and follow or the terrorists have won.</p>
