I had an hour long conversation with a guy by the name of Dylan Monroe last night.  I found him because he made a giant map of interconnecting secret societies and major events in history, it actually made it on a comedy central news show, but they modified it before posting it.  The fact that they modified pieces of it was really fascinating to me.  It's a subtle nod that this chart had information that was worth hiding and powerful enough that it was worth mocking.

Turns out Dylan likes Jordan Sather like I do. He's in a facebook group with him so I was able to track him down that way.  And we setup the fall listed above.

## Website

You can find his work [here](https://www.dylanlouismonroe.com/q-web.html)

Here's the mega map.  It's also available on the site.

## I'm not advocating that I believe everything on this.  There are some parts I don't know...

But I do think this map is an extraordinary cataloging of secret society mega events and covered up history.

## More to come

We spent an hour on the call and got about 1/6 of the way through the map on a fairly high level.  I imagine we'll speak more about this stuff over time, and I imagine I'll spend time talking about each and every one of the things listed on here over the coming weeks and years.


## We mention a Sephirot map.  Here's a link to that

## Reading the map is confusing.  Here's a guide to do it.
