The Peace Academy is designed to help Steemit and MSP community members learn to interact peacefully with one another and to demonstrate what that looks like when that is executed well. 

@aggroed and @isaria will also be discussing the concepts of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty and how we can best implement them here in our community, as well as in our daily lives.
