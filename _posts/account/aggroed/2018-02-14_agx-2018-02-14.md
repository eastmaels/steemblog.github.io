https://agx123.herokuapp.com//2018-02-14.jpg<br/><br/>This is the daily AgX chart for today 2018-02-14.<br/>Today's 200 day moving average is is 0.95 for a STEEM/SBD ratio of 0.83.<h3>What is AgX?</h3><br/><br/>The Mayer's multiple (200 days moving average of the BTC/USD price) is known to be a good indicator of the BTC price evolution.
AgX aims to be a similar indicator regarding the STEEM/SBD ratio, in order for users to find the right moment to exchange their SBD for STEEM at the best possible rate.

If the blue line is at the top of the chart it's a historically good time to sell steem for SBD.  If it's at the bottom of the chart it's a historically good time to sell sbd for Steem.  Just a data point, and the past doesn't ensure the future.
