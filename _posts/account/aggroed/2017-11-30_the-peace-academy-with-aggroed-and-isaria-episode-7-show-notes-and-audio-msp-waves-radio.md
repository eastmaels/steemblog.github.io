Our focus this week was conflict resolution and we used the heated topic of bid bots to provide examples of ineffective and effective methods of resolving conflict.


# <center> Show Highlights  </center>

* Aggroed explained how Hardfork 19 led to the rise of bid bots.
* We discussed the pros and cons of bid bots.
* We had some mock conversations that provided examples of both unproductive and effective forms of heated discourse.
* We discussed the best methods for conflict resolution.
* We did our best to trigger @isaria, @swelker101, and even @kubbyelizabeth.  You'll laugh :)
