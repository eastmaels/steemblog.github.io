Hey folks.  It's Sunday night again, and that means it's time for my talk show.  It's the standard format.  People come on, we do the talky talky, and then new people come on.  Should be fun.  This week I'm hoping to catch Teamsteem for an extra long interview as we figure out how to be successful on Steem, what the future holds for crypto, and how the world will change once crypto is embraced everywhere.

## Logistics <h2>

Show starts in 20 min from when this post went live!
Hop into the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network, which is a the Discord home of the Minnow Support Project and our main touch point for msp-waves broadcasts](minnowpond.org).

If you'd like to be on the show make sure you have a working mic, hang out in the waiting room and get mic checked, and then come speak to me.  You can talk about anything you want, just don't purposefully be an aggressive asshole about anything and we're gonna be cool.

## Delegation <h2>

Still holding off on delegations for a bit.  I'll finish a delegation pledge to msp-curation this week, give a little love to patrice and her anti-spam bots, and then work on a msp-waves-audience bot that will reward users that come listen to shows frequently.

## Dice Bitches <h2>

That's right!  We're rolling them bones.  25 steem is up for grabs this week.  I'm gonna do 15 as a dice bitches roll and then 10 to the highest roller in a single round.  If I win dice bitches money goes to msp-waves.
