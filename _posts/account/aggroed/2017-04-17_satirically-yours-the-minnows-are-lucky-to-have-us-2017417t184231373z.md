@aggroed is live on the scene trying to cover many aspects of the ongoing debate over hard fork 19.  Essentially the steemit community is attempting to change the rewards system so poorer members can have more say.  Satirically Yours was able to catch up with Steemit Whale Steeman Buffet.  Let's see what he has to say.

Buffet- you see sir, ultimately without the rich there would even be a poor.  Frankly  they wouldn't have anything.  It's like we constantly try to find way to give them some steem, but they simply can't figure it out?

Aggroed-  well what do you suggest?  

Buffet-  well obviously this place works by getting other rich streamers to back you.   What I suggest is to be rich and gain friends.  It's as simple as that.  Then you can go on writing about antelopes and find yourself with $1000 steem dollars.

Aggroed-  well economics in this country are pretty tight as it is.  Most families don't have $500 to spare let alone be able to place $100k into steem in order to have any real kind of pull around here.

Buffet-  dear boy:  that sounds dreadful.  How do minnows like you live like that?  It sounds miserable.  Look it does sound awfully terrible that you don't have any money but that's not my problem.  The value of this place isn't t determined by the poor so much as by the presence of the wealthy.  That's why we set steemit up from the very beginning such that about 30 of us own about 90% of the wealth of this thing.  

Aggroed-  right, of course it makes sense that investors and inventors should be rewarded, but I think some of the out pouring of frustration is over the fact that with a purpose of creating a libertarian leaning website that is meant to undermine the power of the fed and give humanity hope of another coin option the creators found a way to be less egalitarian than even the fed.  Is there another way that you could envision making this place more egalitarian that doesn't involve a minor tweak to the back end of the rewards system?

Buffet-  dear boy.  That is exactly the plan.  We don't want to upset the central distribution it benefits us too much.  We want to give the minimum required to make this whole thing go away.  Doesn't that sound like a better option?  What do you want to see happen?  Steemit opens the floodgates on the @steemit account? Liquidates everything?  Drives the price down cheap enough so the poorest amount is might actually have a stake in this place?  It sounds like a bloody shit show for the investors.  Where do socialist fools like you come from?  It's that sanders crowd I'm guessing.  

At this point he walked away.  @aggroed will attempt to find other views regarding the hard fork 19 debate.
