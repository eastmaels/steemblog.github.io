Hey Steemians.  I know there are lots of folks concerned about bid bots and how curation works on the platform.  I put together a meeting of bid bot owners and the general public to talk about ways bid bot owners can improve transparency, ways to better serve the community, and some programming changes that we can enact to make the system work better for all involved.

Here's the recording (my audio is a little harsh throughout, sorry about that, it does get a little better at the 1 min mark).

On a side note, my bid bot experiment is going well.  Some of the things that I've started to figure out include:

- make sure you don't bid after 5 days.  You can technically do it, but there's a chance on a 6 day old post if you're not paying attention you may end up missing your bid window which exposes you to non-refunds and may hurt the bid bot owners.

- Using bid bots can net you a profit, but it does absorb liquid funds and put your earnings into steem power.  So, if you're hoping to keep your liquid funds this path will actually drain them.

-  Posts with higher post rewards tend to get more views.  So, it would appear that posts that have purchased a large vote end up getting more views on the platform.

- Spreading curation rewards after a post feels good.

-  Using the bid bots at the front of a post feels good too because it's driving up attention to the post at the start of it.

Random side note.  Today is the day I'm switching over my proxy.  I've issued many notices on my blog, radio shows, and Discord over the last month.  There will be an opportunity in a month to get the vote for those that want it.
