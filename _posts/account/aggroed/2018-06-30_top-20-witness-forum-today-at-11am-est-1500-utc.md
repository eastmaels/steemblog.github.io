Please join me today for the Top 20 Witness Forum.  I know it's July 4th weekend and the Americans are getting ready to grill and chill, but this is an important milestone.  Looks like Hardfork 20, entitled Velocity, is getting closer to being reality.  We'll get some insight from Andrarchy for what this means for Steem as a code change and we'll be sure to talk about what this means for the community.  Personally I think it's a pretty big step towards mass adoption and the wait appears to be over.

## What's next?

The witnesses are pretty well aligned with Steemit's goals now.  There isn't much argument against working on Velocity, Communities, and SMTs.  I've heard and seen very little conversation around what those will do to the ecosystem, and then what will we need to work on after those changes are implemented.  I'm hoping that the witnesses today bring their crystal balls and are prepared to think about the chain six months from now and what's going to be necessary.  Of course we'll talk about what we're working on today, but I'm just as excited about how our current plans will impact the future.

## Logistics

Show starts at 11am EST.
You can listen at mspwaves.com
or in the Minnow Support Project at minnowpond.org 

There is an audio room and a chat room.  Please join us there.

I'll start spinning some 90s rock around 10:30am EST.  We'll go until around 1pm EST.,

Andrachy will kick us off for 30-45 min, and then witnesses can share what they are working on and what's the priority for the block once these next changes are done.


## Witnesses

Witnesses are two things.  A witness is a server that creates the blockchain.  A witness is a person who operates the server.  The top 20 decide what hardforks are accepted, and thus how the blockchain code can be changed.  Witnesses are often either providing code or building community to add value to the Steem ecosystem.
