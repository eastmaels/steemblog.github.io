I posted a contest two days ago for the delegation of my steem power I receive as a witness.  250 was to go to a mod.  100 was to go to a bot.  @sammosk won both.  His account received the most votes with 9 votes out of 40 cast choosing him personally to receive the delegation.  His bot was actually in a 3-way tie with @discordia and @msp-shanehug.  I decided to cast the deciding vote.  Discordia is a bid bot so it has plenty.  I already delegate 500 to shanehug for my awkwardly long and semi-inappropriate hugs which I love so much.  So, @msp-creativebot wins the day.

## Big congrats to @sammosk <h2>

MSP loves you (and all of the moderators) as well as your bot (like we do all the bots), but today was your day.  

Bigger upgoats to you and yours!
