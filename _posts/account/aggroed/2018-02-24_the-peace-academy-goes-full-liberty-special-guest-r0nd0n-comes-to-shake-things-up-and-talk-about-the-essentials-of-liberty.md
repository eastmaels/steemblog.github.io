@isaria is on a weekend retreat for part of this weekend and has left me all alone to fend for myself on the Peace Academy.  Well, we're reworking the Peace Academy for an episode.  We're gonna touch on free range, home schooled, rural recreational nuclear land mine homesteading.  That's our starting point!  We're going full Liberty today and I hope you come emotionally prepared for this baby!  

I've invited my friend, radio tech master, and Minnow Support Project Sr. Moderator @r0nd0n onto the show.  Together we'll really touch on the aspects of Liberty, what it means, how to live by it, what standards to hold to it, and how to be and live free.
