# Rules of Fair Fighting Part 1

Having some rules and guidelines can help us to be fair when trying to resolve conflict in a peaceful manner.

 

### Listen and Don’t Interrupt
This is often difficult to do when we are feeling upset and heated.
Using a timer can help.  Take turns speaking and allow 1 or 2 minutes for each person to have their say.
Do your best to really listen to the other person instead of just thinking about what you want to say next!

### No Yelling
Yelling only escalates the situation. Yelling over each other accomplishes nothing as neither person is actually listening to one another.  If only one person is yelling then the person on the receiving end will only respond in a defensive manner.  The goal in conflict resolution is de-escalation. If you find your anger reaching levels where yelling could be a result then it’s time to take a break and cool off!

### No Insults 
Degrading language is disrespectful and will only escalate the situation. Insults lead to both parties attacking each other’s character instead of actually working on resolving the issue. Focus on discussing the issue instead of attacking the person.


### Examine and Resolve One Issue at a Time
Sometimes conflicts get out of control and you end up arguing about everything that someone has ever done wrong!
Other times there may actually be multiple issues that need to be dealt with.
Either way, it’s important to focus on one issue at a time and work on resolving it before moving on to the next issue.


### Don’t Engage in Stonewalling
Taking a break to cool down is a good technique, but don’t shut down and refuse to communicate altogether out of anger.
Stonewalling is purposely refusing to speak as a way to hurt the other person.  It only makes things worse and causes whatever issues that need to be worked on harder to resolve in the long run.
