We're going to have a top 20 witness forum tomorrow.  It'll start at 11am EST as per usual that's 1500 UTC.  We're stoked to have @andrarchy who is the Director of Content for Steem joining us.  His team is getting high praise for putting out a lot of good posts and keeping the community better informed these days through @steemitblog.  There's a fair amount to talk through there and I expect the first 30-45 minutes will be Steemit centered.

After that we'll have the Witness forum.  Witnesses are free to talk about their projects, what's going well, what concerns they have, and my primary concern is what direction should we start looking after March of 2019 when SMTs hit.

We'll be joined by @timcliff, @aggroed, @pgarcgo, @drakos, and @elear.

@timcliff is known for his help on steem.chat, and his recent work adding to the blockchain code!
@aggroed is founder of the Minnow Support Project, msp-waves, and Steem Monsters.
@pgarcgo is founder of Cervantes the leading Spanish community.
@drakos is a constant help on Steem.chat and a Witness leading the Minnow Support Community.
@elear is the founder of Utopian-io a project dedicated to spreading and supporting open source development.


## Logistics

You can find us in the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord channel home of the Minnow Support Project and msp-waves.  An easy link is minnowpond.org.

There are voice and chat rooms in there for the live shows.

You can listen in at mspwaves.com/listen.

If you're a guest please show up a little early to get sound checked.  I'm normally online around 10:30 spinning some tunes from the 90s (maybe I'll play 2 princes this week...).  

If you're a guest in the audience all questions in good taste are welcome.  It's a liberty group so you can say what you need to, but it's a peace group so you're welcome to comment negatively on behavior but not on people themselves.
