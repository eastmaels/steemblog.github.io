Minnow Support Project

>"Give a minnow an upvote and they'll eat for a day. Give a minnow a resteem and they'll eat forever."
Ancient Steemit Proverb

Hello Minnows!
I recently hit 1,500 followers and broke into the top 80 authors on Steemit. It had a lot to do with @kaylinart and @fyrstikken resteeming one of my posts.   It got me thinking...

What if I could help my followers like @kaylinart and @fyrstikken helped me!?! It's pretty easy to do. All I have to do is resteem my followers! What if I could get them a reward too!?!  And the Minnow Support Project was born!

Now that Minnow Support Project has grown we have our own account @minnowsupport and our own Discord server https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw.  The Discord server room is called the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network or PALnet or PAL for shot.  There's 150 people in there already and we've only been active for 1 night!  It's a great start.

Great work by @justcallmemyth (Graphic Designer!  Send him your business!)

## Announcement <h2>
Hopefully you saw the announcement that this project is giving away a free all expense paid trip to STEEMFEST to a minnow!  That project goes contest goes live next week at 7am NYC time.  So, make sure you have posts prepared over the weekend and can link them early.

Also, I'm transitioning this contest away from my @aggroed account and over to @minnowsupport.  So, if you want to continue getting this contest you have to follow @minnowsupport.  I'll announce the free trip through @aggroed next week, but my plan is to have the 2nd round and contest winners will be announced through @minnowsupport.

Looks like @doitvoluntarily, @ausbitbank, me, and possibley @roelandp may be judges!  (Still waiting to hear from @fyrstikken and @kaylinart)

## What are the rules to the resteem contest? <h2>
For every 100 upvotes I'll resteem a follower's post (have to follow @minnowsupport)
To be able to get a resteem simply link your post (or a referral if you want) in the comments section. Make sure there are at least 3 days left on the post rewards because I'm not going to resteem until Thursday.
The first resteem is the post that gets the most upvotes.
The second resteem is the post I think is best based on a criteria of promoting Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.
Third and up are based on upvotes as well.
Getting upvoted by bots doesn't count.
Winners will get all liquid post rewards from this contest!
You'll get resteems from @aggroed and @minnowsupport!

## What counts as a minnow? <h2>
If you have less than 500 followers and have earned less than 5,000SP at the time you post then you're a minnow that's eligible for the resteem and the reward!  

## Who won last week’s contest?” <h2>
