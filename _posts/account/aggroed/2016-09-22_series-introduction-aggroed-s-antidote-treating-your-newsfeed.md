<p>One of the problems I had while I was still asleep and a sheep was my news feed. &nbsp;I watched mainstream media. &nbsp;I trusted my government. &nbsp;I thought wars in other countries were meant to keep me safe. &nbsp;I thought paying taxes was patriotic. &nbsp;I was proud and arrogant. &nbsp;I was also wrong.</p>
<p>I'm not sure my values have changed all that much. &nbsp;I want freedom. &nbsp;I want peace. &nbsp;I want abundance. &nbsp;I want people to go about their lives and working together to make awesome and wonderful things happen. &nbsp;I think people have the right to defend themselves. &nbsp;Those kinds of things haven't changed all that much. &nbsp;What did change was my perspective that the government was lying to me about their actions. &nbsp;They would say something that resonated, but then do the exact opposite. &nbsp;I thought the media would be there to expose those shenanigans, but instead they mostly came to their defense or just glossed over it.</p>
<p>Several times now I've created Facebook profiles with 1000s of people as friends. &nbsp;I've found groups over the years that I trust to deliver news stories that I think are more representative of the truth than what the mainstream has to offer. &nbsp;I think if other people had this same news feed that their perspectives might change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I like to blog a lot. &nbsp;It's pretty fun. &nbsp;This may just be news stories I curate and post. &nbsp;I might also do a voice over of the stories and give a little analysis. &nbsp;I don't know yet. &nbsp;I'm just starting this, but I wanted people to know that I'm going to try to cover real news and fake news. &nbsp;Hopefully someone will get something helpful out of it.</p>
<p>I'm calling the series Aggroed's Antidote, treating your newsfeed. &nbsp;It's meant to imply that your news feed is poisoned and here is a feed that might give you some truth or at least another perspective that you aren't hearing.</p>
<p>The series will cover things that I find interesting, which includes science, health, financial well being, politics, violence, freedom, government corruption, systematic deceit, and the occasional spiritual thoughts. &nbsp;I hope you enjoy.</p>
