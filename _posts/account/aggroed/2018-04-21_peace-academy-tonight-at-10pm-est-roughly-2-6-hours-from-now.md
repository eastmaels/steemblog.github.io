Hey all, proudly announcing the next episode of the Peace Academy hosted by me and @isaria!  Tonight is abundance night!  We'll be joined by @zipporah on air as a guest gost!

---

The ideals of the Minnow Support Project and its Discord are Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  We do not condone War or any use of violence to settle conflicts.

We'll be addressing some thoughts on abundance, and in this case go through some of what it takes to be successful on Steem.

---

**_We also want to hear from you!_**

Be sure to join the audience chat during the show and let us know if you want to come on air with us!  
As long as what you have to say is about Peace, Abundance, or Liberty it's fair game!
