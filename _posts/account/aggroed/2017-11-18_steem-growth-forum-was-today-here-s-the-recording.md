The Steem Growth Forum took place today and was a smashing success.  We had roughly a 2.5hr conference with 90+ people live in the audience and over 20 on air!  We had minnows, whales, witnesses, business owners, and a ton of good ideas.  I think many folks felt good to be in a community and possibly a little less isolated by being a part of Discord.  So, hopefully the folks that came on the show aren't strangers to the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network in Discord.  Hopefully y'all come back again!  

Here's a list of who came on air.

## Part II <h2>

I loved hosting this.  I'll work on some other forums for the community on our streaming internet station mspwaves.com.  Thanks for attending, thanks for speaking, and thanks for helping the Steem ecosystem to grow!

## inviteafriend <h2>

Just want to add one of my favorite little bits of this that came out today was a simple to implement idea.  inviteafriend as a tag so that as you bring folks onto the platform and get paid for it.  This is a no brainer.  Hopefully whales will support the folks that dot he missionary work to invite our friends and family from the terrestial world to our Steem family.  Here's some leadership on how to do it, hopefully the whales and the many collective accounts follow up with some incentive.

## Thanks for riding the waves with mspwaves radio.  If you liked the Forum please consider delegating to @msp-waves and upvoting my witness! <h2>
