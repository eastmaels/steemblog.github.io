Ok, well, for the sake of argument let's say that your salary is 100,000/yr for a nice round number.  Let's break this down by week.  So, instead of making 100,000/yr you make 1923/week. 

We can base this on my account for this next part.  I'm a dolphin with 1k followers and just a hair shy of 10kSP.  Right now let's say that my average post is around $30 USD and steem is $1/steem.  Assuming I did this full time maybe I could crank out 4-5 posts a day, for 6 days a week.  We'll call that 25 posts a week.  

25*30 is $750.

So, if steem gets up to $2.50 you could possibly think about shredding your contract and simply writing full time.

Now, not everyone can do that yet.  If you're just starting out reading something like this you may be thinking "wtf aggroed?"

I remember writing a post about Charlie Shrem when he was talking about how he could completely live off of steem while my posts were making $0.07.  I was frustrated by that.  So, hopefully I'm not comin' off like that.  I just want you guys to get a sense of what kinda number we're talking about in order for you to live ok, not work an office job, and just blog.  Seems like the two main things are price per steem, salary per week, and payout per post.

## Don't forget the tax man <h2>

Another thing to consider is taxes.  Because people that make 100,000 per year don't actually make that much.  The government comes and takes away those earning and threatens violence if you don't let them.  But assuming you're not reporting your steem as income because you're not converting into USD and they aren't looking the it's not quite as bad.

1923- 40%(1923) = $1158/wk. 

If that's the case then if the price of steem doubles to $2 and one chooses not to disclose said wages then you're there!

IDK... just thinking about numbers.  How much would you have to earn with steem before you'd quit what you're doing?
