<p>Or do you still need social permission to start asking questions? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I pulled back the veil and from my perspective see behind a lot of lies and think it's time to increase the range of things people can talk about. &nbsp;We're not supposed to talk about religion, politics, and money. &nbsp;They are foundational to our existence. &nbsp;The fact that it's considered rude or impolite to have these discussions except with people that already agree with us isn't a mark of progress in society, but a measure of the degree to which we've been programmed to only allow a certain level of discussion so as not to disrupt the current hierarchy of ideas and people.</p>
<p>So, let's look at a glaring example that is just a little old that shows us the media and everyone else lied to us. &nbsp;How about the Iraq war? &nbsp;"The oil will pay for the war!" &nbsp;"They have weapons of mass destruction." &nbsp;"They are associated with 9/11." &nbsp;A million other bullshit lies came out, and the vast majority of the American people, myself included, believed them. And because of this false narrative they were able to mobilize America into a giant war that has killed at least a million people and cost us trillions. &nbsp;So, now I'm done trusting this narrative and all the other narratives that have been fed to me. &nbsp;I'm not going to believe them without a really fucking detailed list of evidence that Russia hacked our elections. &nbsp;I need way more proof for everything they say going forward because these fuckers in power are pathological liars.</p>
<p>I'm going to list some things that are out there that people accept as true and the media portrays as true, but I'm either questioning or believe are outright lies at this point.</p>

<p>(full belief in the unofficial*)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Those aren't even really the woo-woo ones. &nbsp;What about the history surrounding the holocaust? &nbsp;What about American involvement in other government coups? &nbsp;What about aliens? &nbsp;What about Hollow Earth? &nbsp;What was the civil war actually about? &nbsp;If there wasn't a quorum after the civil war how did the government function? &nbsp;What happened to the US after the British burned down DC? &nbsp;What about Flat Earth? &nbsp;What does CERN do? &nbsp;Is the USG actually a corporation masquerading as a republic? &nbsp;I'm not ready to say that I firmly know what the truth behind these stories lines are, but if the USG says it's A then the one thing I'm sure about is that A is filled with lies. &nbsp;It's time to question everything we think we know. &nbsp;Burn it down and bring it back up.</p>
