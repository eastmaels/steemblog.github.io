Ok, there's so much blood in the streets it's amazing.  BTC took a nose dive.  Fundamentals didn't change in the last 2 weeks.  Sentiment did, but btc is getting a ton of new users from this.  People that wished they had invested at the lows are coming in.

# What are you supposed to do when price is low?

I wrote two posts already about what I think you should do.  This time I'll just ask some questions.  Fill in the blank "___ low ____ high"

These prices are fantastic!  Can they go down?  Yes!  But each time they go down what do you think happens to the probability that we've hit bottom?

When this market bottoms out then what will happen?  When the fear turns to greed.  When the big boys see epic lows.  What do you think they will do?

## Is crypto dead?

Did everyone stop posting on Steem?  Did people stop playing the games?  Did all the projects suddenly halt?  No?  Well why not?

Crypto is the future of practically all data.  Public, verified, trustless, transparent.  This is the future.  The last 50 years has been all about the transfer of data on the large economic scale.  We're gonna blast that open.

## So, bring on the lows

The sooner we bottom the sooner this biatch starts climbing again.  Be thrilled.  Think about whether this is the right time to be buying or selling.  To be divesting or accumulating.  Make up your mind on that, and then act accordingly.

Personally, I've loaded up on some Steem.  More is coming.  I'll tell ya.  It's fun, and I don't think there's going to be a better opportunity than this chunk of time right now for another year or more.

Stay frosty.  Have fun!

due your own due diligence bitches
