This is meme the news.  At the end of this meme the news is an extremly disturbing image of what some Palestinians experience.  Most of this is pretty traditional meme the news.  It's memes that are anti-war, anti-poverty, and anti-spy network.  Sometimes that makes you go deep in thought or I have to put some shit out that's salty.  This one is different. 
 It's disturbing.  So, this one comes with a warning.  You've been warned.  The bottom of this is 100% not safe for work, safe for kids nearby, safe for anyone involved, and may haunt you later.

War is disgusting.  Occupations are disgusting.  Human trafficking is disgusting.  We have a moral obligation to stop it and I include this image because until you realize just how fucked up the world is it's not going to capture your attention enough to know internally it all has to change.

With that trigger/image warning I now present- Meme the News
