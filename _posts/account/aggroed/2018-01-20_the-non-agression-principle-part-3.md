# 3 Basic Truths

In order to understand the foundations of the Non-Agression Principle, we can look at 3 basic truths.


**1. We exist**

**2. Self-Ownership**
We are responsible and in control of the movements of our own bodies, therefore we are the owners of our bodies.

**3. We must be free in order to survive, fully live, and thrive**
* We must have the freedom of movement to obtain sustenance
* We must have the freedom of choice so that we are not slaves
* We must have the freedom for self-actualization in order to thrive



These 3 basic truths are the foundations for individual freedom, personal responsibility, and defense against acts of aggression.


# Empathy and War


Something that I find disturbing is the way the general population seems to be accepting and detached when it comes to war, and I find the reason why to be even more disturbing.

With the exception of psychopaths and sociopaths, we all have some amount of empathy within us.
On a deeper level, we know that we are all the same….we are all just human.
It doesn’t matter what country you are from or what religion you are. 

We are all human.
This is the common thread that holds us all together.

Most of us absolutely find murder and killing horrible, sickening and absolutely unacceptable, so why is our reaction different when it comes to war?

The answer is a systematic desensitization by the Government who uses fear, propaganda, paranoia, and anger to dehumanize others and aggressively erase our empathy when it comes to how we view others.

They do this starting from childhood by teaching us that our country is the best and we are better than others, instilling a strong sense of nationalism and allegiance within us so that acts of war seem necessary, normal, and just.  As I've stated before the modern education system in America is a weapon of mass destruction.  I'm not anti-education... that's empowering, but a system that teaches us "the other" is always an existential threat worthy of harm is a dangerous force.
