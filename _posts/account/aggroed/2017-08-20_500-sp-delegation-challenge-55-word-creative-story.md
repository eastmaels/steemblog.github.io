I'm awarding the last delegation challenge to Rhondak and jasonbu.  It's a tough call because they were up against illuminatus and ajala.  Both stories are quite compelling.  Both stories got a fair amount of votes, and both had communities behind them.  I want to see the African and Nigerian communities taking off.  I want to see the fiction writers work getting out there.  It's a difficult decision.  Ultimately I decided to look at level of communication within PALnet as the decider.

So, congrats Rho and Jason.  You two are each getting 250 Steem Delegating to you.

## Next Challenge <h2>

55 word story fiction writing contest.  Needs a beginning, a middle, and and end.  Has to have a hook.  If you can work crypto anything into the story you'll get a bonus in the scoring.  Basic rules are I will narrow down my plan to the top 2-3 posts by vote count and vote total.  Then I'll look at them.  The winner will be the one that has the coolest concept, biggest twist, or if one mentions cryptos and the others don't.  In the event of a tie winner goes to the more active member of the PAL Discord community.

You can make a post adn link to the comments or you can type your story in there directly.
