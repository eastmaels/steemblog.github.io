The new baby has made me put this off for a few weeks, but now we're back!  Tomorrow at 10am we'll have a Steem Witness Forum in the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel, which you can visit at minnowpond.org.

The goal of the Minnow Support Project is to serve as a community gathering hub where Steemians across the world can gather together and discuss anything from getting started on the platform to what the Witnesses are working on to make this place better for everyone.

Please come join us tomorrow at 10am EST (1500 UTC) where top 20 witnesses will discuss some of the ongoing challenges the bear market means for the Steem ecosystem and we'll get some ideas of what we as a community can do to help this place survive and thrive.

## If you're a witness please bring a headset and have a working mic.  It's best to show up 5-10 minutes early.

Lastly, we're a Liberty group so we welcome any and all topics for discussion, but it's also a peace group so do your best to civil especially in tough times.

Hope to see you there!
