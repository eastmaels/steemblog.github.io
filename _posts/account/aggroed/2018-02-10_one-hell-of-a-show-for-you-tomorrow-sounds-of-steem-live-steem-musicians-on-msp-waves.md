I'm really stoked to present to you a fabulous lineup for tomorrow of Steem musicians!  I asked @krystle and @isaria for help and boy they did not let me down!  We have an international array of singers, songwriters, and world class talent!

## Performing Tomorrow! <h2>

@benleemusic

## Like I said we have a ton of talent coming!!! <h2>

Here's the thing.  If we want the value of Steem to go up we have to get more people on the platform.  One of the best ways to do this is to build communities and support those communities.  We have a vibrant musical assortment on Steemit and as a witness I can support our homegrown talent by hosting the event.  You can support them by showing up and interacting with your favorites!  So, please bring a blanket, a swivel chair, a picnic with some food to share, and come hang out with us tomorrow!

## Logistics <h2>

Show starts tomorrow, Saturday Feb 10th, at 11am EST (1600 UTC).
