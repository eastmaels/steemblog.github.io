Hey Folks, well it's that time for an another show promo post.  This week I got two parts of the evening lined up.

## PALnet Orientation <h2>

So, when I first started the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord room I setup an orientation to tell people about it.  We got a few dozen people in that meeting and some of them are not only still a part of the Minnow Support Project but now active leaders and a few Steemit witnesses too.  As part of the goal of hitting 6k active members in the Discord Community I want host orientations to help folks get acquainted.  Some folks have never been in a chat room before and some folks have never been in Discord before.  It honestly can be overwhelming and I wanted to break down that barrier by personal welcoming people and giving them an orientation to our digital home. 

Join us tonight in 3 hrs from 8-9 EST (NYC time, it's 5pm at the time of this post launch).  I'll be there to introduce you to new people.  Help you make some friends.  Find some stuff that interests you, and help you grow a community around you, which is the number 1 thing you need on the platfrom to be successful if you're not already rich or famous.

PALnet Discord: https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy

We'll be in general voice channel, which you can find here.  https://discord.gg/PpxP8u5  If you feel at all comfortable doing it please try to setup "Push to Talk" before the orientation starts.  You can find the icon for settings as the cog in the lower left right next to where you enter text, and head down to Voice, and click on the button mid screen that says "Push to Talk."

We'll be in the text room at the top of the list called "Orientation."  You can find the link here: https://discord.gg/EKvAjz8

## Minnow Mayor Town Hall <h2>

As per the updated and now usual format I'll be hosting YOU on the show tonight!  You're welcome to come with anything you'd like to promote.  You can ask me anything you want.  I will continue to ask that you don't come on air simply to attack me, but you're welcome to ask challenging questions and I'll answer them to the best of my ability.

If you want to go on air simply join the voice chat "waiting room."  You have to have headphones, a working mic, and you have to turn the show way down or off entirely or else the feedback will wreck the interview.  I'm going to record them and post them later.

## Delegation 250 SP <h2>

Anyone that comes on the air is eligible for a 250 SP delegation from me.  These delegations aren't normal.  They aren't short term leases like minnowbooster.  I plan to leave them on until you hit 5k sp and are no longer a minnow.  Then I'll move them along to someone else.  it make stick around for a few months, and effectively be worth $100 or so.  If you're a dolphin you're welcome to appoint someone to receive the delegation if you come on the air.  I roll for who gets it, on a roll of a one the delegation gets added to next week's total.

## Dice Bitches <h2>

We play dice during the show.  Use the `t!dice 15d15' command`  If your roll ties or is higher than mine you can stick around for the next round.  The next round is 14d14 and we keep shrinking to help keep track.
If I win the game we start over from the begnning and everyone that was knocked out can come back and play again.
If I win the game two times in a row I send the 25sbd to @msp-waves to help pay the operations costs of running the station.
