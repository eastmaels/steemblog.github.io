<p>Yes, that's right! &nbsp;Ladies and Gentleman step right up and hear this amazing tale of how I was able to earn $0.07 in just 5 blog posts yesterday. &nbsp;You may want to call your friends to gather around to hear this tale as well because with results like these everyone will copy this plan!!!</p>

<p>That's right. &nbsp;First off, and most importantly I don't know any of the whales nor have any connection to them. &nbsp;That's right, by living a whale free existence on here I'm basically ensured to never earn a cent by posting here. &nbsp;You call them whales, I call them <strong>Steemit oligarchs</strong>, and without one of them deeming your content any good you'll likely never get a taste of being in the money! &nbsp;Just like in the real world your opinion isn't worth shit unless someone with money supports it! &nbsp;By embracing this concept soon you can live like me!</p>

<p>Now, once you've ruled out having a connection to the 0.1% of Steemit participants that control 90% of the Steem power and Steem dollars we're off to the minnows. &nbsp;That's right, but don't worry, I have an absolute plan that will be sure to drive them all away! &nbsp;That's right, I talk about <strong>uncomfortable subjects</strong>. &nbsp;Despite evidence that as high as 25% of Americans consider themselves conspiracy theorists these subjects are still taboo! &nbsp;By talking about them and having a system that publicly records who likes the posts people are nervous to approve the content for fear they will be socially ostracized for sharing unsanctioned opinions!</p>
<p>9/11, vaccines, occultism, and the Mandela Effect are sure to make sure that no one reads your posts and you are guaranteed fractions of a return on your time investment. &nbsp;With this kind of money you can buy soap at Walmart when there are absurd specials going on or penny candies!</p>

Yes, with this kind of money you too could have SEVEN count them SEVEN of the candies above, but WAIT! &nbsp;THAT'S NOT ALL!!!</p>
<p>Yes, the final step of alienating just about everyone on the server is to complain about the policies of the server. &nbsp;That's right, don't call them whales, that's too cute! &nbsp;CALL THEM STEEMIT OLIGARCHS! &nbsp;That way the 0.01% are sure never to read your content and if by chance they do, you'll be sure to piss them off enough never to upvote it. &nbsp;Be sure to talk about how the execution on the white paper has led to an absurd case where 98% of the content is written by people that receive almost no reward. &nbsp;You might even say it's a GIANT PONZI SCHEME!</p>

<p>You might think that's enough, but why stop there! &nbsp;If you ACT NOW you can insult the people with power that might not like your critique. &nbsp;Call them STEEMSTERS and make a douchy meme about them slandering your content and telling you to piss off back to Facebook-omalia!</p>
<p><img src="https://s22.postimg.org/lt4eyrha9/hipster_on_tablet_meme.jpg" width="850" height="476"/></p>
<p>With that final move completed you are virtually ensured to never earn above $0.07 on all your posts for a day! &nbsp;Congratulations. &nbsp;You have succeeded at free blogging and can live out your (impoverished) dreams!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You're welcome!</p>
