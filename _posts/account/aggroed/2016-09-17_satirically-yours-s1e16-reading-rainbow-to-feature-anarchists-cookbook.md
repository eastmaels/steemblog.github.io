<p>In a surprise announcement Reading Rainbow is choosing to feature "The Anarchists Cookbook" on a new episode of the show. &nbsp;LeVar Burton announced this to his <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/readingrainbow/bring-reading-rainbow-back-for-every-child-everywh/posts/1573309">kickstarter page</a> surprising some, delighting others, and infuriating more than a few.</p>

<p><img src="https://maas.museum/app/uploads/sites/4/2015/12/CookbookCover-1024x717.jpg" width="1024" height="717"/>Micheal Ferretti, local superintendent of schools in Dearborn Michigan shares some of his concerns-</p>
<p>"I think this is a travesty of epic proportions. &nbsp;Reading rainbow is a classic program to help young children learn to read, especially with violence where it is in this country it makes no sense for them to do this. &nbsp;Our classrooms are already overcrowded and parts of this community are intolerant. &nbsp;How will teaching them them tools of violence improve anything?"</p>

<p>Others are a little less certain however. &nbsp;Three blocks down the street local protesters gathered in a daytime vigil to protest another killing of an unarmed child. &nbsp;Police say they feared for their lives when they saw the toddler with a bottle of soap in his hands while the back of his wheelchair faced the cops. &nbsp;Terror filled their hearts and they had no choice but to shoot the child 39 times in the playground while mothers and other children reacted with utter horror at the scene.</p>

<p><strong>Peaceful vigil participants hug.</strong></p>
<p>"What we want is to live peacefully in our own community without fear of anyone, especially cops. &nbsp;We want a peace movement and solidarity movement that respects life. &nbsp;Black lives, white lives, blue lives, and child lives are all important and even trying to state that one life is more important than another is part of that separation. &nbsp;God doesn't know that separation. &nbsp;God is loving and peaceful. &nbsp;This is not what Jesus taught us, but we can learn from this. &nbsp;This whole community is in shock by what happened to that little boy. &nbsp;Something has to change maybe this is the sign of the way forward." &nbsp;Proclaimed the local preacher.</p>
<p>Although other elements think more has to happen to enact real change. &nbsp;"We're never going to earn peace from the deep state and oligarchy by sitting here holding hands and praying for it. &nbsp;It takes action. &nbsp;While we ultimately want peace we may have to break some laws to get there; to lay our bodies on the machine and force it to grind to a halt. &nbsp;We are prepared to do that, but what about young people? &nbsp;Kids today don't leave school with those kinds of skills and this move is exactly what will help topple the kleptocracy. &nbsp;We need people with real skills from gorilla marketing, to hacking, to making pipe bombs... &nbsp;We applaud the move by Reading Rainbow and will increase our kickstarter donations." &nbsp;These fellows choose not to reveal their names.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>What's clear is that the decision has been met with various opinions, and only time will tell if having a public educated in "Smashing the State" will be the right one.</p>
