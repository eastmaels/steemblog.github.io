Had a nice show.  There weren't too many people looking to come on air so I was able to give more than 5 minutes per guest.  It's a good time.  I know lots of people have concerns about how the platform is doing and how the Minnow Support Project is growing.  It's fun to have people on to let them promote themselves and their projects.  It's pretty good 

@torico came on the show and we had a pleasant conversation.
@globocop came on the show and talked about mspwaves (our streaming radio station) operations and needs.
@pennsif came on to talk about witnesses and a project he's working on
@isaria came on the show to talk about our collective attempt to create more Lovejuice benefits for minnows as well as our upcoming MSP related project called The Peace Academy.

We played Dice Bitches.  @clayboyn won the dice roll of during the show and I sent him 25SBD.

@isaria won the 250 SP delegation that was available on the show to people that came on air.   She's at a total of 375 steem power delegation from me.  She's kinda a delegation magnet.


## The calls <h2>
I recorded the calls.  I have put them online through Mega.  This is my first attempt to let other folks hear the show in a recorded format.  The calls are in an .flv format.  The program VLC should be able to play these.  It's pretty handy and that way you can hear the interview and see the stuff going on in chat.
