So, today's hiccup had a few components that we've identified as problematic.

The least of the concerns is the code for scotbot, though that was the source of the error.  There was a small edge case that shut down the bot.  Holger fixed the edge case and restarted the bot, but didn't restart all parts of the bot so everything crashed briefly.  He restarted both and now things are working again.

A couple of challenges of this episode were not having duplicate holgers and not having a good way to reach him in the event of an error.  We're working on getting a backup holger.  We're working on communications pathways.

This project is still new, and I bet we'll discover more edge cases in the next month or two and they will likely shut down the bot briefly, but if that happens I request that you chill and wait cause we got this.  All the data is on the blockchain, we fix the thing, replay the block, and botta-boom you get your tokens.

Anyway, this will likely take a few weeks to plan, give notice, and shift.  It's coming.  Sorry for the inconvenience, but we'll get better because of this.

## Upgrades

As it turns out it's probably time for some server upgrades.  Steem-Engine has some steady income and the size of the db is growing so we'll work on getting some faster and bigger servers deployed. This takes planning.  It might even take a little bit of downtime.  So, if in the next week or two you see "undergoing maintenance" dont' freak out.  We're just making steem-engine better, faster, and future proofing some.

## Attorneys

I'm not going to go into too much detail just yet.  But let's just say the vision of steem-engine as a place where securities are traded is inching closer.

## Onboarding

Working on a solution to mass onboarding using steem-engine.  I hope to have some more announcements.

## Keychain mobile

Looking to get a mobile version of keychain or something with its utility moving... maybe I'll have more to report.

## Steem-engine mobile

Anyone have mobile dev skills?  Come hit me up in Discord.

## Partiko

Anyone know how to get in touch with partiko?  I'd like to speak with them!  Yes, it's Scot related... see where this might go?

## All systems green and growing

Thanks for your patience and support.  Glad to work with this community.  Looking forward to helping your token economy grow.
