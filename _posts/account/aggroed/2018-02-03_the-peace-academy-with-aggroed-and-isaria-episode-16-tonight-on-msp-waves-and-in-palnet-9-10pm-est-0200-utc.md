We may all have differences between us, but one thing that surely unites us all is our desire for **Peace**.  We want people to stop killing other people.  But, in order to work toward achieving peace we need to understand why we don’t have it in the first place.  What's causing systemic violence on this planet?

First, we need to wake up to the illusion of the 2 party system.  This illusion leads us to believe that we have a choice. There is no choice.  In every election more government wins and people lose more liberty and wealth.

We need to remove our consent and stop participating in this lie.  This is a step by step process of scaling back where we can as individuals to rely less on corporate consumerism, state services, and instead become more self reliant and network with our friends and neighbors for our needs.

The partisan bickering only serves to divide us.  This is no accident.  You are welcome to speak in the media between narrowly defined differences of Republicans and Democrats, but draw outside the lines or you'll be silenced.

This system is specifically designed to pit us against one another, to silence voices that don’t fall in line, and to do whatever it takes to spread their message of false narratives.

The government starts by creating fear within us especially when it comes to other countries.  Especially in America they combine this fear with a fierce nationalism to make us the divinely chosen and those that have what we want the sacrificial other that threatens our way of life.  So it goes when nations want war.  

They create this same fear right here at home in order to divide us and keep us distracted from the Truth of their lies.

While this is disheartening to hear or read it is also empowering.  Making a real difference in the world is not accomplished by voting for more government every four years, but by withdrawing consent and making different choices.  Through our choices we can achieve a life of peace, abundance, and liberty for all people on this planet.
