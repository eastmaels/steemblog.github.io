# <center> The Peace Academy with @aggroed and @isaria </center>

<center>

One of Isaria's favorite posts that I make are my *"Meme the News"* posts.
Most people tend to have a state of disbelief when people talk about news that is outside of the *"Mainstream Media"*, but here is something extrememly important to remember:
Roughly 6 Corporations own about 90% of Mainstream media.

[Source from businessinsider.com](http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6)

In order to truly achieve Peace, Abundance, and Liberty we need to be  ***informed***.  We need to understand that corporations do ***not*** have our best interests in mind, and we need to do our due diligence in finding the real ***truth*** in what is happening in our world.
Mainstream corporate media would lead you to believe that any other alternative news source is just bullshit conspiracy....this is by design.  
The best advice I can give is to read all the information you can find, then make up your own mind about what's really going on in the world.

So, tonight we will be discussing some world events that effect all of us, and talk about what we can do to help implement Peace, Abundance, and Liberty within our own lives, and ultimately in the world.

**_We also want to hear from you!_**

Be sure to join the audience chat during the show and let us know if you want to come on air with us!  
As long as what you have to say is about Peace, Abundance, or Liberty it's fair game!
