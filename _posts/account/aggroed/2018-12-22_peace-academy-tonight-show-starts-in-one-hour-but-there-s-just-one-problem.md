So, as you may or may not know I'm aggroed.  I'm a witness around the Steem ecosystem and I helped found a streaming braodcast station and now I'm a DJ on it.  Sometimes I use my old DJ name- Skanky J.

Anyway, tonight I'm hosting the Minnow University Curation show and the Peace Academy.  Normally I'm joined by the lovely and amazing @isaria, and also @swelker101 kicks it around sometimes too.

Actually, it's Shane that's the dependable one, @isaria has recently taken to coming on late and ditching us early, but I digress.  Anyway,  they can't make it tonight.  

So, I need a cohost.  Come on air, be my buddy, we can talk about what you'd like to talk about.  If no one wants to I'll just jam out with some 90s rock.

Are you out there special cohost?  Will you join me?
