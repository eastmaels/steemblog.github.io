Ok, after talking on the Peace Academy we landed at a discussion about creating a contest for what the perfect form of government might look like.  Now I know you guys just want to put "none" and call it a day, but let's try to do a little better than that.

One of the challenges of libertarians and anarchists is that whenever we talk to statists about the need to change the world they inevitably talk about how moving away from the current system would lead to warlords and death and for everyone.  They put the ownership on us to come up with a better system rather than acknowledging that there's a lot that's totally fucked about the system that they cheer, scream about, participate in, advocate for, and spread with glee.  So, I want some ideas from the non-statists.  I'm sure there are some complete anarchists that want absolutely nothing and want to barter shit or live in a society without any structure.  You can put answers in too.  

Personally I don't I'm quite that far.  I tend to think that people do better when they work together.  I just don't think that should be coercive.  So, my idea is PALnet and MSP.  A voluntary service based organization designed to uplift those in need.  It's not really a functioning business or government that imposes rules on people that don't want to be part of it. 
 We basically enforce some civility and otherwise let shit go.  It's a collection of independent people deciding to spend some of their time on a common mission of helping others.  Government is formed of stake weighted elected officials and those they appoint with support of the rest.  It's not perfect, but we've killed exactly no one, and gotten to 8,000 people without a single tax being laid.  No roads yet, but we have some programs, lots of resources handed out to the needy, saved a couple moms from eviction, sent some people across the world, and got some bitch'n servers running.  It's a start.

What I'd like for you to do is think of this as shopping for a government.  Imagine we exist in a world where all of these various government types exist and you can join which ever one you want at any time.  I'm interested in understanding what the key criteria would be for your system.  How would it work, what's the basis, who is in charge, how do they get there, where's the money come from, what's voluntary, what's not... Start thinking of some of the big picture stuff.

## Key things to include <h2>

Invented Name of the thing
Describe the type of government in 1 sentence or phrase (or even 1 word)
Key criteria that you think is necessary
Major red flags to avoid
Some basic guidelines of how it would work.

## How it works <h2>

Make a post
Link that post in the comments with the name and 1 sentence/phrase/word that describes what it is
Best posts get a resteem
I'll toss either SBD or some minnow votes at it depending on my mood (posts written on mspsteem.com will get 2X the rewards that posts written on Steemit will)
