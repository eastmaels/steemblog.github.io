"Give a minnow an upvote and they'll eat for a day. Give a minnow a resteem and they'll eat forever."

Hello Minnows!

I recently hit 900 followers and broke into the top 150 authors on Steemit. It had a lot to do with @kaylinart and @fyrstikken resteeming one of my posts. I literally jumped 550 followers within the last three weeks.  I'm going to keep mentioning them because of how grateful I am to have had their support.  It means this project can be successful and help a lot of newbies!

it got me thinking...

What if I could help my followers like @kaylinart and @frystikken helped me!?! It's pretty easy to do. All I have to do is resteem my followers!  What if I could get them a reward too!?!

## So, here are the rules <h2>
For every 100 upvotes I'll resteem a follower's post
To be able to get a resteem simply link your post (or a referral if you want) in the comments section. Make sure there are at least 3 days left on the post rewards because I'm not going to resteem until Thursday.
The first resteem is the post that gets the most upvotes.
The second resteem is the post I think is best based on a criteria of promoting Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.
Third and up are based on upvotes as well.
Getting upvoted by bots doesn't count.

## What counts as a minnow? <h2>
If you have less than 500 followers and less than 5,000SP at the time you post then you're a minnow that's eligible for the resteem and the reward!

## Which reminds me- I'm officially adding a reward to this.  Liquid post rewards go to the authors that win!  <h2>

So, upvote with some power folks.  The winners will like it!

## What about the first time winners <h2>

## My suggestion: Don't just leave it up to chance!  Campaign for your post! <h2>
This account is getting large enough now that a resteem, an award, and an announcement about you can help you get the most followers you've picked up in a day and maybe the most SBD you've gotten in a day.  Don't just leave a comment in the box with a post.  Give a quick summary, ask for a vote, and then write a post about the content and ask your followers in bulk through that post to support you and be sure to ask folks privately through chat to support you.

## I hope I can help you out as much as some follower whales helped me. <h2>

Lastly, any artist that wants to make a badge for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place will be loved, resteemed, and awarded a $50 SBD bounty.  If multiple people end up submitting I'll make a separate post, resteem, and award pool just for that.  This offer valid through Thursday.

With love and gratitude

Aggroed
