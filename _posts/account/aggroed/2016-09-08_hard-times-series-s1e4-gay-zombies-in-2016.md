<p>Zombies snarl...</p>
<p>"Mom... Dad... I want you to know I'm gay. &nbsp;Also, I think I may have been bitten."</p>
<p>Zombies smash at the front door.</p>
<p>"What's the Jacob? &nbsp;You're gay?!?" Jacob's father snapped!</p>
<p>"Harold! &nbsp;Don't you talk to him like that. &nbsp;Jacob what your father meant to say is that we'll love you no matter what." &nbsp;Jacob's mom chirped in.</p>
<p>"No son of mine is going to be gay. &nbsp;Zombie or not. &nbsp;I'm not having it!" &nbsp;Harold blurted out.</p>
<p>Zombies growl and keep banging on the door.</p>
<p>"Harold! &nbsp;That's not how he feels Jacob. &nbsp;You father just gets angry when he's surprised is all." &nbsp;Ingrid pushed against the door to keep the horde out, but managed to give a loving look to her son."</p>
<p>"I'm feeling woozy mom." Jacob's face seemed to be draining of blood.</p>
<p>"No woman. &nbsp;This is not just a passing anger thing. &nbsp;I for one will not stand for having a gay son. &nbsp;You are obviously going through a phase, possibly more than one..." &nbsp;Harold looked at the blood soaked sleeve of his son. &nbsp;"Anyway, this isn't the right time to choose to be gay. &nbsp;We're in the middle of something right now if you hadn't noticed."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harold cocked his shotgun and blew out the face of a zombie who had managed to get his head through the widening gap.</p>
<p>"I didn't choose this Dad. &nbsp;Any of this. &nbsp;It's not my fault! &nbsp;I just am who I am. &nbsp;Why can't you accept me." &nbsp;Jacob started sobbing as both the betrayal by his father and the pain of torn flesh and a partially broken wrist started setting in. &nbsp;He sat down and leaned back up against the wall.</p>
<p>Ingrid stabbed a zombie in the eye with a kitchen knife and then sliced through the wrist of another who had gotten his hand into a new crack in the door.</p>
<p>The sound of zombie snarls filled the room.</p>
<p>"Jacob, honey, I've known you were gay since you were 5 years old and played with dolls. &nbsp;Your brother played with dolls to spend time with girls. &nbsp;You played with dolls because you liked fashion. &nbsp;Sweetheart I've always known! &nbsp;And I've always loved you. &nbsp;Besides it's 2016. &nbsp;&nbsp;It's ok to be who you are now!" &nbsp;Ingrid was very supportive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A zombie grabbed hold of Ingrid's wrist. &nbsp;She took the knife and pushed it down hard. &nbsp;As she shifted her weight to do that the zombies inched the door open. &nbsp;Once she had her hand free she pushed the door back closed.</p>
<p>Harold starting shouting over the growls. &nbsp;"You knew since he was 5?!? &nbsp;When were you going to tell me Ingrid?!? &nbsp;I'm the boys father. &nbsp;If I had known back then maybe I could have done something about this." &nbsp;Harold came to the aid of his wife and shoved a sharpened stick through the head of a zombie pushing hard against the door. &nbsp;Blood blasted out of the zombies face and covered Ingrid and Harold.</p>
<p>"Oh now look what you've done. &nbsp;You'd soiled my last blood free blouse!" &nbsp;Ingrid shouted.</p>
<p>Jacob let out a low groan. &nbsp;"Mom? &nbsp;Dad? &nbsp;I can't see. &nbsp;I love you..."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Later that night... the house was quiet. &nbsp;Very quiet. &nbsp;And then there was a low groan coming from against the wall.</p>
