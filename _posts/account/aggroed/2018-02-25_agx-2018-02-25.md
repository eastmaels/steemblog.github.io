https://agx123.herokuapp.com//A2018-02-25.jpg<br/><br/>This is the chart for today 2018-02-25.<br/>Today's 200 days moving average factor is 0.92 for a STEEM/SBD ratio of 0.9.<br/>The AgX is factor is0.98.<br/><br/>![](https://agx123.herokuapp.com//B2018-02-25.jpg) <br/><br/>You can use the chart below to provide some historic suggestions of what's been good previously.  If the blue line is in the top third of the chart it's a good time to sell Steem.  If it's in the bottom it's a good time to sell SBD.  Past performance isn't a guarantee of current valuations or trends.<br/><h3>What is AgX?</h3><br/><br/>The Mayer's multiple (200 days moving average of the BTC/USD price) is known to be a good indicator of the BTC price evolution.
AgX aims to be a similar indicator regarding the STEEM/SBD ratio, in order for users to find the right moment to exchange their SBD for STEEM at the best possible rate.<hr/>Original idea by @aggroed (<a href="https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/account-witness-vote?witness=aggroed&amp;approve=1">Vote for witness</a>)<br/>Developed by @stoodkev (<a href="https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/account-witness-vote?witness=stoodkev&amp;approve=1">Vote for witness</a>)<hr/>

I'm moving this to @agx.  We'll keep making tweaks, but if you're wondering what happened to this daily report then check out @agx.
