OK, so, you've probably heard the term psychosomatic before.  If not it usually means that your body responds to a neural bad thing by creating pain.  Kids are being loud... you have a headache.  You're in a fight with a loved one lower back or chest pains.  You feel like you're supporting everything around you back and spine pain.  That kind of thing is psychosomatic pain.

Ok, well while watching Spirited Away I got the idea for a meditation that seems to help me quite a bit with the body aches that I have and helping to lose the shit that I don't want or need.  

Here's the link you might want to view the scene I'm talking about- Vimeo link won't post (I googled "youtube stink spirit spirited away")

Anyway, lead character finds this bloated spirit that smells and looks terrible.  In order to clean him she has to find the source.  Turns out he got hooked by something and filled with all kinds of negative shit.  Not only does she pull out the hook, but also starts pulling out all the things the hook caught in addition.  Eventually the spirit leaves rejuvanated, healthy, and no longer smelly.

So, here's what I propose.  Go into your meditation space.  Calm your shit down.  Breathe deep.  Start focusing on shit that hurts or is sore.  Imagine there is a fishing line in your hand that's connected to the pain.  Start pulling on the line in an effort to pull out the problems that are buried in the pain.  You'll get images and sensations that let you know what hurts and why.  Use those to think about what you need to emotionally heal in order to physically heal.  When the string evaporates from your hand and the spiritual things have been removed from the pain points you should be done with that session.

Hopefully you'll notice a reduction in pain and leave with an understanding of the emotional root of the issue.

Namaste bitches.
