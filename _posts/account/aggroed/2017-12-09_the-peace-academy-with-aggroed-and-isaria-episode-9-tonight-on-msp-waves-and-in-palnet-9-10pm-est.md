# <center> The Peace Academy with @aggroed and @isaria </center>


---

Join @aggroed and @isaria as they they discuss the concepts of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, and how we can best implement them in our daily lives.

Topics range from methods of conflict resolution, peaceful communication, truth of the world we live in, and what we can do about it.  We'll talk about a range of teachable skills to improve how we interact positively with one another in an effort to have nice things.

***We also want to hear from you!*** 

Be sure to join the audience chat during the show and let us know if you want to come on air with us!
As long as what you have to say is about Peace, Abundance, or Liberty it's fair game!

***The Peace Academy is an initiative brought to you by The Minnow Support Project with the goal of finding ways to bring Peace, Abundance, and Liberty into our lives and our communities.***
