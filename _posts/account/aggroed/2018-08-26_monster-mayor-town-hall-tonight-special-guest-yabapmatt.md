Howdy Ho Steem neighbors!  It's a great pleasure to host a radio show this evening with none other than my business partner @yabapmatt.  We're taking over the Minnow Mayor Town Hall with a stat chat about Monsters!

For all of you that have a lot of questions about stats and how they progress and what stuff a monster gets you won't get any information better than this.  We're working out the final details on the updated site, which will go live this coming week.  But in the meantime if you'd like to get looped in before everyone else this is your best chance!!!

## Logistics 

show starts at 9pm est 0100 utc
show airs on msp-waves.  You can listen at mspwaves.com/listen
the show is hosted in the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel](minnowpond.org)

Can't wait to see you there!

## Witness Pitch

if you don't vote for @yabapmatt as a witness I'd politely request that you take a moment to drop him a vote.  We're building some exceptional things on this blockchain (you'll see this month it goes beyond Steem Monsters).  If you'd like to see our projects keep expanding one of the best things you can do is vote for him as a witness.  steemit.com/~witnesses
