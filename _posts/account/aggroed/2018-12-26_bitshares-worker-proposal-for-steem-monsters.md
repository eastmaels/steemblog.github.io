Hey guys.  Some of you are hard core fans and supporters of Bit Shares.  Bit Shares is both a coin and Dex.  If you're new to Steem you might not know that Dan L. who was one of the original cofounders of Steem had previously founded BitShares before he moved onto to his final position as blockone dude and founder of EOS.

I'm a fan of BitShares.  I think it's a cool app and a great way to trade crypto.  Especially combined with convenient services like Blocktrades.us it gets pretty easy to move money around with a fair amount of anonymity across the crypto-webs.

I'm looking for tournament sponsors for Steem Monsters.  I'm going to spend some time getting worker proposals up on other chains where available.  The idea is that they give us tokens, we pass 100% of those tokens to Steem Monsters players while simultaneously making posts about tournaments etc.  We think it's a win-win.  Steem Monsters cards go up in value because they provide more value.  Apps/Dapps get exposure to our player base.  We have 4000 accounts that play, we have 20k games a day, and we get more than 100 people at any given tournament playing!

I've put in a BitShares worker proposal for 2500 BitShares per day.  We'll give 100% of those tokens out to players.  Hopefully it's a lot of new players who get exposed to BitShares for the first time.  If you're on BitShares please take a second to vote for the worker proposal.
