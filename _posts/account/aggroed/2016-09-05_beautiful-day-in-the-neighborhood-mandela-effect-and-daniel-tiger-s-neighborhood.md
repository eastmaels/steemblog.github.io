<p>Ok, when you're Mandela Effect hunting you often have to look for "reality residue" that supports your theory that this stuff was once something different.</p>
<p>The controversy here is over the lyrics in the intro song for Mr Roger and <a href="https://jingvitations.wordpress.com/2012/11/09/daniel-tigers-neighborhood-theme-song-lyrics/">Daniel Tiger</a>.</p>
<p>In Mr Rogers Neighborhood it's "It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood." &nbsp;In Daniel Tiger the lyrics are "It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood."</p>
<p>People experiencing the Mandela Effect swear the line has always been in both shows THE neighborhood. &nbsp;THIS neighborhood is a shitty line. &nbsp;It's like it's only nice for Mr. Rogers and everyone else doesn't have a beautiful day. &nbsp;It doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>Ok, so now here are two shows that reference the line directily. &nbsp;Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood which was a skit on Saturday Night Live by Eddie Murphy where he uses THE Neighborhood in 4 different episodes spanning 2 years. &nbsp;We also have it on Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood.</p>
<p>The tricky part come the battle of when you see Reality Residue like this is it evidence that people had a different reality elsewhere or is it evidence that things exist in the world that would trick people into misquoting lines and misremembering lyrics.</p>
<p>To the people that grew up watching these shows over and over and knowing the context changes that word changes imply there is no way we just misheard it. &nbsp;To the people in this reality they seem like "nutters" who can't figure out a line that's always been that way. &nbsp;I personally think both realities existed and somehow they merged and now people grew up experiencing one or the other.</p>
<p>Anyway, especially since Tiger was a character on Mr. Rogers Neighborhood and the whole show is basically a spin off you'd think they'd be able to get the theme song right, but Mr Roger's and Tiger's/Robinson's intros are different. &nbsp;That's "Mandela Effect proof."</p>
