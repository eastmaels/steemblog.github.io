Once a month on the last Saturday of the month I host a Steem Witness Panel discussion.  This one featured an opening statement from @andrarchy; Director of Content for Steemit.  He talks about the culture at Steemit, the most recent @steemitblog post and the most recent @steemitdev post.

Then we dove into thoughts from the various witnesses regarding the current state of the platform, problems to address on the platform, and where we might expect some challenges to face us.

The panelists include:
@timcliff, @curie via @carlgnash, @aggroed, @furion,  @cervantes, and @exyle

The first 20-30 min are @andrarchy, the next 30 min or so are each of the witnesses introducing themselves, the next 30 min are problems we face, and then we open it up to some general discussion and closing statements.

## Upcoming Panels <h2>

March 3rd Steem Artist panel with @stellabelle and @juliakponsford
