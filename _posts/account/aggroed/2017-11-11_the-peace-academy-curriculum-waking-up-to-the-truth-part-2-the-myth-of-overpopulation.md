# <center> The Myth of Overpopulation </center>

The myth of overpopulation came about in England, 1798 by Thomas Malthus.
He believed that our food production could not keep up with the exponential growth of humans and determined that the world would be out of food by 1890.
In his "Essay on the Principle of Population”, he actually formulated a plan to kill the poor and less fortunate citizens so that the wealthy and elite would have enough food and resources.
[An Essay on the Principle of Population](http://www.econlib.org/library/Malthus/malPlong30.html#firstpage-bar)

Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University expanded upon this erroneous idea in 1968 when he claimed that famines would decimate humanity by the 1970’s to due “reckless human reproduction”.


This led to the creation of the UNFPA, which is the United Nations Fund for Population Activities.
This organization is funded by the elite and is responsible for population control programs and propaganda fear tactics of a manufactured crisis that isn’t real.

We don’t need to kill innocent people to take their resources and we don’t need to prevent people from existing in the first place.

The fact is that we have enough natural resources for everyone to live in abundance.

The technological revolution eliminated the problems we used to have in obtaining resources, but another problem arose as a result:
***Greed and abuse, industrial pollution, and the hoarding of land and resources by the elite.***

This is the actual problem we are facing.



The myth of over-population is purposely designed to create a scarcity mindset.
There is plenty of room on this planet for everyone. 
If you took the population density of Paris and you forced the whole world to live at that population density, you could fit the entire population of the planet into the state of Texas.

The idea of over-population is just another example of manufactured reality to keep us in a fear based scarcity mindset which is overwhelmingly unhealthy for human existence.
