# Conflict Resolution Part 1


Get a group of humans together in one place and some form of conflict will inevitably arise.
Having a variety of personalities in one group can bring about differences of opinion, values, beliefs, culture, philosophies. and social concepts.
Individual personal issues such as emotional baggage, projections, and unhealthy boundaries can also add to the potential for conflict.

Using strategies for conflict resolution is imperative in order to establish and maintain peace within a community.

## 5 Methods for Conflict Resolution 

* If you are feeling angry and raw it is best to take some time to cool down before attempting further communication.  

* When you feel calm enough to communicate, listen to the other person without interrupting.  Try to focus on what they are saying instead of just thinking about what you want to say next.  Try to understand what they are saying from their perspective.

* Use Active/Reflective listening.  After the other person has finished communicating their thoughts, restate what they said to you.  This shows that you were truly listening and it also helps to clarify any misunderstandings.

* Remember to focus on the problem.   Attacking the person will only result in further conflict.  Try to avoid placing blame on the other person.  Shouting, condescending statements, and personal insults must be avoided.

* Don’t assume to know what the other person is thinking or feeling. Sometimes coflicts arise because we have an idea in our heads about someone’s intentions that may be wrong.  Ask the other person what their intention is, what they are thinking, and how they are feeling.  Effective and clear communication is key.
