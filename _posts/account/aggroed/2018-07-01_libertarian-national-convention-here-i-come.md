I’m on my way to NOLA for a brief stay.  I’m headed to give a workshop at the libertarian national convention.  I got here by way of having Adam Kokesh on my radio show.  He’s a candidate for president.  His campaign chair Angela invited me.  So here I go.

## politics

I’m no stranger to politics.  I ran for state office.  I won six thousand votes.  I lost, but I’m thankful.  That starry eyed kid ran as a Democrat.  I still hold progressive values.  All people deserve a good education, food, access to the internet, shelter, and peace.  I have since stopped believing this government is at all capable of delivering on those ideals.

## choice

When I think of government I think there are too few.  We have 7 billion people and 170 governments.  That’s not enough competition or enough choice.  In my ideal world when a human reaches 18 they can choose what government they would like to subscribe to and for how long.  Some people may want a nanny state.  Let them choose it.  Some may want a libertarian republic.  Let’s make that available.  Let’s stop pretending that the USF or any government truly serves its people well.

I think it should look like picking health insurance.  What plan, at what cost, for which benefits.  Then everyone can have what they want.

Government can serve a convenient and good service.  That’s why it’s such a shame we have such a shitty organization running our country.

## Peace, Abundance, and Liberty

The world is at war.  We are empoverished from central banking.  We are spied on daily by those we entrusted to keep us safe.  The world is upside down and needs a heavy dose of PAL.  I’m hoping that by exposing libertarians to the block chain that we can have a measure of free speech protected by code than people.

Should be fun.
