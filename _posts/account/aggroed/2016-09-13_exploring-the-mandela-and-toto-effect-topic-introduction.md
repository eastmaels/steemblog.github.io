<p>The Mandela Effect is the difference in recollection of large groups of people relative to recorded history for small intangible things like movie quotes, and book titles.</p>
<p>The Toto Effect is the difference in recollection of large groups of people relative to recorded history and current evidence for more substantial things like changes in geography, religion, history, products, and human anatomy.</p>
<p>The presence of the Mandela Effect is not terribly controversial. &nbsp;Most people, including main stream scientists, willingly admit there are large gaps between memory and reality. &nbsp;The cause of the Mandela Effect however is extremely contentious. &nbsp;The modern explanation is Confabulation, which basically means you people get confused. &nbsp;Another modern explanation is that people simply mis-remember. &nbsp;I put together several quizzes. &nbsp;To test these things out-</p>
<p>Here’s the short quiz: <a href="http://www.quiz-maker.com/QYN1BOG">http://www.quiz-maker.com/QYN1BOG</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s a quiz used in a scientific study: <a href="http://www.quiz-maker.com/QRVR3A">http://www.quiz-maker.com/QRVR3A</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s the quiz that covers the most topics: <a href="http://www.quiz-maker.com/Q6G9ZLT">http://www.quiz-maker.com/Q6G9ZLT</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will you please take one or more of these quizzes?&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this point after waiting slightly over 1 year I've collected 30k responses and to date have analyzed more than 25k of them for the scientific study questions. &nbsp;I've summarized the results that I could gleam simply from that research into this youtube video that's been watched close to 3000 times in the first week it's been available on Youtube.</p>

<p>While at first it would appear that the Mandela Effect is simply a reflection of people having shitty memories and low reading/media comprehension it turns out that is not always the case. &nbsp;While the general population suffers from memory loss and misunderstanding people that self report being extremely confident in their answers are correct 95% of the time or more on control questions were no Mandela Effect is present. &nbsp;When those same people are asked similar questions when the Mandela Effect is involved people provide wildly different answers indicating that they have the ability to know the information, but seem to inexplicably provide different answers.</p>
<p>How the hell could that be? &nbsp;That's the central question that's worth looking into. &nbsp;Initial results indicate it isn't a memory failure of the people answering questions nor is it simply low comprehension. &nbsp;If neither of those are responsible then it opens up the question to a much broader topic. &nbsp;If details of the universve around us aren't fixed, but change, our interpretation of the rules for the universe have to change with it. &nbsp;If one can go to sleep and wake up where titles of movies, lines in songs, human anatomy, biblical stories, history, and geography can change within that one nights rest a systemic investigation into how that's possible is extremely warrented. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Are time travellers changing things? &nbsp;Did we go through a wormhole? &nbsp;Is this whole universe and evertyhing that we remember experiencing simply a simulation? &nbsp;Are there multiple universes? multiple realities? &nbsp;multiple planes of reality? &nbsp;Is the Mandela Effect a tangible way to measure these things?</p>
<p>The starting hypothesis that the Mandela Effect implies is that reality as we know it, past, present and future, isn't fixed, and it's time to investigate further.</p>
