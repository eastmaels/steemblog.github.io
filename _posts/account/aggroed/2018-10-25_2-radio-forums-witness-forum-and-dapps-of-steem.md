![Witness Forum.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmaRdp7k9ww6ZErWXZ4RrFfLpBDBxLoJHwDc77xW9jGsim/Witness%20Forum.png)

This Saturday is the Steem Witness forum.  Andrarchy will join us and then we'll have a discussion of changes to the platform.  We're migrating to some bug fixes on 20.6 as we steadily approach the day SMTs finally drop.

I'm still looking for some witnesses so if you're not in the top 20 and would like to join us please message me in Discord.  

For anyone looking to go on air please make sure you have a working mic and headset.  Show up a little early.

Show start 11am EST (new york city time) on Saturday.

## Dapps of Steem

Also putting together a forum for next Saturday.  It's a digital exhibit call I'm calling Dapps of Steem.  If you have an app or Dapp that works on or with the Steem blockchain and you want people to know about it message me and we'll get you some time to just give a quick pitch on your prodcut, what it does, and how it can help steemians.

That'll be Nov 3rd at 11am est (NYC time).

## Logistics

Please join us in the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel](minnowpond.org) home of the Minnow Support Project.
