<p>Colin Kaepernick has shocked the world when he decided to stand up for human rights by sitting down during the national anthem.</p>
<p><img src="http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/09/02/d0391af5-d5ef-4e2b-a914-202f10887d80/thumbnail/620x350/1da8d3982ac0c2000f762eb6fb0ab795/ap-16246081369655.jpg"/></p>
<p>Kaepernick <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/49ers/2016/09/14/colin-kaepernick-protest-kneel-police-brutality-san-francisco/90375234/">declares </a>that the reason for his protest surrounds continued cases of police brutality. &nbsp;</p>
<p>" (The police) have a badge, yes. But you are supposed to be protecting us, not murdering us. That is what the issue is, and we need to change that." &nbsp;Additionally he states</p>
<p>“Terrence Sterling … an unarmed black man once again. It has become habitual. It is an issue that needs to be addressed, because it continues to happen, and every time it is ‘administrative leave’ (as the punishment). That is not right. That is the issue that needs to be addressed, and policies need to be addressed to change that.” "</p>
<p>Some not so outraged by the protest have suggested that the correct solution to this is to <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/force-police-accountability-city/">force police to carry liability insurance</a> like other professionals have to. &nbsp;If they don't act within reason and are held accountable they will quickly lose their ability to be hired or work profitably in the field because their insurance premiums would be too high for it to be worth it to towns and individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The national protest sparked conservative anger and <a href="http://www.today.com/video/star-spangled-controversy-outrage-grows-over-colin-kaepernick-s-refusal-to-stand-during-the-national-anthem-753454147868">outrage</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x8VzE7Z7y2c/maxresdefault.jpg" width="1920" height="1016"/></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-kaepernick-anthem-20160904-snap-story.html">police unions</a> have also expressed their potential boycott and non-performance at the SF 49s games as a result of his actions.</p>
<p>All of that happened last week, but this week things have intensified as he joined in protests burning the american flag.</p>
<p><img src="http://skeptikai.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Burning-American-flag.jpeg"/></p>
<p>He converted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism">Wahhabism</a>, an extremest and violent sect that defies all peaceful aspects of Islam.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.biyokulule.com/sawiro/sawirada_waaweyn/Saudi%20religious%20sermon1_1.jpg"/></p>
<p>and then joined ISIS.</p>
<p><img src="http://drrichswier.com/wp-content/uploads/kapernick-hoodie-and-tshirt.jpg"/></p>
<p>The CIA and George Soros were quick to stand up for his right to protest this way while the Christian base of the republican party went absolutely ballistic.</p>
<p>Kaepernick threw only 15 throws for 24 yards in the San Francisco win over the Detroit Lions 28-0.</p>
