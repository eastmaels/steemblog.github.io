<p>Republicans are in another uproar this week as their Presidential nominee for the party experienced what he called "A severe bias against my campaign." &nbsp;The remarks came following the presidential debate where Republicans suspect their candidate was given electroshocks during the debate.</p>

<p><strong>The first moment Trump was shocked during the debate.</strong></p>
<p>Republican strategist Norm Whitey says "Look at Lester! &nbsp;What is he hiding under his hand? &nbsp;If you look at Trump's expressions over the course of the night and some of his odd behavior you can only come to one conclusion. &nbsp;He was given elctroshocks by Loser Lester."</p>

<p><strong>Trump again shouts in pain as the electricity flows through his body.</strong></p>
<p>Democrats however are calling fowl. &nbsp;Hillary Clinton shared "There is nothing in the <a href="https://steemit.com/politics/@aggroed/satirically-yours-s1e25-cersei-lannister-to-debate-the-governor-in-tonight-s-presidential-debate">rules </a>regarding about administering electroshocks to Republicans in a debate. &nbsp;Not one single rule mentions it. &nbsp;This is all taking away from the fact that he clearly lost the debate. &nbsp;You can view the polls and they all clearly show how his demeanor and personality lost him this chance to win over the American People."</p>

<p>Not to be outdone on TV by Hillary Trump was quick to share a tweet where it appears he's making the claim that Hillary Clinton was wearing a therapeutic wire to stave off involuntary shaking associated with Parkinson's Disease or Parkinsonism.</p>

<p>He also made sure to mention her "stamina" multiple times.</p>
<p>Hillary as a take no prisoners kind of candidate shot back through Twitter referencing conspiracy claims of an illicit relationship between Donald and his daughter Ivanka.</p>

<p>Lester continues to take criticism for his moderation as he appeared at times to help Clinton through the questions he asked, the interruptions he chose, and the multiple uses of shocks.</p>
