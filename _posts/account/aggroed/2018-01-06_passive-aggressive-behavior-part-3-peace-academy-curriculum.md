# Passive Aggressive Behavior in Communities and/or the Workplace
Passive Aggressive Behavior tends to be prevalent in the work place due to the professional nature and hierarchy of business structures.
People spend a majority of time with their co-workers and naturally form relationships, but expressing emotions is often deemed unacceptable due to the professional standards of the work environment.
And depending on the work environment, it can be objectionable or at the very least uncomfortable to even assertively express anger due to the hierarchical structure of the business model.
