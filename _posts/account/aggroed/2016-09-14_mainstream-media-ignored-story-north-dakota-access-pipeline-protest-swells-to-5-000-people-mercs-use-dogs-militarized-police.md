<p>The <a href="http://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends/warriors-rainbow-prophecy-001577">Rainbow Warriors </a>Assembles- At this point <a href="http://remezcla.com/culture/dakota-access-pipeline-indigenous-action/">280 tribes</a> from across North America and Hawaii have gathered together along with water protectors of all colors to make up a total camp population exceeding 5,000 people to protect the &nbsp;Missouri river and stop the North Dakota Access Pipeline. &nbsp;This is extreme dedication by the protesters who had their <a href="http://indigenousamerican.com/2016/09/11/homeland-security-cuts-water-supply-to-native-tribes-protesting-pipeline/2/">access to water and cell service shut off </a>by Homeland Security. &nbsp;It's the largest tribal protest in 100 years.</p>
<p>The proposed and partially constructed pipeline crosses underneath the Missouri and Mississippi river multiple times on it's way from North Dakota through South Dakota into Iowa and Illinois in a 1,170 mile trek. &nbsp;Especially with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pipeline_accidents_in_the_United_States_in_the_21st_century">history of similar pipelines</a> to leak frequently the tribes are united against the poisoning of their water source.</p>

<p>Standing Rock Tribal Chairman David Archambault II shared in an interview through Indian Country on August 24th 2016:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2014/02/18/18bd4820ea2531064c0f6a7067007649_c0-290-4605-2973_s326x190.jpg?8a32bd6761a1dfa355f9be4115b06de99994a30c" width="326" height="190"/></p>
<p><a href="http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/08/24/exclusive-interview-standing-rock-sioux-chairman-david-archambault-ii-suit-against-dakota ">"This is a Dallas-based company making all these decisions—Energy Transfer Partners are deciding what takes place for Dakota Access Pipeline. There’s no sensitivity, there’s no understanding of what our tribes and what our folks have had to deal with for over 100 years. It should be a rude awakening to them, and it should also be a message with all the support that tribes no longer want the government to run over us. Tribes no longer want big corporations to take advantage of us."</a><br>
</p>
<p>August 24th was the same date that the Department of Justice heard from both sides. &nbsp;On September 9th they issued this <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/joint-statement-department-justice-department-army-and-department-interior-regarding-standing">ruling</a>-</p>
<p>"Therefore, construction of the pipeline on Army Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe will not go forward at this time.&nbsp; The Army will move expeditiously to make this determination, as everyone involved — including the pipeline company and its workers — deserves a clear and timely resolution.&nbsp; In the interim, we request that the pipeline company voluntarily pause all construction activity within 20 miles east or west of Lake Oahe."&nbsp;</p>
<p>They added this statement about peaceful protest-</p>
<p>“In recent days, we have seen thousands of demonstrators come together peacefully, with support from scores of sovereign tribal governments, to exercise their First Amendment rights and to voice heartfelt concerns about the environment and historic, sacred sites.&nbsp; It is now incumbent on all of us to develop a path forward that serves the broadest public interest.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last statement couldn't have been more ironic. &nbsp;Energy Transfer Partners is playing by a different set of rules. &nbsp;They expect 570,000 barrels of oil to move through the pipeline every day. &nbsp;At today's price of $46/barrel of crude oil that amounts to around $10B/year. &nbsp;Apparently, they are less willing to negotiate a peaceful appraoch. &nbsp;They hired mercenaries from <a href="http://www.g4s.us/en-US/">G4S </a>as in the same G4S that was recently in the news because of the pulse nightclub.</p>
<p>Anyway, they have a significantly different approach than suggested by the public relations section of the DOJ. &nbsp;They put out a number of <a href="http://www.indeed.com/q-Security-Guard-l-North-Dakota-jobs.html">job listings</a>. &nbsp;I don't see dog handler to maul water protectors listed, but I'm assuming there is a different code name in there. &nbsp;Anyway, as you can see by the image with a dog with a mouth filled with protestor blood things turned violent. &nbsp;Note, the protesters were peacefully demonstrating. &nbsp;The mercs were not.</p>

<p>Below is a video that got Amy Goodman, anchor for Democracy Now! in hot water from September 3rd.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuZcx2zEo4k</p>
<p>You can watch the full episode of the show <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2016/9/6/full_exclusive_report_dakota_access_pipeline">here</a>.</p>
<p>Well, that video went viral and the state didn't take kindly too it. &nbsp;Goodman was <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2016/9/10/breaking_arrest_warrant_issued_for_amy">charged </a>with criminal trespassing, a misdemeanor offense.&nbsp; &nbsp;The police have clearly chosen a side as no warrants for any of the security forces that attacked the protesters with dogs and mace were issued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board &nbsp;who issues licences for company that handle private security were <a href="http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/private-security-board-to-investigate-guard-dogs-used-at-nd/article_c75ad9fc-c722-5e61-9578-c392a4fab7ff.html">handed a petition signed by 100k people</a> who were angry at the violence displayed by G4S's mercenary army.</p>
<p>In a great sign of solidarity and anti-corporate demonstration <a href="http://www.jill2016.com/">presidential candidate Jill Stein </a>was on site to spray paint pro-protector messages on bulldozers.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8FSKJzcfEM</p>
<p>The DOJ is famously known for letting presidential candidates off the hook over legal fouls, but not this time. &nbsp;An <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/09/08/arrest-warrants-issued-jill-stein-says-campaign-proud-pipeline-protest">arrest warrant</a> has been served to Dr. Stein as well.</p>
<p>Despite the DOJ notice that the army core has to suspend construction in some areas the company continues to build the pipeline and desecrate sacred native burial sites. &nbsp;If that wasn't enough the state has mobilized heavily armed police who are practically militarized in order to arrest protesters and enable construction.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.anonews.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dakota-arrests.jpg" width="728" height="380"/></p>
<p>You can watch the police arrest protesters and hear peaceful and unarmed water protectors discuss how the police pointed live fire automatic weapons at them at the link below. &nbsp;It's a video taken by a team of journalists working for an outfit called Unicorn Riot who themselves ultimately get arrested.</p>
<p>http://livestream.com/accounts/12767816/events/6340986</p>
<p>Facebook did their part to help Energy Transfer Partners build their pipeline by blocking Unicorn Riot from posting their video.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.anonews.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fb-blocked-dakota-1.jpg" width="960" height="576"/></p>
<p>Bernie Sanders also takes his shots at the company. &nbsp;He joined a solidarity protest in Washington state to speak out in favor of the protesters.</p>
<p><img src="http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/51/52/44/10922271/3/920x920.jpg"/></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the government is talking about peace through one mouth piece and acting violently and against long standing treaties with the natives. &nbsp;Not only is the government acting against the best interest of the natives, but also the hundreds of thousands of people across at least 5 states that use that water to run their homes and businesses. &nbsp;<strong>Help spread the word</strong> about what's really going on because the media is biased and hiding the violence and corruption of the state/corporations/mercenaries.</p>
<p>The protest is clearly working against the company financially!</p>
