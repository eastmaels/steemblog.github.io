I think Sounds of Steem was one of my favorite radio shows I've ever done.  If you're not routinely listening to Steem musicians it's hard to believe just how talented they are.  I get blown away.  For years I made my own lettuce using aquaponics.  I'd take a bite after months of store bought food and be shocked by just how much flavor and richness the plant had.  This is similar.  After years of listening to vapid nonsense on the radio where any song with any meaning or content other than repetitive whining and pining for love is gone this feels wholly good.
