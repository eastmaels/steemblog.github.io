Hey folks,  well, shane dun got his car broked.  So, isaria has gun on to rescue my fair, tall, and galant cohost leaving me all alone for 2 hours of radio.  Very scary.  So, I've gone ahead and enlisted the queen of curation herself to come join us on air.  @llfarms is gonna hop on and I suppose we'll talk homesteading, curation, and who knows what else.

The first half of the show is usually pretty meandering.  We'll still look out for some posts to curate from the audience.  I'm open to on air readings.  We'll see what you guys come up with.

We may talk about some Steem Monsters stuff.  We got some changes coming early next week and here's a good opportunity to share some news.

Lastly, the Peace Academy can be many things.  Sometimes conspiracy, sometimes woo-woo, sometimes deeply personal.  Let thy heart be thy compass and let's see where she goes.

Show starts in 15 min on mspwaves.com/listen and in [PALnet](minnowpond.org).  See you there.
