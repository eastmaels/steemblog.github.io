Starting in just under 3hrs the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network](https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw) is pleased to host the Steem Impact Forum focusing on Venezuela.  Venezuela is having a horrific experience of watching their currency hyperinflate.  A small salvation to the economic crisis there has been the cryptocurrency Steem.  Venezuelans have been able to earn crytocurrency and use it to pay for food, clothing, and shelter.  

A USD is worth 10 Venezuelan Bolivars.  An SBD is worth 3.5 USD.  That means a single SBD is worth 35 Bolivars.  In the country where an engineer might only earn $20 USD per MONTH the ability to generate a monthly salary with 1 good post or several smaller posts marks a unique life support.

I've asked some folks from Venezuela to speak to us at 11am EST.  that's 3hrs from this post being released (1500 UTC).  I'd love it if you can join us, meet some of the Venezuelans that are on the platform and sharing in their home country, and learn about their struggles and various perspectives on how we got there.

## Logistics

Join us in the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network](https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw).

You can also listen live at mspwaves.com/listen.

If you're coming on air please have a microphone and earbuds/headset.  You don't want the sounds of the show going into the mic.


## Rules

Like all PALnet events there are some very basic rules.  We're not thought police.  it's a Liberty platform.  You can make any argument you want.  That said we're also a peace group so the exception would be inciting violence or verbally harassing/insulting other guests, hosts, or audience members.


## Translation

We have a bot that operates in PALnet that can translate languages.

If you'd like to translate try these commands
