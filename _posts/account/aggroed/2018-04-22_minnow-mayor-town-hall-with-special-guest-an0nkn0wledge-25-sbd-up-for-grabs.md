![Steemit Minnow.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYKN49Ys7HYhQC8N4mYkseJCyi7PP3hDauD5uaKJN3eHS/Steemit%20Minnow.png)

Should be a fun night.  Once again I'm blessed to have an intrepid journalist join in on MSP-Waves to talk about a variety of discoveries that he's made, truth he's released, and a give us a picture of politics and the USA you can't find anywhere else.

## Show Logistics

Show starts at 9pm est.  That's 0100 UTC.  @an0nkn0wledge will join us about an hour into the show.  That gives us all some time to settle in, talk about what's happening on the block and share a story or two.

To tune in join us in [the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord channel](minnowpond.org).  We have 17,000 Steemians in there.  Should be fun.

To connect with the audience and the guests hop into some channels.

## Delegation

I stopped doing personal delegations for the most part, but I sectioned off a bunch of SP for msp-active.  If you're not getting votes from msp-active but think you're active in the Minnow support community than reach out ot me in Discord with a 1 sentence pitch of why i should include you.

## Dice Bitches

We'll play dice.  Up for grabs is 25 SBD.  Typical rules.  I roll.  You roll.  You tie or beat my roll than you move onto the next round.  Last person standing wins.

If I win once we start from scratch.  If I win twice I have a special extra gift for Suz.

## Everyone can come on the show

Have a post you want to promote?
Have a thing you're working on?
Want to share something?
Want to talk about bid bots and curation?

You can talk about whatever.  I'll share my $0.02.  All thoughts are welcome, just don't purposefully try to be an asshole with your opinions and it's all welcome.

## Coming on air?

Make sure you have a mic and a headset!  You'll sound terrible if your speaker sound is feeding back into your mic!
