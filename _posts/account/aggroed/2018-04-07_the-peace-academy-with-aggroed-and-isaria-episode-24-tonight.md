# <center> The Peace Academy with @aggroed and @isaria </center>

<center>

Last week our show focused on Abundance.  
This week we’ll focus on Liberty and Truth.

  

  

The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow, but we can’t hope to change the world if we don’t understand what’s really going on.

 I’ve started a new post series called *Aggroed’s Antidote* where I’ll be researching hard to find news stories from trusted and verified sources and sharing them in order to create awareness.  I've also started posting about a person or group claiming to have Q level clearance that is supposedly helping bring down the illegal, unlawful, and unethical cabal that runs the west.  We'll talk about that tonight!

The Corporate Mainstream Media is designed to keep news stories that don’t fall into their agenda out of public view so we’ll be sharing those stories with you tonight.

**_We also want to hear from you!_**

Be sure to join the audience chat during the show and let us know if you want to come on air with us!  
As long as what you have to say is about Peace, Abundance, or Liberty it's fair game!
