During Episode 17 we talked about Corruption and Mainstream vs. Alternative media.

We have to have an understanding of what is going on in the world if we ever hope to change things.

Many are blind to the corruption that exists, which isn’t surprising as roughly 90% of mainstream media is owned by only 6 corporations.

With this being the case, we need to dig deeper to find the real Truth.

  

**Here’s a list of some Alternative Media sources to check out:**  Many of these go deep into the esoteric and weirder side of things.  I would suggest taking what resonates and leaving the rest for another day.  I'm not going to support everything they say, but I think these sources have some of the most useful things

As you dive down the various rabbit holes in search of the Truth, you will likely experience what is known as…..

  

**The Truther Process**

  

* Finding out the world doesn’t work the way you thought - depression

* Realizing how it actually works - more depression

* And finally, a realization that it is actually empowering when you understand that there is an alternative to build a different pathway to Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  Once you have a deeper understanding you can begin to root out the weeds that dampen your ability to thrive.
