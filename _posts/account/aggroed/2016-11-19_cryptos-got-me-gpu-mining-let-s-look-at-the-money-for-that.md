<p>In part 1 I talked about the profitability of ASIC devices as far as I can tell. &nbsp;In part 2 I'm going to talk about the profitability of GPU mining.</p>
<p>I started mining with the old video card in my computer to see if I even had the skills necessary to do it. &nbsp;I had a GEFORCE GTX 950. &nbsp;This was a pretty decent card like 4 years ago. &nbsp;Anyway, I tried mining with it. &nbsp;I got 20 sols/sec with my CPU using the nicehash miner, but I couldn't get my graphics card to mine. &nbsp;So... I upgraded.</p>
<p>I purchased windows 10. &nbsp;I also got 2 Radeon 470 4gig ddr5 cards (my gaming pc can take 2). &nbsp;The cards cost me $170 each. &nbsp;Windows 10 was $120.</p>
<p>I started trying the nicehash miner, but it kept crashing my computer. &nbsp;So, I switched to <a href="https://mega.nz/#F!P0ZjFDjC!Cmb-ZRqlbAnNrajRtp4zvA">claymore's miner</a>.</p>
<p>I'm now rocking 155 and 155 H/s on my two GPUs.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/055f40a872.jpg" width="960" height="478"/></p>
<p>So, right now those make 0.0025 btc per day on nice hash, which is $1.86. &nbsp;The computer overall is pull 453 watts at the wall. &nbsp;The GPUs themselves are pulling about 120 watts each. &nbsp;I leave my computer on all day, so for the moment I'm going to discount the 313 watts that are wasted by me anyways by leaving the computer on.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>120*24*.19/1000= $0.54</p>
<p>So each of my graphics cards is making $1.32/day or $482/yr.</p>
<p>Now, let's pretend I have a 6 GPU machine. &nbsp;I'll assume it still needs 300 watts at the wall and then there are 6 hungry GPUs eating 120 watts at the wall too.</p>
<p>that's 920 watts. &nbsp;That's $4.20/day in electricity. &nbsp;They make $11.16/day in BTC. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In a year that rig could make $2540 profit. &nbsp;You're going to lose some to Claymore's development fees, and conversions and Nicehash fees, but take off 3% of $2540 and it's still a good chunk of change. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That said there are a bunch of variables. &nbsp;Claymore's speed changes. &nbsp;Nicehash payout changes. &nbsp;Value of ZEC goes up/down. &nbsp;Cost of electricity changes. etc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But at least on the outside it looks like you can GPU or ASIC mine now if you have the right equipment.</p>
