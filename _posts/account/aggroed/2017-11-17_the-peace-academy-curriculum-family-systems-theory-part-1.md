# Family Systems Theory Part 1

Created by Dr Murray Bowen, Family Systems Theory is a psychological concept designed to help us view our experiences through our connections with others rather than only viewing them through the lens of our individual psyches.

The benefit of this system is that it helps us to see other’s perspectives and avoid blaming, or feeling like a victim.

Family Systems Theory states that our human relationships are managed by our emotional systems and that interdependence is often a result of the interaction within family members or close groups.


This interdependence is shown when acting with the intention of gaining approval or attention, and also by reacting to other’s expectations, needs, and emotions.

Some family systems are loosely interdependent while others experience intense interdependence, which can create a domino effect of feelings and emotions.

This concept is based on the fact that we are not isolated beings.  
We are all connected and our thoughts, feelings, and actions affect each other.

And even though this theory primarily relates to how we function within in our immediate families, we can still use this approach to understand how we function within a group or community.

The team of leaders at the Minnow Support Project have created some rules and guidelines to help people on the platform have healthy discussions on and off the chain.  We have community standards and rules.  We also have a system that we use for dealing with interpersonal drama that has proven to be insanely valuable.  

## Important Documents that we use as the foundation of the our System <h2>

We haven't released the rules for interpersonal drama resolution, but those should be coming shortly in a block ready format.
