I wanted to work through a couple of thoughts on using steembottracker to help people make better decisions when they are using the bidbots.  So, I recorded this video below and I basically walk people through the site.

If you missed my last milestone post I gained 1k followers in the last week.  I attribute it to a few things, but bid bots played a role.  So, I wanted to show other people how it's done.  I'm co-owner of this site now for full disclosure sake, and hopefully you realize that bid bots are fun, have a promotional purpose, but definately carry risk (especially with sbd trading at 10USD).  Here I try to reduce that risk for you as much as possible by giving the best explanation I can.
