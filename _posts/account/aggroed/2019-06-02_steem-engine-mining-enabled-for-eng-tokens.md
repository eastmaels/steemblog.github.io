Well, when I said we're close on mining release I wasn't kidding.  Here's the first token you can mine on the platform- ENG.

To mine the token you either buy the ENG Miner token (EM) or the EMFOUR token.  The EMFOUR token is 4 times more powerful than a ENG Miner token, but comes at a discount!

There's an inflation pool that's set as of today for 100k ENG tokens per year that these can mine.

Pricing for all ongoing services (as opposed to initial setup) on Steem-Engine.com will be moving to a pricing model where you have to stake ENG in order for the services to continue operating.  If you own the ENG you'll soon be able to delegate it to projects that need the staked ENG to continue operating.  We'll be working with leasing sites to get a leasing marketgoing.

## What do I have to do mine ENG?

All you have to do is buy the EM token or the EMFOUR token, stake it,  and it'll start mining.  You'll get ENG delivered into your account that you can claim.

To unstake it'll take 4 weeks and return 1/4 of what you unstake each week.  Delegation isn't live yet but should be live this month.

## Price

I've put 10000 EM and 10000 EMFOUR up for sale.  EM costs 100 steem.  EMFOUR costs 300 Steem, but mines 4X better than the EM token can.

EDIT I've taken it down to 1000 EMFOUR.
