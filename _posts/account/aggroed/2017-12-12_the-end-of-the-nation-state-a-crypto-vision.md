I founded the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network.  I didn't just stumble across those three words randomly.  I've spent many years and gone through a touch of hell to figure out some basic truths that I observe about the world.  The current system is broken.  Or, more precisely, the current system is working perfectly in it's design, but the current design leaves much to be desired for the vast majority of people.  When I look at the scoreboard I see 1% of the population has 90% of the wealth, and literally 8 people/families have as much wealth as over 3 Billion people.  Those 8 people are not 10^9 better or more valuable than any of those in the lower 3B people group.  What has happened is that an economic system was successfully implemented that funnelled wealth from the poorest to the system creators and those system creators are now the wealthiest people around.

Now, funnelling wealth isn't always a bad thing.  Capital should go where it needs to, but there are a few problems here.  The first is that this capital is coerced.  Taxation is theft, or to George Bushize it Taxification is theftication.  People get in the middle of your daily commerce and say you can't exchange that piece of bread for the unit of exchange unless you give us a portion of that unit of exchange.  If you don't we'll arrest you and throw you in prison.  How is that not theft?  Just because lots of people agreed it's ok to take what's yours doesn't mean it isn't theft.

So, the first problem is that the wealth is funneled under duress, and the second problem is how they use it.  A recent survey reported that the USG is considered the largest threat to peace in the world.  No wonder... we're bombing 7 countries right now.  And that military industrial complex is expensive.  Roughly 70% of all taxes paid (at least the ones officially on the books) go to pay a military budget.  Essentially money you invest under duress in government services has a 70% overhead for the military.  That seems like a bad investment.

So, my first issue with the world as it stands is vast sucking sound of the banking and government complex absorbing wealth from the poor and middle class and then further making it worse by spending it on violent projects.  To make matters even worse from that they have further increased spending and their projects into the realm of a massive spy net.  Programs like the intelligence agencies are recording your calls, keeping your dic pics, and categorically tracking all the things you say and do on the internet.

## But Aggroed... I have nothing to hide, so I'm ok with that.  <h2>

That's a really short sighted view of this.  Just because it's not cool to persecute you for something that you do now doesn't mean that they won't come after you later.  Maybe marajuana legalization goes south and all those pictures of you and some blunts lands you in prison.  Maybe you studied cryptos.  What if government starts watching how nearly every fiat dollar in the world is discarded for crypto and decides to outlaw it to protect the monopoly they've created.  There's thousands of pages of laws on the books, and these aren't designed to enhance your freedom, but to extract wealth from you and keep you under tight control

So, what's my point... the world as it stands is a bit of shitshow of violence, theft, and a giant spynet, and that's why the world needs crypto.  This thing has the power to bring down the nation state.

## Woah, that's a big leap, how tf did you get there? <h2>

The governments rely not only on taxes, but on an entire economic system.  After world war II the Bretton Woods Accords made the USD the world reserve currency.  All transactions now have to go through the USD.  For 60 years this has forced other nations to accept USDs.  At the very start this may have been good for nations and trade, but what has happened is the USG has been printing paper and forcing other nations to return goods and services for printed paper.  That's not an equal exchange of wealth.  We print shit out of thin air, and you give us all of your natural resources.  That's a bad trade.

Now, once you have the ability to print money at a whim and force the world to accept it you can do shit like grow a massive military budget that's both on and off the books.  And you can use that military to enforce the rule that other nations have to accept our dollars.  While the general sentiment is that the wars currently fought are over oil, and I don't quite disagree I would put them in the larger context of the US is picking off enemies that voice concern or act out of line with the world reserve currency enforcement.

## My central point buried this far down <h2>

Out of all the things that nations truly rely on it's the creation of money that now puts them squarely in charge.  They inflate it, loan it to their friends, use it to build militaries and spy networks, and basically put up a giant control grid around all of us.  One of the first steps to removing this power is creating an alternative to it.  Finally we not only have an alternative, but a really fucking good one.  

Cryptos go through artifical state boundaries like a hot knife through butter.  Cryptos work quickly.  Cryptos usually don't have 1/1000th the inflation of fiat dollars.  Cryptos are generally decentralized rather than centralized.  Basically all the shit that makes government fiat money bad for everyday people has been undone by the nature and design of cryptocurrencies.  These are a force for good(s)!

## bitcoin at 16k <h2>

The fact that bitcoin is at 16k shows the utility of this alternative currency type, and it's a combination of the dollar losing value and cryptos gaining value that makes it so freaking appealing.  This baby has been on a 1% gain per day curve for a few years now.  That's the opposite of government dollars that lose value every single day.  I'm personally trying to remove as much wealth from fiat dollars to put into crypto currencies as possible.  Buy a few coins today and spend them in a few years to buy my house.  That's the power of a healthy currency, and as people switch from these government systems that steal wealth to do bad thing I'm looking forward to seeing a a future that looks different.


## What does the future look like? <h2>

I see a world where the governments themselves have been nuetered.  Where these bastards can no longer steal and cause harm.  Where the spying and the theft are curtailed and where people are free.

I see a cryptopunk world forming out there.  Instead of the violence, theft, and spying I see a world filled with peace, abundance, and liberty.  Instead of a world where my daughters and I are molested if we want to cross an artificial line on the map I see open borders, free trade, and no one intruding in my commerce.  I see a world where centralized military forces have no place.  I see a world where I'm free to exist so long as I cause no harm.

I'm happy to be on this journey with you, and thanks for changing the world around us with me!
