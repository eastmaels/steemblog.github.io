So, I was recently able to visit the Libertarian National Convention and give a talk there.  I gave a working title of making money with Steemit.  I didn't get a chance to fix that, and it was printed that way.  There wasn't a huge audience for the discussion, but Ernie Hancock came and he has a pretty strong following of Libertarians.  I have a conversation with him on Thursday and hopefully we'll get his base more amped up about Steem.  Anyway, I gave a talk so here is the talk slides and a quick gist

## Spreading Peace, Abundance, and Liberty on the Steem Blockchain

Intro Slide

How I got started - Facebook kept shadow banning me by making me identify friends on memes where it was impossible.

The origin story of my name

I wasn't immediately successful here!

I was helped by @kaylinart and @fyrstikken and learned how Steem can spread abundance.

That was an important lesson because the things I was fighting as an internet activist was war, poverty, and spying.  This seems to be a perfect antidote.

This is what I figured out. Steem is a fantastic tool to spread the message.

What is a blockchain?  Blocks hold data, and the chain puts it together.

What's in a block?

What did I start working on?

I was elected to help spread this message.

I'm working on a backdoor way to onboard people.  Come for a game, stay for the community.

With the blockchain you can earn through coding, creative projects, and normal business transactions.  Steem makes it easier than other places.

## We'll see where it goes

Hopefully it was worth the trip to head down there.  I'll find out more when I talk to Ernie on his show on Thursday at 9am EST.
