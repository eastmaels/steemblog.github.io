It's time for another update on the Witness stuff!  Hooray!   I've got some great news and some bad news that you've likely been feeling.  So, let's try to lay this stuff out there for you.

## The big announcement! <h2>

Just received my 400th Witness vote.  The total puts me the tiniest bit away from the top 50 witnesses where the minnows can finally click once and not enter, click off, reenter, reclickoff my name over and over again as they attempt to vote my witness.  It's a big deal.  I'm catching roughly 24 blocks a day so one every hour.  It's a giant honor to help assemble the blockchain.  Thanks for your support!  I'd list everyone, but 400 people seems a little much ;)

I think my ideals of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, and my promise to growth hack Steemit and help new users continues to resonate, and I'll will continue with that agenda!

## 1.  SEGWIT <h2>

yeah, so money stuff first.  You probably noticed some sinking crypto prices around here.  Segwit is on the horizon for August.  Even a Segwit 2 which may happen later if they get their shit together.  It leads to uncertainly, uncertainly increases risk, risk drops price.  So, your crypto assests are sinking.  If you think that segwit will fail and won't integrate like it did with LTC then you should probably sell.  If you think they will be successful then you should probably buy and think of the dip as a sale price.

## 2.  Rewardpool <h2>

We're under 800k of steem for the reward pool.  It was over 1.6M during HF18.  It's still sinking.  I'm not entirely sure where this place will equilabrate, but it's getting lower.  That's not good.  Especially with so many people upvoting their own comments putting extra drain it seems to keep sinking.  I just wish someone had prominently displayed some concerns over HF19 before it was launched... So, for now you'll peak within 24 hrs and unless you're catching late whales to the party expect your rewards to go down until equilibrium is finally achieved.  Between the shrunk pool and Segwit uncertainty it definately hurts me in my dolphin ballz.  Oh, well, don't sell and if price goes back up it won't matter a month from now or so.

## 3.  The Minnow Support Project should reach 3,000 people in the discord Channel today or tomorrow!!! <h2>

Yeah, this unreal accomplishment has happened!  It only took us 2 years, scratch that, 1 year, scratch that, 6 months, scratch that, 30 days!  Yep in 30 days we've hit 3,000 unique users.  We have a website about to be launched thanks to @crimsonclad and @followbtcnews, we have a radio show platform thanks to @sircork and I'll mention that in a second.  We also have 6-8 curation projects running around in the Discord room and overall we've received roughly 140,000 delegated SP for them from 200 delegations.  It's been pretty insane to watch as roughly every day we get another 1,000 SP delegated or so now.  

If you're interested in delegating to the Minnow Support Projects or it's baby projects please use this app by @netuoso and watch out for the MOAB (mother of all bots) to come out soon.

You can also see the 200 delegations that have happened inside the Minnow Support Group.  While it isn't close to half the delegated steem I'm pretty sure that half of all delegations on the platform are for MSP related projects!  So, feelin' pretty pimp about that!

## 4. MSPWAVES <h2>

We're building a radio station inside the Minnow Support Project Discord group!  We'll stream through Twitch and put it out into the world!  Should be fun.  We have 300+ Steemians in the channel around the clock now, so hopefully you can come in, rope some up, and put on a show.  You'll get your name out there and hopefully folks will gain some great knowledge.  Check out mspwaves.com and register there.  Once you're promoted to DJ you can self service your time slot and post to the general account @msp-waves.  We'll provide more updates, but the radio shows will start for real in August.  Hopefully you're one of them.

## 5. Boston Meetup <h2>

In case you missed it I'm hosting a meetup in Boston with my buddy @justtryme90!  We'll be at knight moves in Brookline on Tuesday August 1st at 6:30pm.  Come join us.  There's over 100 SBD in prizes.  Might also do a delegation while I'm there.  We'll see.  Should be fun!

## 6. HF 20: Velocity <h2>
The steemitblog posted about HF20 almost as soon as they the chain stabilized after HF19.  HF20 will introduce tokens as a way to create new users instead of using steem.  I'm totally for that, but it mentioned possibly bringing back mining.  That sounds like a horrible idea to me.  After I wrote the Who is @freedom post I've been thinking mining is a serious risk to worsening the distribution and technocracy here.  I would think it's better to do a witness style voting thing, but open it up to 2,000 people or so.  Let the block decide who should have the most tokens.  We should ask the witnesses not to participate since they are already getting compensation for what they do on the platform.  I'll take in some feedback from this post before I do a more major piece describing my reaction to it.

## In case you missed it MSP sent @siersod to STEEMFEST <h2>

Be sure to send him some love and congrats!  He wants to work on simplifying the interface for steemit and helping the ongoing food crisis in Venezuela.  2 much needed things for sure!

## Witness settings <h2>
I haven't changed anything since I put up HF 19.  Yes the price of SBDs has dipped below a dollar.  If it happens or worsens the witnesses will likely react.  It's not an immediate kind of thing though since the market reacts fast and knows we will intervene if we have to.  For now it's stable enough and just being a hair below a $1 isn't enough to freak people out into action... yet.

## Comments delayed <h2>
Going back to work so my comments will be delayed, but I'll read through them tonight and will respond the best I can.  I'm grateful for the support of the people that upvote my witness.  I'm so effin' close to top 50 it's insane.  Please vote for me if you haven't already.  Thanks to the MSP witnesses, mods, delegators, and members.  There are hundreds of you and the growth of the team is a testament to what you do!  

With Love,

Aggy
