As promised I said I would increase my delegation to @msp-active to 10k.  I just did that tonight.  It was up from 5,000 when I started the account.  I had to wait until some of the personal delegations I had removed came back to me.

## auto-votes <h2>

I've put a number of people onto auto-votes.  These are folks that are active in PALnet, chilling in radio shows on msp-waves, or helping in other ways.  If you're not getting these votes and you think that you should contact me in Discord.  Put together a 1-2 sentence pitch on what value you offer to the Minnow Support Project Community housed in the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Discord channel and I'll evaluate.

## Vote Ranges <h2>

Most of the voting percentages are between 5-25%.  The highest I think I'm doing is 50%.  While the vote percentages are indeed a little small it's worth noting that the account voting power is currently hovering around 98%.  So, it's a smaller vote with a stronger overall account vote power.

## General rules <h2>

An occasional shit post isn't the worst thing ever, especially for a minnow, but if you are found to continue to put out low quality content to take advantage of the auto votes I'm removing you from it.

If you're putting out content that advocate for violence I'll take you off of it.

If you get banned from PALnet I'll take you off of it.

This is my SP.  I'm doing this as a service.  I reserve the right to end the service if people seem to treat the benefit with disrespect.

## Next set of delegations <h2>

I'm at 8k active SP now.  I'd like to be closer to 15k.  I'm going to build up my VP to not only 15k, but then add another 5k on top.  When I get to 20k I'll delegate 1-5k to one of the major projects within MSP.  I'll continue adding more and more SP into projects through July/August.  Then I'm going to shave off some, start powering down more, and try to catch what seems to be the annual pump in December.  I'll try to buy back in for even more stake in Jan/Feb and then delegate to higher amounts than I have previously.

The four accounts I plan on pumping are msp-mods, msp-curation, msp-active, and msp-waves.  The primary account @minnowsupport has 18k SP on it that's organic and another 100k that's delegated to it.  As long as the other 4 accounts are underneath the amount of organic SP on the mothership account I plan on increasing delegations to those.

## 2 ways to have enough <h2>

You can constantly strive for more wealth to fill an ever larger and upward level of greed or you can be content with what you have and own.  I'm going for the latter.  My family has enough to live a comfortable existence.  The goal is to spread abundance, and that means helping others.  I'm planning to be in this for the long haul and helping to build a better world and I'll put my SP to the task to do that.  Thank you for your support.  

## Witness Votes <h2>

Sorry to keep shilling my Witness.  I know that many people support me and I'm fortunate to be a top 20 witness.  Recently I've moved down from rank 7 to 11.  It's important to stick with the campaign so that I can continue to provide revenue towards the mission of the Minnow Support Project-  Spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, help the Steem ecosystem grow, and train and retain minnows (new members) on the platform.

If you think those goals and my approach to them are worth please consider voting for me if you haven't already.
