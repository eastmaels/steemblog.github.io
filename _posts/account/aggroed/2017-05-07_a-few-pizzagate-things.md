Jeff Epstein is a bad guy.  Orgy island is likely a honeytrap for powerful people.  I'm sure the whole island is cameraed and bugged.  So, you go down thinking you're going to have a good time, come to find out you've been drugged, and while drugged you did some bad things with some underaged people.  Now you have to do the shit that the Orgy Island people tell you or you're going to be exposed.

As it turns out Trump is also mired in that swamp.  Ben Fulford claims he murdered and raped some girl down there.

So, I mostly think that Trump isn't one of the "good guys," but who knows.  He's invading Syria which is bad news to me, but could be good if he's killing Daesh/ISIS.  It's bad if he's just killing brown people for oil like the last 30 years of presidents.  In good news pedo arrests are happening.

So, who knows, maybe he's doing good.  At the very least someone is doing some good.  I think that's over 3k pedo and sex traffickers that have been arrested.  Eventually the people that think pizzagate is fake news are going to have to come to terms with the fact that pedos have been arrested all over the "globe" (in quotes for my flat earther friends).
