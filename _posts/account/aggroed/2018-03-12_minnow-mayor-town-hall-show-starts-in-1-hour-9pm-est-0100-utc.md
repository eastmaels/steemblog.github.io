Ok, first off I'm pretty excited to share a brand new intro to the show that @hardikv put together.  This is a pretty bad ass little intro if I do say so myself.  The music is by @soundwavesphoton and the video work, which is new, is by @hardikv.

I'd like you guys to make some comments about it and see if you think it's as cool as I think it is.

## Guests tonight <h2>

I have @leecamp scheduled to be here.  He's the RT host of Redacted Tonight.  We'll see if he's able to attend or remember.  I gave him a reminder 5 min ago... so, we'll see if that's enough.

## Might get a few performers <h2>

I'm always happy to invite people onto the show that want to perform something.  it can be a song, skit, section of a play or reading.  I don't care.  You can share some art you created and talk about it with us.  I'm open to exploring the creative side of this platform with the time that we have available.

## Delegation <h2>

I don't really do personal delegations anymore, but there's 11k SP sitting on msp-active.  So, if you're regularly attending radio shows on msp-waves you can get added to this (or just by being active in PALnet Discord)

## Dice Bitches <h2>

We'll play dice for 25SBD

1.  I roll
2.  You roll
3.  If you beat or tie me move onto the next round.  If you don't then STOP ROLLING!
4.  Last person standing with a higher number than me will win the money.  
5.  If I win once we start over, if I win twice I'm gonna give it to a Moderator at random.

How to roll
`t!dice 10d10` in the first round
`t!dice 9d9` in the second round

## Logistics <h2>

Just hop into [the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel](minnowpond.org)  we can direct you from there.  If you haven't joined before start by registering.  If you have joined before than hop into the mspwaves-audience channel.
