Sorry for the relatively short post.  Today has been a little hectic split between dadding, monstering, msping, and witnessing.  I meant to get this post out earlier, but I took a half day off and rode roller coasters with my first baby for the first time and took my 2nd baby on large water park slides for the first time.  Then stuff...

Anyway, MMTH is tonight.  I think I'm gonna skip some Steem Monsters tonight and go back to the original format at least for a night.  I'm hoping folks will come on air with me and just openly discuss stuff they are working on, posts they want to share or read excerpts from, and a who knows what else...  Wanna perform?  ok.  Wanna talk witness stuff?  Ok.  Want to talk about MSP?  Ok.  Want to introduce yourself to the platform. I'll help.

## Logistics

Show starts in 40 minutes in the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord group](https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw).  Hop into the msp-waves audience channel to chat.
