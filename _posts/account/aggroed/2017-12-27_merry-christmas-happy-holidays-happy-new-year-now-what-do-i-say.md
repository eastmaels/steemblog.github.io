So, I just had a lovely evening this evening with friends that I've known for a few years as part of muh wife's moms group.  They are lovely people.  Our kids play together.  Their kids are funny, smart, and friendly.  The adults are kind, hard working, thoughtful and funny.  I just don't know what to say to them anymore.

I can say the seasonal things.  I can ask for carrots and peas politely.  I can ask how they are feeling, but it's hard to engage these days in conversation.  All I want to do is sit around and tell them about crypto.  I mean.  I did that, but it's not nice to overwhelm people with this for hours.  It's probably in their best long term interest... but that doesn't mean that they want to hear it at the seasonal party.

**subtitle- what the fuck is this guy talking about?!?**

Literally just about everything I'm doing is either hanging with my family or poured back into Steem.  I like it because it's financially rewarding and simultaneously it brings me life satisfaction to work on providing an alternative to the status quo that basically sucks for everyone on the planet right now.

"Did you know that the Federal Reserve is a private bank, and that private bank doesn't act like it's under the jurisdiction of the government?  Please pass the peas.  Did you know that the government you think is a government is actually a corporation that's claiming to represent the original de jure government?  Also, that government doesn't really have any rights over you either because all of these relationships involve voluntary contracts that you never voluntarily signed under full disclosure?  Pass the butter?"

I can't act normally with normal people anymore.  I'm trying to balance talking about what I care about and current social norms.  I don't worry about these things on the daily, but when I'm representing my family in normal society I'm a little at a loss.  I don't want to hurt relationships with my kids friends by being THAT GUY at the dinner table.

It's not to say that I don't promote these things in public with the fiat normies too!  But I am trying to balance it being the only thing that I care about and try to have a range of discussion that feels inclusive to others at the table.

"So, how bout them Pats distracting you from the Fed crushing the economy?"  I think I still need some work.
