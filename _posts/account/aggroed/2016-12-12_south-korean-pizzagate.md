<p>Yep. &nbsp;All you statist boot licking America worshipers who refuse to look at the actions of elected officials as opposed to rhetoric of elected officials will be stunned to find out that another President has gone down. &nbsp;Their crime? &nbsp;Being associated with a satanic cult and letting demonic sources take them over. &nbsp;Yes, I get it, it sounds like an Onion article. &nbsp;No the tech savvy Koreans didn't suddenly become ridiculously cult afraid overnight... They had data that pointed to their leader being part of a global satanic cult and got her taken down... just like you see happening in the US. &nbsp;Norway, Australia, and billion other places. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This story involves gay sex too. &nbsp;Gays aren't bad. &nbsp;Predators are bad. &nbsp;These people tend to be gay, child predators on top of their satanism.<br>
<br>
This world is run by satanic pedos. &nbsp;The faster you come to grips with that and fight for people who don't worship satan or fuck kids the better and healthier our society will be. &nbsp;You also have to work on a personal 10 step detox program to get all that shit they've brainwashed you with out of your head. &nbsp;This world needs a makeover, and you should participate by cleaning your own stall first.<br>
