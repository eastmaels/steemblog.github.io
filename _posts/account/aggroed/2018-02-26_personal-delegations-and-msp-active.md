So, I've removed a bunch of personal delegations from people.  I chose not to remove all of them all at once.  I'm going to do this in a few phases.  I've created an account called @msp-active.  For the people I removed delegations from I then turned around and added them to @msp-active autovotes.  You'll get a maximum of 3 posts per day that you'll still receive votes from the bot on.  

## How'd I do the voting percent? <h2>

Ok,  this is still an experimental stage.  I've gone through and started by how much SP I removed I turned into a delegation of a certain percent.  Then I found out who are the most active chatters in PALnet.  Then I added them to the autovoter.  Then I went through and started tracking down people in General Deepend that I thought have been pretty active.  I was extra kind to @minnowsupport delegators, also to greeters, and people that spend time on msp-waves shows or ops.  I'd like to support people that listen to the radio frequently too.  They'll get autovotes as well.

## I probably didn't get everyone right the first pass <h2>

If you feel slighted that you were missed, feel like the percent is wrong, or would like to petition me for more VP from this bot then go ahead.  I'm in PALnet.  You can catch me there.  Don't just say "hi" wait for me to respond, and then dive into why you think you should get more.  Please respect that I'm doing a lot of things and follow this advice:  Make a 1 sentence pitch and leave that for me.  That's it.  No "hi" no "how ya doin" skip the small talk and let's get to the meat of it.  I'm probably gonna have to do this 20 times so... it would be helpful.

There are a handful of people that should be on there, but I don't know their Steem names.  So, hopefully they'll see this and chime in too.

## Why did I do this? <h2>

I initially said that I'd give the delegations until someone reached 5k SP.  Then I said I'd do it for 6 months.  But I got very frustrated when I saw people with my delegations go inactive or send their proceeds to Bittrex.  I felt pretty betrayed.  So, I'm shrinking delegations even from folks that probably don't deserve it, and starting the msp-active account with 5k SP.  The delegations I clawed back I'll toss back into the account in a week or so.  My plan is to get the account to at least 10k SP.  Should happen in March or April.

So, yeah, you lost some delegation, you gained some extra autovotes, I get peace of mind that it's not going to inactive accounts, and now I care a little less if you're just selling stuff off to Bittrex.  In a month or two I'll come back and skim more off the delegations.  By the end of the year all of the personal delegations will be gone and I'll just tweak how much VP folks get from msp-active.  I'll keep delegating to this who knows.  It may be 20k by the end of the year.

## I want these autovotes what do I do? <h2>

Follow @minnowsupport, join the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Discord Channel](minnowpond.org), and listen to msp-waves.  I'll be adding and upping people over time.  If you'd like bigger votes consider delegating to @minnowsupport or performing some routine services for the Minnow Support Project.
