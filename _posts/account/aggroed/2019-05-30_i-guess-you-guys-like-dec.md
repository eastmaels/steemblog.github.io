Was trolling around with the bot that @danielsaori made for @steemmonsters.  I was pretty happy to see that the market for cards has never been hotter, there's new cards available through orbs, and you can get the orbs through DEC which you can earn through fighting.

Matt's the genius behind DEC.  No doubt the reward pool for fighting was his idea.  It's brilliant.  The guy's a savant.  Clearly we're not the only ones that think so because you guys are buying and trading thousands of dollars worth of DEC every day,  gettin' da potions, and scoring some sweet loot.

Tomorrow is season end day.  I'm pretty excited to see the activity tomorrow.  I bet that too is an ATH just like the sweet sweet chart above.

Do you even monster brah?
