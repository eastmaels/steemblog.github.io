Building community is one of the most important things we can do as a community.  It's no wonder that the ultimate Steemit community building event, Steemfest, and the number 1 witness on the list, @roelandp, go hand in hand.  And regardless of whether you're motivated for financial, professional, or social reasons growing steemit.  If you want a higher value for steemit then grow the community.  If you want a better world than grow the community.  Growing this community person by person is going to reward us and help us make changes we want to see.

## 1.  Post a story about what makes steemit better than other social media sites on those social media sites. <h2>

I wrote an article about having made a pretty decent amount of steem after posting heavily for a week.  I left it on my facebook wall where I have about 1000 followers there.  You know... get paid and don't get censored.  It's a pretty nice deal, and that's helpful to the community without even leaving my armchair.

## 2.  Connect with others online. <h2>
Discord and Steemit chat are two great places to meet other steemers.  Look, people do business with people they know.  If you're fishing for a whale vote it's a lot easier if you know them, interact with them, and have thoughtful things to say other than "please upvt my cammint."  So, don't just write your article and walk off hoping that people will read it and care about it.  You gotta meet people!

@fyrstikken has a great group called steemspeak on discord.  They discuss just about everything.  Politics, crypto, life.  It all gets covered.

@officialfuzzy has a whale shares discord group now.  If you want to meet some of the whales behind whale shares that will exchange upvotes and eventually resteems for bitshare tokens called whaleshares then you'll want to head over to that group and at the very least lurk around and see what's up.  I got 5 whale upvotes last night just for hanging around.  Depending on the whale that could be as much as $50.  Again, it's socially and financially rewarding.

You can find them here.  https://discord.gg/GykFB6S  There's about 100 people in there from what I can tell.

I just put together a discord group too focused on peace, abundance, and liberty call PALnet.   If you're interested in connecting with other folks that aren't happy with immoral banksters that run the world you might find some like minded friends in there.

You can find us here: https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw

## 3.  You can reach out to other communities. <h2>
@ausbitbank just worked out a great thing for the community.  Check this post out: https://steemit.com/steem/@ausbitbank/livingroomofsatoshi-confirms-they-are-adding-steem-to-aud-bank-deposit-and-bpay-payments

He got another exchange to plan on building in the functionality to trade steem.  That's a whole new group of people that are going to get exposed to this place.

## 4.  Go into the community and talk to people about Steemit <h2>

Here's a neat article by @swolesome about one approach to getting folks just in public places to learn more about us and why we're here.  He's also runner up for this week's Minnow Support Project.

## Bonus Tip <h2>

Don't be a jerk online.  Steemit has a strong reputation economy too.  Be sure to be kind and helpful to others and watch as your followers grow!
