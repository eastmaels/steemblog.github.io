<p>Make Funny. &nbsp;It's a simple command. &nbsp;There are lots of ways to be funny, but being a smart ass is my specialty. &nbsp;I have burning need to write, a burning need to fix the world, and a burning need to expose some of the truths that I research. &nbsp;I can't think of a better way to lampoon the wrongs by having fun expressing them than by creating satire.</p>
<p>"But Aggroed, the world is already soaked in satire! &nbsp;Don't you know that? &nbsp;We don't need you!" said every hater ever!</p>
<p>Yes, I am aware that may have been true, but when Jon Stewart left the podium to pursue the ring, many were left voiceless. &nbsp;I thought we could turn to the onion, but then<a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/hillarys-top-donor-buys-onion-starts-publishing-propaganda-immediately/"> it was purchased by a long time HRC supporter</a> and started spewing propaganda rather than satire. It's been a rough year for satire.</p>

<p>What can you expect? &nbsp;I will seek out and destroy all mainstream opinions. &nbsp;I will blast mainstream media. &nbsp;I will lampoon all of the positions of the various parties. &nbsp;I will take arguments to illogical extremes to highlight their idiocy. &nbsp;I will mock just about anything that seems to have merit as having different legit positions that aren't being discussed or absurdity is discussed when thoughtful options are present. &nbsp;I will attempt to spare no idiot for as long as I post.</p>

<p>I have strong Libertarian views, but I also believe people do better things when they work together.</p>
<p>If you're looking for news, entertainment, and something thought provoking all I can say is "Welcome Aboard!"</p>
