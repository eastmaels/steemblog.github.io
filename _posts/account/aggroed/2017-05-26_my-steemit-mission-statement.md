If you don't know what direction you're headed in then every time you are presented with a decision the answer will be unclear.  A simple and meaningful way to set your direction is write a clear Mission Statement.  Nearly every single business out there has one of these.  And, believe it or not, your blog here is also a business.  Your followers are customers that pay for your content with their upvotes, resteems, and attention.

So, I've been here since September.  That means 8 months.  This account is nearing $10k, and I'll surpass that in 6 days when I drop a BTC worth of steem into this account.  I have over 800 followers, which puts me in the top 150 most followed authors.  I have over 1000 posts.  I've built steemd once already, so I'm getting some programming experience.  I have several whales that follow me.  I think people would recognize my name in the discord channel.  Someone even called me Steemit famous.  I think I finally have a real sense of this place.  I think it's time to clarify my mission here.

## Mission comes from purpose <h2>
And purpose comes from passion.  I work in higher education.  I really love young people.  I want to help them.  I'm particularly aware of the fact that I've been blessed by having an upper middle class upbringing, which has included really fantastic schools.  I think it's a great travesty how shitty our education system is and how many of the university students I've taught over the years have been woefully under prepared.  Also, when they leave school they are in crippling debt.

So, I devote my life to education elsewhere.  I plan to do it here too.  And I'm not just talking about courses and formal shit.  I really mean about learning.  Yes the intellectual light bulbs getting illuminated on a kid are awesome, but I really like the personal connection of when a student learns a life lesson too.

## What about the platform? <h2>
In my non-higher education life I've come to realize that the world is run by immoral banksters.  Every second of every day when I work, pay bills, use credit cards, and all this financial stuff I'm supporting the thing that gives them power.  The ability to create $16T overnight out of thin air is an incredible power, and it's one they use maliciously.  

So, I like steemit.  I finally have an option for how I want to engage in commerce that allows me sleep at night knowing that these actions don't contribute to violence.  I think Steemit is one amazing option to throw sand in the eyes of the powers that be and help turn the tide to a better world.  I have issues with this place, like the distribution, but I'm planning on helping it grow and spread.  I think it's one of the best tools in my toolbox right now and I'm grateful for that.

## We all have the spark of god within us <h2>
I'm a man of science, but at some point the amazing nature of universe has called me to a spiritual place too.  Call it god, call it love, call it the force, or call it the great pumpkin spirit.  We all have it inside of us.  Violence done to another is very much violence done to oneself.  We're all creator gods locked in meat sacks, and I'm honestly not even convinced that's there's more than one entity on this Earth with a touch of essence spread into each vessel.  So, I want peace for all.  Abundance for all.  And Liberty for all.  We're all one... what else should we want?  That's it.

## So, how does this translate to a mission statement? <h2>
As a blogger on steemit I intend to spread peace, abundance, and liberty.  I'll help educate people on this platform in terms of the technical use, social use, and values embodied by it's community.  I will help spread this platform, the knowledge of it's users, and the power of it's currency beyond it's current capacity.  I'll grow as a an author to inspire other writers, to show them the ropes, and create a warm welcome whenever possible.  I'll grow as a person and continue to develop programming skills so that I can contribute to more aspects of this platform.  And I'll do my best to give back more to this platform than it gives to me.  

In the next month or two I'm going to try a witness run.  Hopefully you'll support me there too.

## I'm incredibly grateful to you, and I'll try not to let you down.  <h2>

I'm touched by how many people I get to interact with here.  I'm learning as much as I can as quickly as I can.  I hope I can support you in some way as I know you're helping me.

You can find me lurking on steemspeak, a discord channel that many steemers use to text and talk to each other- https://discord.gg/qjpRj7w
I can also be found on steemchat as @aggroed.  If you have a post to share give me a good sentence or two of why you think Iâ€™ll like it.
