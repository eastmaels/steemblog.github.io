<p>So, turns out that patient dismissal for vaccine refusal is a thing. &nbsp;Not only is it a thing, but there are peer reviewed <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2532570/">articles </a>about it.</p>
<p>So, a parent watches <a href="http://vaxxedthemovie.com/stream/">Vaxxed </a>and realizes that the evidence that the CDC produces to claim that vaccines are safe and good is based on completely fraudulent data. &nbsp;The data that it not only causes autism, but seems to do so in higher rates for boys and very specifically black boys is completely 'whitewashed.' &nbsp;The parent then goes into the doctors office and tells the doctor I don't think this is safe, and then they are dropped from the practice.</p>
<p>See it turns out that doctors make a crap ton of money off of vaccinating their patients. &nbsp;For every fully vaccinated patient the doctor will make $400. &nbsp;That's a fair amount of incentive, but that's not the end of it.</p>
<p><img src="https://wellnessandequality.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/bcbs_providerincentiveprogram1.png?w=840" width="592" height="579"/></p>
<p>Do you see that "Target:COMM" it stands for target commission rate. &nbsp;So, in order to get paid out the $400 his patients have to have a 63% complete vaccination rate (that includes the flu vaccine). &nbsp;So, let's assume that you have a practice that has <a href="http://medcitynews.com/2014/02/many-patients-primary-care-physician-care/">1000 patients</a>. &nbsp;If 63% of them are vaccinated the doctor will receive $252,000. &nbsp;If 61% of them are vaccinated they will receive $0. &nbsp;This has two very direct effects.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Doctors have an absurdly large financial incentive to drive vaccines within their practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Doctors have an even larger incentive to drop patients that don't vaccinate.</p>
<p>(3). The more subtle implication is that doctors have no financial incentive to question vaccines. &nbsp;</p>
<p>They also don't face any consequences if things go badly. &nbsp;They don't have any liability for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;There is this thing called the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123535050056344903">National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</a>. &nbsp;It shields doctors and pharma companies from any liability. &nbsp;There is a <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/06/23/vaccine-injury-data.aspx">secret court</a> that handles all of the vaccine injury cases. &nbsp;You're thinking, ok so how big of a deal could that possibly be right? &nbsp;Vaccines are safe and this thing is probably never used...</p>
<p><img src="https://s4.postimg.org/4l70gyld9/vaccine_court_amount.jpg" width="812" height="504"/></p>
<p>$3 Billion.</p>
<p>That's a lot of lives that have been shattered. &nbsp;Who knows how many doctors have turned their patients away from this or didn't have a clue about it. &nbsp;Who knows how many ways the pharma companies or the courts have squirriled out of paying families money that need medical intervention as a result of the dangerous vaccines.</p>
<p>So, even though nurses and doctors refuse vaccines for their family at higher rates than the non-medical population they still administer them. &nbsp;I'm not sure I could cash a $250k check knowing that I've caused irreparable harm to children in my practice, but I don't have to worry about it because I'm not faced with that choice.</p>
<p>If you're a parent and you know that the CDC lies about vaccine safety, a secret court pays out billions in damages, your doctor is financially incentivized to inject your family, and that doctor bears no personal risk if it's dangerous are you still planning on vaccinating?</p>
