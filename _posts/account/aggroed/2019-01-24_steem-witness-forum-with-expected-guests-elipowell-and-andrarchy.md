![Witness Forum.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmaRdp7k9ww6ZErWXZ4RrFfLpBDBxLoJHwDc77xW9jGsim/Witness%20Forum.png)

This Saturday at 10am EST (1500 UTC) I'm hosting the Steem Witness Forum.  @elipowell and @andrarchy from Steemit have agreed to come on.  There's been a lot of big news this week and I hope they'll give some perspective on it and this will give @elipowell a great opportunity to continue introducing herself as the newly appointed managing director of Steemit to the Steem community.

Multiple Top 20 witnesses have agreed to come on air.  We'll see what the final count looks like, but so far yabapmatt, followbtcnews, and a few others are tentative.

We have a few backup witnesses that have asked to come on.

@fredrikaa - representing @steempress
@llfarms - Represeting @c-squared and currently working group chair for Steem Alliance
@krnel - A long time Steemian

## Show Format

Steemit typically comes on first and provides us with some perspective of what they have going on.  After 30-45 minutes they stay on the call if they choose, but it's witnesses that lead the discussion.  If you have questions you'd like to ask Steemit please leave comments below and I'll try to incorporate them.

After Steemit has gone I try to ask open ended questions, usually informed by the previous discussion, of what different witnesses think is the right direction for the platform.  I give prompts and they're given a chance to answer.

## Logistics

The Show occurs in the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel](minnowpond.org).

The show starts at 10am est.

The show is broadcast on mspwaves.com/listen and there will be a vimm link provided.

The show is recorded and anyone is welcome to record and post the show on their own as well.
