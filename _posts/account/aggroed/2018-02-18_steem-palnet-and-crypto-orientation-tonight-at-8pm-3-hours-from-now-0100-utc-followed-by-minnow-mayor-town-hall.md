I really love Steem.  I love this ecosystem.  I love this community. I love the wealth it generates investors and content creators, but that said... it's really freaking hard to figure out.  So, every so often I run an orientation.  Today is one of those days.  

If you're new here, and there's lots of you, and you want to know "How to Steem" then come join us in Discord or watch online at mspwaves.com/listen.  I'll walk folks through how to use the platform, what to do here, how to grow your account or your business, how to get a community, and tools that exist to help new users.

## Minnow Mayor Town Hall <h2>

Once I'm done with the orientation I'll kinda reboot the show during the broadcast and turn it into the Town Hall format.  What's this?  Well, anyone on the platform (who hasn't been banned from the Discord server) is welcome to join me and talk about whatever they would like.  I'm happy to conduct an interview on the fly, but you're welcome to perform if you're a musician, you can read some work as a blogger, you can introduce yourself to the Discord/MSP-Waves community, you can ask me questions, or you can literally just hang out.  Whatever.  It's open format and just a way for you to promote yourself or project.

## Logistics <h2>

We have a Discord Server.  Discord is a modern day internet chatroom that has voice and video capability.  You can join us by going to minnowpond.org.  It'll reroute you to the Discord server.  If you're brand new check out this screenshot.

Oh, and once you register you can use our server to get a vote from @minnowsupport once every 24 hours.  It's not a ton of money, but it's a great way to start building steem for brand new accounts.

## Dice Bitches <h2>

We play a game called dice bitches.  I'll roll dice using the `t!dice 10d10` command.  If you tie my roll or beat it you can go onto the next round where I'll use the `t!dice 9d9` command.

The game is rigged and I'll often win.  So, if I win once we'll start over from scratch.  If I win twice in a row then I'll send the cash prize of 25SBD to @minnowsupport.

Well, hopefully I'll see you in 3 hours!  I'll be there to answer any questions and help you figure this place out!  It's like my Steem office hours!
