WOOT!  I'm thrilled!  It's been 9 days so far that we've had that space open to everyone and we've reached 1,000 unique people that have come through!  That's bigger than some of the towns I've lived in.  So, I'm officially dubbing this place "Minnow Town" and as it's original founder I don't think folks will mind if say I'm Mayor!

It's a massive team effort between the witnesses that run it @ausbitbank, @teamsteem, @someguy123, @thecryptodrive, @theprophet0, @canadian-coconut (honorary title),  the witnesses that visit @neoxian and @acidyo, the delegaters that have helped grow a @minnowsupport community account (shout out to @benjojo (90k SP) and @neoxian (20K SP), and about 1,000 minnows who are constantly in there talking, chatting, posting, upvoting, resteeming, following and making friends.

The chat is now ongoing 24/7.  There's almost always a Witness in there, Steemit's biggest author hang's out in there.  We have minnows, dolphins, and whales (Oh my!).  Whale curators search through some of those posts looking for gems.  I toss out bounties and resteems to exceptionally written articles.  The result has been staggering.  Folks that could barely catch a dollar before are now able to earn hundreds of dollars on a post, and it's as community of people supporting each other that has made that happen!

This has been an exceptionally rewarding experience as I think of this as my Witness Dissertation Project.  As a Witness I promise to promote Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, growth hack Steemit, and help minnows grow.  To see this social channel break 1,000 people so quickly has been amazing!  We're kickin' ass guys and it's showing in your account size!

We continue to fund drive for the main account.  So far in addition to the delegation we've been able to accumulate over 1,000 SP that now sits in that account paying out post rewards rewards to people that are in there.  The account is giving out approximately $220 in post rewards to users each day, the vast majority of whom are minnows,  through more than 1,400 user decided votes.

We have an outgoing message with all of those votes too.  You might see it, which explains what the Minnow Support Project is and how others can join us and why they should.  It's also a fund raising mechanism because people can upvote the comment and donate a little wealth to the @minnowsupport project account.  

We have dedicated groups to languages, countries, and even businesses now.  If you have a small community of people we can find them a home in a larger community, which helps all of us network, grow personally, and grow Steemit as a whole.

The bottom line is that this Discord Community is a lifeline and a wonderful community for Minnows and the atmosphere in there is helpful, kind, supportive, and energized.  I highly encourage you to stop writing the 5 hour posts that no one reads and don't offer rewards and instead learn about how to grow and get support from this wonderful community.  It can be a little overwhelming for new users, so just sit there for a few minutes, say hello, or ask the Greeters (who have their names in orange) for a little help on what to do.  You're wallet, your follower count, and your number of friends in the world will thank you for joining this initiative.  

If you're not in the PALnet Discord Channel then you're doing Steemit wrong.  Period.  https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw
