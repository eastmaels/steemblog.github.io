I'm often the melancholy sort.  I try to have a lot of energy and pour it into projects, but there's always a hint of sadness.  One of he main reasons why is the passing of my mom.  She died at the age of 59.  She was a pretty extraordinary woman.  She was fierce as could be, loved deeply, and tried to make the world a better place through her actions.  Hardly a day and certainly not a  week goes by without me missing her some way.  It makes Christmas extra hard.

## Am I the only one that doesn't love Christmas? <h2>

I just wish this thing was called what it is: an end of year sale.  I don't like how we're wrapping up a spirit of kindness and giving with buying stupid shit you don't need with money you can't really spare.  I can't sing but I was caroling.  I don't mind some aspects of this time of year... but I'll tell you a quick story.

I don't like the excessive gift giving, but that's not really taken into account in my home at Christmas time.  After an hour of opening presents my first baby says "Last year we had more presents."  Kinda broke my heart.  I try to instill an attitude of gratefulness and I think Christmas often times brings out massive selfishness.  So, we went sledding and I tried to have a Louis CK inspired discussion of gratefulness.

She got a little weepy, and so maybe I'm the worst Dad ever to make her sorta cry on Christmas, but I'm not gonna let this abject idiotic materialism ruin my kid's perspective on what good fortune actually means.  It's no fun holding the line, but I want a child with healthy perspectives and Christmas actually doesn't instill them.  Sorry not sorry.

To top that off I can't help but miss my mom.  It's been over 10 years since she passed.  I'm incredibly grateful for how fiercely she loved me, but it still stings because especially on the holidays I can feel that missing gap even to this day.  

So, I know this is a sorta Christmas Grump message, but as we approach the new year let us remember those we loved and lost, let us carry some of their best spirit with us, here's to those holding the line on sensibility during the Christmas season, and as we have some family time let's try to stay in that moment and store just a hint of it to carry with us later.

Much love,
Merry Christmas,

Aggroed
