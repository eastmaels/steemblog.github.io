<p>The Hard Times Series covers the life and times as government collapses and the life of those that live on.</p>
<p>"Prisoner 001776. &nbsp;I will not tell you again to get back to work." &nbsp;Officer Grip rode over to where the prisoner stood.</p>
<p>"Sir, sorry sir, but there's something in the field." &nbsp;Prisoner 001776's vision focused far to East. &nbsp;In the background he could see something large moving. &nbsp;It wasn't normal. &nbsp;It seemed to limp. &nbsp;Maybe it only had three legs.</p>
<p>Grip made sure he was close enough to 001776 to get a sense of where he was looking, but far enough to ensure that he couldn't try something stupid. &nbsp;Grip pulled out a pair of binoculars and looked in the direction that the prisoner indicated. &nbsp;Sure enough he could see the beast. &nbsp;It was larger than a dog, but smaller than an elephant. &nbsp;Maybe it was a bear. &nbsp;Grip had heard bears once roamed here before America had been colonized.</p>
<p>Grip turned to the prisoner "It's nothing son. &nbsp;Get back to work. &nbsp;Nothing is coming over here to interfere with this operation." &nbsp;Grip went back to the shade. &nbsp;He could feel his blood pulsing a little faster, but today wasn't the day the beast would challenge the field.</p>
