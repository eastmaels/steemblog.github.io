<p>My friends and I have spoken for years about a period of time known as The Hard Times. &nbsp;The Hard Times is a fantasy setting (for Americans anyway) where something happens in the world and everything changes immensely overnight. &nbsp;If that sounds vague it is and it's meant to be. &nbsp;I have a lot of friends that are preppers. &nbsp;If you watch the show preppers you'll realize people are doing things for a ton of different reasons. &nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is YOU ARE NOT PREPARED. &nbsp;The second point is that no one knows if and when the Hard Times hit and what causes them.</p>

<p>So, we talk about it haphazardly. &nbsp;It might be a comical discussion where we talk about the Hard Times version that's a zombie apocalypse. We talk about the Hard Times caused by upheaval in the Middle East and suddenly there isn't carbon fuels to rely on. &nbsp;We talk about the Hard Times as some kind of disease outbreak. &nbsp;There's lots of ways to create the Hard Times.</p>
<p>In most of these we imagine that cities are not safe places to be in the start at least, government is only partially helpful if at all functioning, and people are forced to rely on local communities to sustain most of what they need.</p>
<p>I was sick for a long time and had a form of writer's block that went along with it. &nbsp;I love writing fiction. &nbsp;So, I'm going to start a series called "The Hard Times" and put different characters in different scenarios. &nbsp;The world will change. &nbsp;The cause of the problems will change. &nbsp;The standard storyline will be some kind of survivor figured out how to make it past the initial happening. &nbsp;What's their world look like now?</p>
<p>The series is called "The Hard Times" and I'm making the keyword hardtimes. &nbsp;If you feel like writing in this environment feel free. &nbsp;It's a broad base and it could be fun to play off one another's characters.</p>
