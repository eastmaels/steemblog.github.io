<p>Mark rolled on top of the grenade and waited for his insides to explode. &nbsp;At least his fellow soldiers would be saved. &nbsp;He tried to picture his wife one last time before he left the world. &nbsp;He held onto that image for a moment, and then the moment lingered, and the gun shots still rang out. &nbsp;The grenade didn't explode. &nbsp;He lifted up the grenade to see a small metal fragment blocking the pathway of where the pin used to be. &nbsp;He was alive, and still had a chance.</p>

<p>Mark took threw the grenade far in front of him, and at the same time brought his M-16 to firing height. &nbsp;He unloaded half a clip when one of the bullets caught the grenade and it exploded knocking back enemy soldiers. &nbsp;He dove over the 4 wheeler that was obstructing his way, and over his shoulder unleashed the last of his clip.</p>
<p>He looked around. &nbsp;Most of his fellow soldiers weren't going to make it and he could see so many of them bleeding and needing help. &nbsp;Near the end of the hallway he could see it. &nbsp;The doomsday device. &nbsp;Between him and the device stood 5 towering robots. &nbsp;His reflexes would work, his body would work, he couldn't fail. &nbsp;Everyone would need him. &nbsp;He stood up from behind the vehicle.</p>
<p>"Rick?"</p>
<p>"Yes mom?"</p>
<p>"We have to go now. &nbsp;It's another air raid siren."</p>
<p>Rick dropped his toys and grabbed his bug out bag. &nbsp;He headed for the door, but reached back to grab Mark. &nbsp;Leave no many behind, and Mark clearly needed the help.</p>
