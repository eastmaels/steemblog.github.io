I'm doing panel discussions weekly now.  This Saturday is Steem Visions.  We've been gathering up some hugely popular and talented Steem Artists.  We'll talk to them about their work, how they work, and what it's like being an artist on Steem.

## Cohosts! <h2>

I count my blessings in the form of some amazingly talented cohosts!  @stellabelle, the lady behind Slothicorn is going to be helping to bring these artists to life and ask them questions about their experience, process, vision, and message.

I'm also joined by Minnow Support Project Sr. Moderator, JuJu Gum Conspiracy co-creator, and all around art talent @juliakponsford!

## Logistics <h2>

Show starts this Saturday, March 3rd at 11am EST (1600 UTC).
This is a highly visual experience and you're encourged to join the screen share and audio at https://mspwaves.com/listen.

We'll be live chatting in the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Discord Channel](minowpond.org).  We're just shy of 15,000 Steemians now in the server.  You'll be in good company.

If you're going to be on the show please get there early.  I start DJing around 10:30am EST.  That gives you time to audio check.  You'll want a working mic, speakers, and have some work ready to display through links or files.
