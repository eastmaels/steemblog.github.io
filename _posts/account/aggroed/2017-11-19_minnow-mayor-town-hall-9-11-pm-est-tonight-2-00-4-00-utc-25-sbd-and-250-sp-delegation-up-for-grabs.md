Looking forward to the Minnow Mayor Town Hall following the Steem Growth Forum.  We doubled the most people that we've had listening and participating with the radio station yesterday.  So, looking forward to keep building our audience and growing the MSP Waves.

You can listen within Discord: https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy
or at the station: mspwaves.com/listen

## It's a Town Hall Format <h2>

You are welcome to come on air and ask questions, promote something, introduce yourself, and you're welcome to bring concerns.  As per usual you're welcome to talk about difficult stuff or push me or stuff about the MSP, but two requests: 1 try not to go on offence. 2. Don't fight someone else's battles on air for them.  So, anyone that wants to come on air is welcome, I can give you five minutes or so.  Should be fun.  Talk about what you're interested in.

## You need a headset <h2>

In order to be on air you need a headset and a mic.  Before you come on air stop off in a waiting room and check your audio.

## 250 SP delegation <h2>

If you come on air you'll be eligible to win 250 SP.  I'll leave it on for at least 6 months or if you turn into a dolphin.  If you're already a dolphin or whale you can still win, but then you get to dictate who wins on your behalf.

## Dice Bitches <h2>

You can win 25 SBD on air.  You use a Discord bot to roll dice.  We start at t!dice 15d15 and will keep lowering the number.  If you tie or beat me you get to move onto the next round.  If you don't tie or beat me please don't keep rolling.  If I win once we'll start over.  If I win twice I'll send @msp-waves the 25 sbd.
