<p>I have this creepy feeling that I've seen a wealth distribution like STEEM seems to have before. &nbsp;It wasn't a beautiful community picture then either. &nbsp;It kinda looked like almost all of the wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few people that dictated how everything works while everyone else seemed eat the scrap off their tables. &nbsp;I'm talking mostly about the current state of income inequality in America, but it also kinda strikes me as the same balance as around here on STEEM.<img src="https://s9.postimg.org/lsyb69q4v/us_income_distribution.png" width="639" height="446"/></p>
<p>Now, before you guys downvote the shit out of me for this let me add I like STEEM. &nbsp;And I also don't want a lot of people telling me to go back to Facebook and enjoy the constant censorship there either. &nbsp;That place is kinda a shithole where it's nearly impossible to have an opinion counter to the mainstream and get any kind of voice. &nbsp;When you do get a voice it doesn't take long to see how quickly they move to silence you. &nbsp;So, from that stand point this place is better because at least I know my content gets out there.</p>

<p>But I wish I didn't have to choose. &nbsp;I also wish I didn't have to pray to the whale gods here that someone with some fucking steem power will upvote my weird ass content. &nbsp;What, apparently Dan never hangs around talking about the Mandela Effect all day? &nbsp;I guess I won't get STEEM then... Oh, maybe I should do a secret story about how I spend a lot of time writing content on STEEM that can't crack 30 votes. &nbsp;That should be good too.</p>
<p>So, I like this site. &nbsp;I like a lot of what goes on here. &nbsp;It's frankly better than just about ever other hole in the web I've seen before. &nbsp;That said, if I could wave my magic wand and change one thing this place wouldn't be so whale heavy (replace whale with billionaire and see how that feels) and if I get a second wish it's that I don't get flagged down until I have no choice but to troll facebook endlessly.</p>
<p>Fingers Crossed.</p>
