One of the best things I think you can do on Steemit to capture and keep an audience is to make a series out of the posts that you like doing the most.  Rather than having it be a one off you can keep using the same format over and over again.  Not only does it create a consistent experience for your audience, but it can help you lower the time investment necessary for each post that you do.

## Lessons from the Daily Show <h2>
I've sited the Daily Show as one of my inspirations for this comment a couple of times.  Every show followed an almost identical format.

Opening
Solo bit by host
bit 1
bit 2
Interview
Daily dose of zen
close credits

Every show!  Every Show for like 10 years!!!

## Meme the News is my current example of this <h2>

1. The image stays constant
2. The opening stays constant
3. You have a drawer full of brand new memes
4. Ending stay constant

## Speedup trick <h2>
Lemme walk you into my studio here!

I have a word doc that I keep open.  It has the image link, opening lines, and all the badges that I use already in there and formatted.  So, 1,2, and 4 literally take me all of copy/paste to get in there.

The rest of it is scrolling through facebook for an hour to mine for meme gems, but I've been doing that kind of scrolling since 2012 anyway.  This is just fun and a chance to share some funny shit with my audience.

## So, there you go! <h2>
You want some advice on how to grow and save time?  Serialize your posts, make a word doc for all the key things you plan on copying so you can just copy/paste them over.  Watch your time go down, enjoyment go up, and give your followers a base of things to expect from you!

You can find me lurking on steemspeak, a discord channel that many steemers use to text and talk to each other- https://discord.gg/qjpRj7w
I can also be found on steemchat as @aggroed.  If you have a post to share give me a good sentence or two of why you think Iâ€™ll like it.
