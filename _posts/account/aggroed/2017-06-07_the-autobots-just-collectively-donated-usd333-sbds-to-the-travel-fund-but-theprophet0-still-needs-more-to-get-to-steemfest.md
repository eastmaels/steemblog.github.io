Ok, I'm determined to send this kid to STEEMFEST.  His handle is @theprophet0.  He's 15, he's a writer for steemsports.  He's a funny and smart kid.  I've been helping to mentor him on this witness campaign stuff to my own detriment.  I had passed him in the ranking and so we talked about how to go about asking for votes, building a platform, and some of that stuff I learned from my state campaign where I won 6,000 votes (I still lost, but it was a good run).  So, kid turns around and uses my advice and gets @dan to boost him up with a massive vote and he turns around let's me know.  I can only imagine the shit eating grin on his face when he was telling me he just smoked me with a big upvote from the founder!  

He's got this hint of competitiveness that I really appreciate and I'm fully in support of this kid.  What's not to like?  The other witnesses have some doubts about his age because his voice is so deep, but excluding that he's a great kid and he's a wonderful story for the platform.  15, witness, writer, making it on the platform.  Honestly, it lifts my spirit and I'm determined to help my Steemit friend and fellow Witness.

## So, how'd we do? <h2>

I put out this post- 
https://steemit.com/steemfest/@aggroed/200-sbd-post-rewards-steemfest-travel-fund-giveaway-inspired-by-ausbitbank

I Promised $200 SBDs to the travel fund after getting inspired by @ausbitbank and his 1,000 steem donation.

The post earned another 133.  That's 333 SBDs at today's price of $2.11 (eff u dollar peg, market wins) we'll round that to $700!!!  BOOM!  We're awesome.

Kid just raised $361 on his own here- https://steemit.com/steemfest2/@theprophet0/your-youngest-witness-is-crowdfunding-a-ticket-to-steemfest2

That's amazing!  We're doing awesome, but I have bad news.  The flight costs $1600 so we're still $600 short.

## Time to run one more post <h2>

So, we have to get this kid there.  I'll match and/or exceed the post rewards from this post to make sure we hit the total of $600.  Here's hoping I don't have to do the whole thing myself, but if that's what it takes to get him there, so be it... Here's my pledge @theprophet0.  I'm getting you tickets to Steemfest come hell or high water. 

Last rewards we raised will go the travel fund, @t-r-f,  with a note that they should be ear marked for you.  All liquid rewards and missing amount to get you the ticket will be sent directly to @theprophet0.  If we exceed his need I'll start another post to start sending some minnows to steemfest that want to go.

Bud, I have good news.  The peeps following this blog are a pretty amazing and generous crowd.  We'll get you there together!

## Autobots Roll Out and help @theprophet0 get to STEEMFEST! <h2>
