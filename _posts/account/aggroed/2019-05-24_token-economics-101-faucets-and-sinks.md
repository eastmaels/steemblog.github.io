I'm probably going to have to repeat this 8 millions times as a founder of Steem-Engine.  So, here's a quick post that I'll likely refer to.  When discussing currencies there's a few things to consider: People, Faucets, and Sinks!

Overall, you have to gather people to **USE** the currency.  The currency will only have as much value as what you can do with it, and better yet what you can do with it that you can't do anywhere else!  If all you're doing is handing out tokens and there's no way to spend them then welcome to infinite inflation and a valueless system.  Simply sending tokens and holding them is hardly worth anything.  The real question is what can you **DO** with it.  An even better question is "what can I do with it that will take it out of supply or reduce incoming inflation?"  

The best question would be "what can I use this token for that I can't do anywhere else that's a highly desirable or required thing that all the users will do that also takes it out of circulation?"

What you can do with it gives it value.

What you can do with it that removes it from circulation puts upward pressure on the value.

## Let's start with some easy to use terms

In terms meant to be able to be understood by the broader public currencies have faucets and sinks.  A faucet is where the currency comes out of.  A sink is what the currency goes into never to return.

If the faucet runs forever and there is no sink your kitchen overflows.  You have hyperinflation, a pissed spouse, and your token is worthless.  Getting people to use the token is great.  It's even better if there are ways to **remove it from circulation**.  That puts an upward pressure on the price of your token while the faucet puts a downward price pressure on your token.


## Token Economics 101

You can create a token and give it out to people.  That's actually not that hard or that expensive to do.  The bad news though with how easy it is to distribute stuff using crypto is that it's not a high value thing.  Crypto is an accounting tool that makes this shit easy.  So, you can get small rewards for that, but it's not the center piece.  

**Aggroed's Law - 90% of the value of a token is in the use cases and SINK**

What's the difference between a use case and a sink?  A use case is a product or service that I can trade for using the token.  A sink is something that removes it from circulation entirely.

Getting listed on an exchange is an example of a usecase.  Now it has value because I can trade it for other things of value.  Being playable in a game is another use case.  You bought the non-fungible token so that you could play in the game.  You use the token to gamble, see nudes, chat with celebrities or whatever else you can think of.  The tokens aren't out of existence because I traded them, but the fact that I can trade them for something gives them value.

Setting up a tool that burns tokens (or the weaker cousin of offseting inflation) is an example of a SINK.  You could imagine burn bots instead of bid bots.  Send tokens to the burnbot, get a vote for Steem, and burn the tokens.  Now there's less token supply so the value of all tokens goes up from that event.

# Actual Currency Valuation

The value of a currency is equal to the the amount of goods and services that can be purchased or traded with that currency divided by the number of tokens in circulation.

Value of Goods and Services / Currency Supply = Token Value.

In order to make your currency more valuable you need a higher value of goods and services you can trade it for or a lower value of currency supply.

So, your difficult job of balancing things is to figure out a faucet that encourages people to get your token.  Find use cases and sinks for the token so that it has value to it.  Find ways to remove tokens from circulation over time.  And if you do all that correctly you can see your Token Value go up.
