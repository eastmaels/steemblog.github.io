We're doing shows tonight.  It's a combo of Shane, Isaria, and me, Aggroe (currently witness 6 on the Steem Blockchain).  I'm looking forward to see you lovely people in the audience.

We're upvoting minnow posts and talking about Peace, Abundance, and Liberty and especially about learning how to be peaceful with our neighbors.

Come visit us- minnowpond.org . we'll be in the #msp-audience
