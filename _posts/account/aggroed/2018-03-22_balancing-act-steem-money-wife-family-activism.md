Balancing a family isn't easy.  I've been married since I was 23.  My wife was barely legal drinking age at the time.  We're from New England... this isn't normal up here.  I literally saw my wife from across the room and knew "that's the girl I'm going to marry."  I was done after that.

## Anyway, fast forward and we've had good times and bad times

We've had some good years, and some bad.  We both did a bunch of school and earned grad degrees.  It's good times.  We've had some heart ache through deaths, arguments, and I've burdened my spouse with a bunch of EtOH challenges.

## Risk

Over the years I've stayed extremely risk confidant.  I'm still under 40, have a PhD, my skills are in demand, and I'm really good at what I do.  I'm never worried about having a job.  I'm really never all that worried about money, even in the lean times.  So, as part of this I put all our money into crypto.  It's gone down some, but I'm not nervous.  I'm actually more confidant than I was when I put it in.  Shit's gonna go up, and big up.  

That said, there's more than one person in this marriage and in this family.  So, I'm faced with two choices.  Pull some back out when the crypto is down or go work for a bit.  I don't actually think that I have to do either of these.  I can wait, but again, I'm not the only person trying to make this family work.

I don't want to get rid of my steem.  If anything I'm looking to grow my account.  I've been powering down, but that's not to have some massive cash out.  It's to make sure that I can have liquid steem when the mega rush happens (which I think is about 3-4 weeks from now).  When that happens I think a few things will happen.  Steem will spike, Steem will crash, and Steem will recover all within 1-2 weeks.  I want to be there with liquid steem when that happens.  If it goes according to plan I'll temporarily stash into tether, buy back in at a low, and then possibly cash out a little for comfort money, but still have more than when I started.  That's the game plan.

## Next step

I think I'm going to do some higher ed sales work again.  I'm rather enjoying not having full time employment, but I think the risk is adding undue stress to my marriage.  Changing this working is the most important thing for me to do, but it's based on a number of factors.  One of them being my wife's happiness and sanity.  So, I think I have to trade a little of my ultimate freedom and risk tolerance for a slightly more balanced work/life/steady income kinda thing.  I don't plan on that being my long term.  My long term is fullfilling the mission of the Minnow Support Project: Spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, help Steem grow, and train and retain minnows on the platform.

The world is broken.  It's run by criminal bankers who constantly cause harm.  It's not going to end with protest we need alternatives to government, government currencies, media, education, and many others.  I think what Steem is building is one of the most important changes in an entire system of governance in our lives.  To work on that and have freedom to operate I need a happy marriage, and that means a little more financial stability and a little more fiat/terrestial world for now.  I doubt it'll last forever, but I think starting in May when my non-compete runs out I'll take on some terrestial work and settle my family down a bit.

## what it entails

Actually the gig is super easy for me.  There are sales reps, they feed me demos, and I deliver them.  I'll have between 4-6 a day.  I won't have a commute.  I won't travel all that much as far as I can tell.  The company I'm gonna work for has 5 reps.  I'm betting each can score maybe 1-2 demos a day so that's an average of 6.  Many take an hour, but I bet I can push some of the lower revenue ones down to 30 min.

## Pal Studios

As part of this compromise instead of pushing to have an external Pal studios I'm pushing to have an internal one.  I'm going to take over part of my basement and setup shop there.  It cuts down on cost and makes it more convenient to film and get that going.  So, hopefully the media project I've been putting off while the price of BTC and steem are taking a hit can get going now that I don't have to worry about the long term financial costs of this.

## So, what changes now?

Nothing for now.  It's not even certain, but it looks like in May I'll have some demos to give while I'm Steeming throughout my day.
