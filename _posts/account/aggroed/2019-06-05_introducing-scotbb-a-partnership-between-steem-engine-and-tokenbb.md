## What is ScotBB?

**ScotBB allows you to create a forum and power it with your Scot and Scotbot.**

Scot is a Smart Contract Organization Token.  It's a word like coin or token, but it's specific to the Steem Engine platform.

Scotbot is a voting tool developed by @holger80 that uses logic similar to Steem to distribute Scot via Proof-of-Brain.

TokenBB is a steem powered forum developed by [BuildTeam](https://buildteam.io).

ScotBB uses the TokenBB tool developed by BuildTeam, and powers it with Scot and Scotbot.

## What's the benefit?

Incentivize discussions in your community with crypto.  Retain users.  Keep them engaged!

There's a really active forum that's part of League of Legends where people sit around all day and discuss the finer points of the game.  Imagine them doing that, but earning crypto the whole time.

## What's it cost?

There will be a 1000 ENG setup fee that will be automated through the Steem Engine site.  

Ongoing costs aren't announced just yet, but will be part of a larger pricing program to be launched "soon."

To be clear though.  Steem-Engine.com is moving away from charging ongoing costs in ENG and instead moving to a model where apps will need to stake ENG based on the amount of services and number of active users they have.

## Example: Monster Forum!

If you'd like an example of the look and feel of a forum go ahead and check out https://monsters.tokenbb.io/

You'll see that it's powered by Splintertalk (SPT) tokens.

## Example: PALnet Forums!

You can see a forum that's just starting to take shape for PALnet here: https://palnet.tokenbb.io/

Come introduceyourself!
