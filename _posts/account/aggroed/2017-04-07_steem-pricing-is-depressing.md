I mean that in two ways.  Way 1.  It's sad that it's that low.  Way 2. It's sad that it's going down more.

I keep saying this.  Things aren't going to change until this is addressed.  Whales with 90% of the steem in 1% of the people make what is otherwise an awesome system really unegalitarian system.  

The way this changes is that whales have to sell a lot of shit.  This will happen slowly over 5-10 years you'll see the ownership slowly spread into more hands at which point it will take off.  Or there will be a serious event that will bring the price crashing that will almost bankrupt the system, and may in fact bankrupt the system, before it would then be a more equitable position for everyone and then the price will take off.

So, for now.  Enjoy your $0.15 steem.  It's only going to go down for the next year.
