As per usual I'm hosting a Steem Witness Forum.  This is a chance to hear from Steemit, and then later to talk to witnesses about what they think is going on with regard to the platform and both the hurdles we face and ways we're rising to them.

If you'd like to join us for the discussion please listen at mspwaves.com or go to our Discord at minnowpond.org.

If you're a top 20 and would like to speak or a backup witness then please make sure that there's no way feedback from your speakers gets into your mic (headset works pretty well).

If you have questions you want me to ask Steemit (Eli) or the witnesses put them in the comments below or Discord chat and I'll try to get them.

Lastly, I'm travelling in Florida right now.  Hopefully there's no audio issues, but we'll see how she goes!
