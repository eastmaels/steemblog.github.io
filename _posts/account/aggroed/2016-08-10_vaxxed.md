<p>If you haven't watched Vaxxed you should.  It was a great watch and these 90 minutes are likely to save you and your family a boat load of trouble.</p>

<p>Here's the short of the story.  If you read the journal articles you have no choice but to believe that vaccines are absolutely crucial and beneficial to society.  If you read them critically as in a state of disbelief you have to come to the opposite conclusion.  It's tobacco science.</p>
<p><img src="//newshedgehog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/smoking-good-for-you.jpg" /><img src="//vapeaboutit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/smoking-is-good-for-you.jpg" /><br />

<p><br /></p>
<p>That's the story arc that #Vaxxed investigates.  See the CDC falsified the results of studies and manipulated them to remove evidence that vaccines induce autism especially in boys and even more especially in boys that are black.  They also go into detail about how the studies are funded by the drug companies that make $30B+ on each mandatory vaccine and the government officials that allow them and promote them end up getting sweet jobs in industry after their work is done.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Anyway, the video is available for <a href="http://vaxxedthemovie.com/stream/" rel="noopener">streaming </a>now.  It's a quick $4 that might save you thousands in medical bills and a life spent diligently nurturing an unhealthy child.</p>
