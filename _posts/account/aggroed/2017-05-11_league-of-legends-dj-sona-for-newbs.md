Look.  I can't always spam news.  Sometimes you have to talk about the things that don't matter.  in this case I'm gonna talk about my side chick:  DJ SONA.  She's a toon on league of Legends.  Nice lady.

A lot of times the healer in these games are chicks.  Not just the players, but an inordinate amount of women that I played wow with gravitated towards healer support role.  I'm typically a tank (thus aggroed), but in LOL I liked cait and enjoyed ADC for a bit.

So, I had a hard time getting into the support role.  It took me a while to realize that I don't like last hitting minions.  That's kinda lame.  What I like to do is hit opponents, do it successfully, and call them names like "you're fat and 12 and pwned your face"

So, as it turns out DJ Sona is a shit ton of fun.  Most of the times I'm farming gold by hitting my opponents.  Often times I'm dying in ganks cause she's squishy as shit, but that's ok because when it comes to team fights SONA is deadly.

Seriously, just ult the whole team and watch your APs smash face.

Anyway, that's enough off topic out of me.  I play LOL.  I'm currently silver.  I used to be gold but stopped playing for a while.  Names Aggroed there too.  HMU if you need a mediocre support that likes to talk shit.
