Minnow Support Project

>"Give a minnow an upvote and they'll eat for a day. Give a minnow a resteem and they'll eat forever."

Hello Minnows!
I recently hit 1,100 followers and broke into the top 110 authors on Steemit. It had a lot to do with @kaylinart and @fyrstikken resteeming one of my posts. 
it got me thinking...

What if I could help my followers like @kaylinart and @fyrstikken helped me!?! It's pretty easy to do. All I have to do is resteem my followers! What if I could get them a reward too!?!  And the Minnow Support Project was born!

## What are the rules? <h2>
For every 100 upvotes I'll resteem a follower's post
To be able to get a resteem simply link your post (or a referral if you want) in the comments section. Make sure there are at least 3 days left on the post rewards because I'm not going to resteem until Thursday.
The first resteem is the post that gets the most upvotes.
The second resteem is the post I think is best based on a criteria of promoting Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.
Third and up are based on upvotes as well.
Getting upvoted by bots doesn't count.
Winners will get all liquid post rewards from this contest!

## What counts as a minnow? <h2>
If you have less than 500 followers and have earned less than 5,000SP at the time you post then you're a minnow that's eligible for the resteem and the reward!  

## Who won last week’s contest?” <h2>

No word yet from last week's winner... Wait!!!  This just in, check the comments section!
