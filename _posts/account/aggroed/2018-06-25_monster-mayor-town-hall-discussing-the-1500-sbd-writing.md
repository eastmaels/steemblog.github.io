Steem Monsters recently launched a 1500 SBD writing contest to write the campaign setting to the game.  What is that?

Well, a campaign is the single player mode.  It's the story that you walk through in the game.  

Before we can build that story though we have to know the setting.  What's a setting?  Well think like a playwright.  Is the game set in the wild west?  Is it horses, cowboys, and indians?  In the game set in the future?  Is it giant insects and space ships?  Is the game fantasy with summoners and monsters?  

What characters live in the world?  How is their society organized?  What do people do there?  What does magic look like.

Before you can build stories that lots of people can contribute to we have to create the setting.  So, the document that people are encouraged to build is kinda like writing a guidebook chapter travelling through that "Splinter."  

If you're into the game and looking to write for us you'll want to stay tuned to how these turn out and what the background to each Splinter looks like.
