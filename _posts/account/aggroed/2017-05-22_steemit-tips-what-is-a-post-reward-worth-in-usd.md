So, I've been curious for a bit how the math of a post reward works out.  My central question- For every dollar that is shown in a post reward how much is it worth in USD right meow?

So, I'm going to use this post as my example.  It's a Meme the News Post from 1 week ago.

As you can see the post earned 8.25.

What actually got deposited in my account was-![rewards2.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmetjSxFMQMc3EC7jt3vB7exwjyr7YdvmYAAQcXRDgb4Yo/rewards2.jpg)

So, that's 3.134 SBD and 2.558 steem power (1 steem is 1 steem power).  

So, now let's go to Poloniex to see what those are worth.  We gotta start off by knowing how much USD a bitcoin is worth.
![Btc Poloniex.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSZTku5R4tdJAMWeNYoAn6TUof3JHGP6Fc8xktMNtmCvX/Btc%20Poloniex.jpg)

Looks like it's a whopping $2139 USD!!!

Next up have to figure out how many Steem make up 1 BTC.![steem poloniex.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYn1qWbzK77QwZGPtgUcntigngkAtCGhFXH3WyjTvvRX3/steem%20poloniex.jpg)

So, 1 steem is worth .00052385 btc.  So, 0.00052385 X $2139 is $1.12 USD/Steem! Since I earned 2.558 steem power then the total that came from that is $2.86.

OK, now for the SBD.![sbd poloniex.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSVYgM37k8rWywmC4KScBqQYqrt6cGMLdQ9MuLHfHXYoh/sbd%20poloniex.jpg)

Looks like each SBD is worth 0.00087854 btc.  So, that means 1 steem is worth $1.88 USD.  Since I earned 3.134 SBD then the total amount earned from SBD was $5.89 USD.

That brings my total to $5.89 +2.86=  $8.75 USD!

That's 6% higher than what the post reward shows (since it's in steem currency).  

## Rule of thumb <h2>
If you need a quick method to figure out how much a post is worth in USD simply multiply the value shown as the post rewards by 1.06 and that's how much it's currently worth in USD.  These numbers change frequently, but for now that's a pretty good measure.
