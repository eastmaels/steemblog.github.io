Well, I was really excited about the pump I just announced.  I was stoked because I had 400 SBD sitting around and converted it to steem on the internal market.  I didn't quite catch the $3+ sbds today, but I caught the ones over $2.

I thought I was pretty pimp for turning $400 into $800 in just a few minutes, but that's nothing compared to our financial monster @smooth.

Smooth was able to cash in on the pump with at least 60k SBD.  At 2X that's $120k USD.  Looks like he got some more steem with it!

I haven't gone through the other accounts yet, that's a better fit for @paulag, but I just want to say congrats to @smooth for his big trading day.  I wasn't dreaming about being a day trader before.  Color me interested.

## Enjoy your new house! <h2>
