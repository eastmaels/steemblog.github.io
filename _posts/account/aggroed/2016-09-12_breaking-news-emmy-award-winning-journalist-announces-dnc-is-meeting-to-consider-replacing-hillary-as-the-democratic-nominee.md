<p>Within just a few hours the DNC is meeting to consider replacing Hillary as the democratic nominee.</p>
<p>What is known is that at the very least the Clinton team has released a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/hillary-clinton-collapse-democratic-candidate-diagnosed-with-pneumonia-after-stumbling-at-911-event-a7237551.html">diagnosis of pneumonia</a> and that may only be the <a href="https://steemit.com/politics/@aggroed/breaking-news-clinton-collapses-at-9-11-service-alleged-personal-neurologist-dr-okunola-is-there-on-site">tip of the iceberg</a>.</p>
<p>Especially because of the lack of transparency and often dishonest nature of the Clinton campaign some members of the public remain skeptical. &nbsp;Especially as pneumonia is a contagious illness why would she risk hanging around with children?</p>
<p><img src="https://s18.postimg.org/xmjs05ad5/clinton_pn.jpg" width="397" height="391"/></p>
<p>Anyway, this DNC meeting isn't a grand conspiracy theory. &nbsp;It was leaked by Emmy Award winning journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidShuster/status/775093724363784192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">David Schuster</a>.</p>

<p>Article 2 section 1&nbsp;of the DNC bylaws state-</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>The Democratic National Committee shall have general responsibility for the affairs of the Democratic Party between National Conventions, subject to the provisions of the Charter and to the resolutions or other official actions of the National Convention. This responsibility shall include, but not be limited to â€¦ Filling vacancies in the nominations for the office of the President and Vice President.</em></p>
<p>So, if you on the off chance you thought that the democratic primary couldn't get any less Democratic after the constant <a href="https://electionfraud2016.wordpress.com/">vote irregularities (rigging)</a>, and <a href="http://usapoliticsnow.com/breaking-apparently-bernie-wins-roll-call-nomination-dnc-called/">the fact that in the first actual vote for nominee Clinton delegates didn't show up, Bernie won, and a recount was forced in the afternoon </a>we're about to get worse. &nbsp;The DNC leadership, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/">a crooked, lying, rigging, and racist group</a> of people are now going to choose the next nominee for the dems. &nbsp;Party leadership not party participation will have the ultimate say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In case you hadn't noticed. &nbsp;Your <del>democracy</del> constitutional republic is broken and the founding/current documents either allowed this to happen or were powerless to stop it.</p>
