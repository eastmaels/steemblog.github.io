Hey all.  I've gotten a lot of positive feedback from the Witness forum today.  We had a minor technical issue so it's broken up into two parts.  It kicked off with @andrarchy giving us some lowdown on Steemit.  We heard some of what they are working on and some of the methodology of how they figure out what's important.  That goes on for about 30 minutes or so into the first video.

The rest of the videos are comprised of witness conversation.  Some of it is introductory, some is trying to talk about hte biggest problems on the network.  The last piece is really about figuring out what the key stake holder groups need to be successful (devs, investors, bloggers, and merchants).

The crew in attendance were @andrarchy from Steemit then the witnesses were @roelandp, @aggroed, @lukstokes, @jerrybanfield, @followbtcnews, @pharesim, and the backup witness was @yabapmatt.  It's a good dicussion and hopefully you enjoy listening to it.  There were roughly 75 Steemians in attendance at the height of the broadcast and roughly 100 Steemians that joined at one point or another for the livestream.
