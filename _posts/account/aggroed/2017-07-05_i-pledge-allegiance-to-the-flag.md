Let's break down the pledge so that people see where Americans are taught to Americate from the tender age of 6 through the beginning of their adult lives may not actually be in the interest of peace, abundance, and liberty.  I like to do these things the before or after so folks aren't maximum triggered.


## I pledge allegiance to the flag <h2>

>See, when you start doing this at the age of six roughly 250 times a year for the next 12 or so years it looks less like a sweet gesture and more like you're indocturnating children into a ritualistic pattern of obedience towards actions of the state.
>I have reason to believe "The Flag" is actually a trade name for the USG, INC.  It's not as simple as pledging to a colored piece of cloth.  It actually means the corporation that runs this place.

## of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA <h2>

>This again isn't actually the dejure government that you think it is.  The act of 1871 created an illegal district in the actual Republic and it's one of the starting points of the Government Services Corporation pretending to be the actual government.

## and to the Republic for which it stands <h2>

>So, here it's actually recognizing that the flag and the Republic aren't actually the same thing.  It's simply representing it.  The actual living government crafted through the Articles of Confederation  and up through the original Constitution containing the actual 13th amendment that was ratified still exists... but it's been abandoned for years.  And these corporate assholes just point to it and say, well we're not them, but we represent them.

## One nation, under God <h2>

>Creepy fact.  The USG, INC is actually a religious non-profit registered I believe in Delaware.  I'm sure nation has it's own special meaning that I've been meaning to look up in Black's Law Dictionary.  It's not what you think.

## With Liberty and Justice for All <h2>

>Ummm... we seem to have different definitions of Liberty.  Having to present papers and get my testicals groped by blue gloved TSA agents is a profoundly different definition.  As for justice... it's corporate law.  It's admirality law.  It's maritime law.  It's strawman law.  How can you have actual justice when the court judges are administrators abusing their position and falsely representing their law through a series of uncontested presumptions.

There's basically a 150 year falsehood that's perpetuated in school's all across this country, but the truth is the actual government had to stop functioning during the civil war because there wasn't a quarum anymore.  So, Abe et. al created a government services corporation claiming to represent the real thing with a copy cat constitution to keep it going.  We haven't had a true functioning government since then, but the good news is that these people are crooks and phonies and if we work together we can change this system by exposing what they've done.

Don't construe me as Anti-American.  I agree with Mark Twain.
