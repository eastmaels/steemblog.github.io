# <center> The Peace Academy // Curriculum // Personal Boundaries // Part 2 </center>

<center> ![](https://i.imgur.com/5nze8jm.jpg) </center>

<center> Personal Boundaries are the rules we set for ourselves regarding our relationships with others.  You can read Part 1 of this series [Here](https://steemit.com/peaceacademy/@aggroed/the-peace-academy-curriculum-on-personal-boundaries-part-1)
*Healthy Boundaries* occur between the two extremes of *Rigid Boundaries* and *Porous Boundaries*.
</center>

---


## Examples of Rigid Boundaries:

* Emotionally detached, even in romantic relationships
* Avoids asking for help
* Doesn't open up with others
* Has very few close relationships
* Avoids close relationships and intimacy
* Lives in isolation
* Refuses to process the needs and concerns of others
* Pushes others away to avoid the possibility of rejection


---


## Examples of Porous Boundaries:

* Allows others to be disrespectful or abusive
* Difficulty saying “No”
* Shares too much personal information
* Overly involved with other people's problems
* Doesn’t stand their ground
* Always compromises to make others happy at the expense of their own happiness
* Emotionally raw at inappropriate times
* Values other people's opinions over their own
* Complies with others out of fear of rejection


---

## Examples of Healthy Boundaries:

* Communicates wants and needs in a clear and healthy manner
* Can say “No” when necessary and accepts “No” from others
* Does not over or under share personal information
* Stays true to values and doesn’t compromise them for others
* Values their own opinions

## MSP was using these guidelines as we wrote our community rules! <h2>

If you check this post- https://steemit.com/minnowsupportproject/@minnowsupport/minnow-support-project-community-rules

You can see that the Minnow Support Project has some community rules.  There are two that we put in that are specifically addressing boundaries of the folks that are in the PALnet Discord group:

> The Minnow Support Project can be an emotionally intense place at times. You are welcome to talk about your problems, challenges, and issues that you are dealing with. People get raw, and people get extremely guarded. If you are raw or extremely guarded you are allowed to be in MSP asking for help or looking for support, but don't come in at that time expecting to work in any official capacity.

as well as 

> Each person is expected to maintain a level of social maturity that will prevent escalation of arguments and debate from turning into harmful actions. You are expected to know how to properly relate to acquaintances, family, neighbors, friends, and intimate relationships. This includes, but is not limited to:

>Ability to accept constructive criticism
>Ability to hear complaints and criticism without immediately acting out
>Ability to empathize with other community members

These two rules are specifically designed to help people maintain appropriate boundaries that are necessary for good community relations.
