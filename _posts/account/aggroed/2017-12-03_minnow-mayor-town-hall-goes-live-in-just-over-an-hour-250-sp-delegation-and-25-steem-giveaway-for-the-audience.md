And a fine evening to all the Steemians out there.  Once again we'll be having our Minnow Mayor Town Hall live on mspwaves radio.  The format is the same.  It's a call in show where you are welcome to join in the voice conversation.  I'm giving everyone that wants to come on at least 5 minutes and sometimes longer.  You can promote yourself, a group, a cause, a coin, a plan, a whatever.  You're welcome to ask hard questions and talk about things you don't like.

When coming in hard at me I have two things I'd like you to do.  One try not to use personal insults.  You can express frustation all day about ideas and actions, but let's try to not make it personal or against Steemit Inc itself.  Secondly, depending on what you say you might hear me ask "You're currently complaining, please elevate your complaint to a request."  A complaint is something like "I don't like X."  A request is "I don't like X, and I wish you/we/steemit would do Y instead."  Please try to offer a solution at the time that you are posing a complaint is what I'm saying here.

## Delegation <h2>

There's a 250 Sp delegation up for grabs.  Anyone that comes on air is eligible.  I'll keep it on you or your proxy for a minimum of 6 months.  I'm not dying to micromanage these and it takes time for Minnows to grow out of the need for one.  If you're a dolphin or whale and you come on the show you're welcome to be eligible, but you have to specify a minnow account that should receive the delegation.  If none is offered I'll add the total to @msp-waves.

## Dice Bitches <h2>

We'll play dice.  25 steem is up for grabs tonight.

`t!dice 15d15`
if you tie or beat my roll you can roll in the next
`t!dice 14d14` and so on.
Last one standing wins.
If I win once we start from scratch.  If I win twice we I'll send the steem to @msp-waves.

## Logistic <h2>
