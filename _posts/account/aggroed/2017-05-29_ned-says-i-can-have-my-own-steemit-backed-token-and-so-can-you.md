So, @fyrstikken organized a fireside chat with @ned, and he held it in the Steemspeak channel in Discord.

![](https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/237364424103428108/276870347024891906/U5dtvvRHq4hx1SsPwXP2ugzEgKimbgP.png)

If you haven't joined this channel at all yet your nuts.  It's filled with great thoughts by really smart crypto folks.  Investors, inventors, designers, programmers, Steemit employees, and even Steemit CEO's hang out in there.  The closest way to get public access to insider like info is to hang out in there.

## Tokens <h2>
In this last conversation @ned as talking about Steemit as a platform for issuing new tokens.  While in other systems these simply represent assets in Steemit they would duplicate the whole community atmosphere.  You can upvote in Aggroed Tokens.  You get rewards in them.  You can set reward pools, and basically any feature of the blockchain that can be controlled can be uniquely programmed for your one token.  So, you could see specific communities like housing complexes, businesses like real estate groups, or a whole new crop of something totally different.  But instead of being pure shitcoins without a user base it's all powered by the steemit blockchain.

## Comment Widgets <h2>
Imagine you're on your favorite news blog, zerohedge.com, and you leave a comment.  Instead of being in a generic comment section you now have to sign in to your steemit account and start leaving posts that can earn upvotes and rewards.  It's like the post was the zerohedge article, but the comments section converts to a steemit one.  So, you could get rewards for commenting on your favorite articles and stories.  How cool is that?

## Here's the full experience <h2>

Next time I hope you'll get it direct by joining us in Steemspeak.  I'm often lurking in there from 6-12 pm EST as Aggroed.
