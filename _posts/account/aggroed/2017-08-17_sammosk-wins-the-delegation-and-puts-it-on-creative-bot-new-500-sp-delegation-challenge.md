@sammosk is killing it in the polls!  He takes on another delegation win with 30 votes out of 83 votes cast for a total of 36% of all votes!  But true to form as a MSP mod he messaged me and said if he wins he doesn't want the delegation himself he wants it to go to msp-creativebot so that all the minnows can benefit from it and not just him!  So, with love in my heart for Sammosk and his decision I'm putting another delegated 500 SP on @msp-creativebot.

## New Delegation Challenge <h2>

You have to tell me a story of an interaction you've had with another member in PALnet.  You and the person you tell the story about will both receive 250 SP (try to stick with just two people, but I'll just keep dividing).  I support the moderators in running the place, so I'm looking for a heart warming story here.  How did someone make a difference in your life?  How did someone help you?  How did someone show the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty?  

To be clear the story can be about any two people PAlnet.  The award will go to a minnow though, so if the person you tell a story about is a already a dolphin they will get to choose who receives the delegated SP.

Write that up in a story in the comments.  I'll take the few highest voted (reviewing both most votes and highest value vote), and pick a winner from the top 3.  Max story length is 55 words, which foreshadows the next contest.

## Best of luck guys <h2>

Pull some heartstrings!
