<p>Anthony Weiner has become synonymous with dick pics of late. &nbsp;He's twice now been busted sending the photos to extramaritial parties, but this time it's gone too far. &nbsp;He's recently been outed for sexting with a 15 year old girl. &nbsp;The sensation has led to to impending divorce with his wife Huma Abedin, who is a Clinton Aide, and suspected radical Muslim due to ties with family members acting on the board of radical newspapers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.sagacom.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F3%2Ffiles%2F2013%2F07%2Fanthony-weiner.jpg&amp;f=1" width="1240" height="800"/></p>
<p>Huma stuck around for the first dick picing scandal but has decided to leave now that the second one involves children indicating her ability to still accept mother of the year. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Anthony however hasn't quite given up on his marriage or his political career.</p>
<p>"I would like the country to know that despite this looking like a sexting scandal I'm actually just trying to interact with voters in my precinct and let them know about what happened to Harambe was an absolute tragedy." &nbsp;He says in reference to the absolutely amazing gorilla that was viciously murdered at the Cincinnati Zoo earlier this year.</p>

<p>Some people accept that message right away, but other really need more to accept the WHOLE message. &nbsp;Media is corrupt, violence abounds, and the news cycle covers gorillas and not the flagarent human rights violations. &nbsp;Dicks out is the best way to respond to all of that." &nbsp;Says the disgraced former Congressman.</p>

<p>The text chain included "DO4H" and threats of violence.</p>

<p>While nothing excuses sexting a child in his general defense Weiner was seen campaigning in this costume suggesting the possibility he was simply campaigning for social justice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;That said Huma wasn't buying it, which contributed to the divorce path.</p>

<p>When writing this article we had tears in our eyes when even Siri understood the struggle.&nbsp;</p>
