I don't know who on the platform still has some SBDs handy, but this is pretty wild to watch.  Prices are spiking.  I think @acidyo called it when he published how a Korean exchange is now listing Steem and people can buy it straight from fiat.  It's pumping the price of sbds and it's raised the price of steem seemingly by 60 cents preactically overnight.

## What's @clayop have to do with this? <h2>

Community building is important.  Steem is only as strong as the number of people engaged in this place, and that means growing communities.  @clayop is basically a 1 man army helping to grow the Korean community.  He's a curator, a leader, and a top witness helping to promote us in Korea.  We wouldn't be having this success without him and his work, so thanks @clayop.

## Community Building is one of the best things you can do for Steem <h2>

We have a variety of tools that can help that we've developed at the Minnow Support Project.

MSP3k-  Communities isn't here yet, but the closest thing to community curation on the block right now is msp3k.  If you have a team of curators looking to share a single account we can help with a free tool that lets you share an account without having to share the keys.  Upvote, post, and resteem all from 1 place!  @netuoso won the first MSP Medal of Honor for it's creation!!!

Vote Delegation Helper:  Man, I hate the name.  I like the name msp-toolbox, but whatever.  This program created by @followbtcnews and @crimsonclad (the witness is @followbtcnews) allows people to delegate to a central account and receive automatic votes from it.  It's designed to help build a community account and incentivize people to delegate into that community account.  It's also a free tool that the Minnow Support Project leadership can help you setup.

## Happy mooning!  Much thanks to the financial investment of the Korean community <h2>
