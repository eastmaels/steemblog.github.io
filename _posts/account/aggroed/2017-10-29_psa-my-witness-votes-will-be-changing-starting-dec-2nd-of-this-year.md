Please check out this post: https://steemit.com/minnowsupportproject/@minnowsupport/minnow-support-project-updated-witness-voting-a-public-service-announcement

It explains that as of right now @minnowsupport proxies to me and I vote however I want.  We're changing that so that I'm going to proxy to @minnowsupport and the witnesses and moderators in the Minnow Support Project will vote based on witness applications to determine who the project will vote for and provide support.

## Application process <h2>

Check out the post I mentioned it walks through basically providing a witness application to the Minnow Support Project and then we'll vote on it.  The three main questions are:

How do you support the Steemit ecosystem?
How do you support minnows on the platform?
How do you support the Minnow Support Project?

We will vote based on your answers to those questions. 

## Yeah, I'll be applying soon too <h2>

Anyone that wants the vote, and I'll include myself, has to talk about what they pledge and how they will help.  I'll be writing up a post about the delegations, radio shows, organizing, and what it takes to manage the  5000 active Steemian community of the Minnow Support Project.  So, no one that wants a vote is excused from having to apply.  I'm not looking for very specific things.  There are a million ways to help this place, but it is a competitive process and we will be looking to support the people that either provide the most utility to the community or seem like deserving minnows who should get a shot to see what they can do for the platform too.
