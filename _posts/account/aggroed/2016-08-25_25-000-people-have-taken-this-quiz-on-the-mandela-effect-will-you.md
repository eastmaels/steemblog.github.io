<p>Are &nbsp;you are winding down your Thursday afternoon? Here's a little fun thing to distract you from your day.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Mandela Effect!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The effect was coined by Fiona Broome. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/f47b934307.jpg" width="233" height="350"/></p>
<p>She's a paranormal researcher that started a <a href="http://mandelaeffect.com/">website </a>about "when someone has a clear memory of something that never happened in this reality. "</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Before we talk about this at all I want you to go ahead and take this <a href="http://goo.gl/EhPW8U">quiz</a>. &nbsp;It has a fair number of questions, but you're going to get a strong sense that what you remember and what is recorded history are two very different things. &nbsp;25,000 people have taken that quiz. &nbsp;Hopefully you'll find like many others it was worth it and worth sharing.</p>
<p>Please take the <a href="http://goo.gl/EhPW8U">quiz </a>before you continue reading.</p>

<p>It started with people having a clear and vivid memory of Nelson Mandela dying in prison. &nbsp;The weird thing is though that history has recorded that it never happened. &nbsp;People have memories of being in school and having announcements go off that he was dead. &nbsp;It's not just one or two people, as many as 15% of society has a recollection of him dying 20-30 years prior to his actual death.</p>
<p>There are other ones that have gained popular attention. &nbsp;"Mirror Mirror on the Wall" was never said in a Snow White. &nbsp;The King James version of the Lord's Prayer has one line in the lord's prayer as "forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors." &nbsp;There are 6 people in the car that JFK was assassinated in instead of 4 people that many folks remember (the governor of TX and his wife are in the car now).</p>
<p>The thing I am pretty sure of is that there is an actual effect. &nbsp;The 25,000 people that have taken this have clearly demonstrated to me that the world is not responding the way I think it's supposed to. &nbsp;Folks get the controls right at 95%+ levels (early versions of the questions didn't have a guess option so it's a little different than what the website currently shows). &nbsp;When it comes to the Mandela Effect questions people get the "right answer" between 15-80% of the time. &nbsp;So, people can distinguish between the subtle differences that are listed, but the majority recall something different than what history records.</p>
<p>What I'm not sure about is what does the effect mean. &nbsp;Fiona claims that it suggests that people shift through timelines. &nbsp;That's really hard to confirm. &nbsp;I personally have some distinct memories of the Berenstein Bears, but that name doesn't exist anywhere in history except for weird parts of the internet where people talk about this stuff. &nbsp;So, how come I have distinct memories of that, but it never existed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not the only one. &nbsp;Here's someone filling in an open response question from the quiz. &nbsp;</p>
<p>" I don't know what is happening, but there is def something happening. its not a conspiracy, because we are talking about peoples memories and private possessions and original productions of items being changed. its just physically impossible ( unless of course the conspiracy is some kind of matrix/mind control/virtual reality all together) for example i watch movies over and over again, i always have. in some cases even memorize the whole movie word for word. i own silence of the lambs, and watched it and others from the series obsessively for sometime. I know for a fact Anthony Hopkins says to Julieanne Moore "Hello Clarice" ...but he doesn't. And upon checking my original release DVD ... I could recite nearly the whole movie ... not everyline but most.* weird part* out of all the lines I did recite, the only incorrect line was " hello Clarice" it just just doesn't happen. This is no false memory because I used to know the movie back to front. watched it reciting the lines many times in my younger years. That is my favourite part of the whole movie, I know it was there .... but it is not. WTF IS GOING ON... Seek the truth no matter where it takes you... believe in what you know. "</p>
<p>What also shows up from the survey is that the takers don't agree either. &nbsp;Some think it's a memory problem, some think it's CERN doing crazy things, some think it's a government conspiracy, and some think it's merging timelines. &nbsp;It's also pretty impossible to prove anything too. &nbsp;In science you need control experiments, but as far as I know there isn't a duplicate copy of this reality to compare against (at least one I can access).</p>

<p>Take the quiz.</p>

<p>What do you think is going on?</p>
