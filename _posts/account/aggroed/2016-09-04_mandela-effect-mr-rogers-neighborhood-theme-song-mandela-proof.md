<p>Ok, in my universe he sang "It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood." &nbsp;He didn't sing "it's a beautiful day in this neighborhood." &nbsp;This implies it's just a nice day in his neighborhood. &nbsp;The whole idea is that in this kids show everyone has a beautiful neighborhood. &nbsp;Anyway. &nbsp;Don't agree with me?</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy does a skit lampooning Mr. Rogers Neighborhood called Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood. &nbsp;In that skit Eddie sings at the start "It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood."</p>
<p>Here are some examples</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/mr-robinsons-neighborhood/n9117">Babies</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/mister-robinsons-neighborhood/n9299">Christmas</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/mr-robinson/n9141">Nutrition</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/mister-robinsons-neighborhood/n9101">Summer</a></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now, why would Eddie Murphy sing the wrong song not once, but 4 times in 4 different skits over 2 years?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Glad I cracked the code on this one!</p>
