I've recently achieved witness position 27.  The privilege of this is I'm able to get 50 steem/day or so.  My plan is to delegate the steem to various people and projects in the Minnow Support Community.

This week I'm going to add 250 to a mod and 100 to a bot.

Here are the mod choices-

msp-waves is eligible too.

In the comments below please type in the names of up to two mods and two bots.

Any millennials in the contest that lose will be given a participation certificate to make sure they are emotionally validated.

I'll decide the winner within the next 48hrs or so.
