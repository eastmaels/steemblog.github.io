It's Sunday night on the east coast.  That means it's time for more radio show.

Hop into Minnowpond.org, which is the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel.

Scroll down the rooms and look for where folks are gathered and come hear some tunes in check in on happenings around Steem.

If you'd like to come on air you'd be welcome to, just bring a headset and come hang out with us.
