Years ago @eonwarped, the dev behind Nitrous, realized that how the promoted tab worked was kinda dumb.  If I want to promote a post I click promote, send SBD, and I get my post in a promoted tab.  The promoted tab is basically all advertisements for stuff.  That's cool and all, but most people don't go onto their tv to watch a channel for advertisements.  it's kinda silly.

## Post Promotion on Nitrous and www.palnet.io specifically

I promoted 3 different posts today.  I did 3 Palcoin, 2 Palcoin, and 1 Palcoin on three different posts.  The results are awesome.

You can see there are three posts that are interwoven into trending based on how much they were promoted for.  If you promote a post people will actually see it.  The palcoin spent is sent to @null.

## This makes sense

So, now trending which some people do actually look at has actually promoted posts not just ones that have been bidbotted.  Good times!
