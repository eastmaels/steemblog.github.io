<p>Thought I'd drop a little update on the folks who care about mining.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I started trying to use Nicehash for both mining and then sell hashing power service, but the miner crashed windows 10. &nbsp;So, now I have a few different setups using claymore's zec miner which is on version 9.1.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have my main PC which is running windows 10 on a fast i7 and has a Radeon 480 in it.</p>
<p>I have my wife's PC which is running windows 10 on a slow intel chip with limited ram. &nbsp;It has a Radeon 470 in it.</p>
<p>I have a mining rig that has 4 Radeon 470s and 1 Radeon 460 in it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each PC pulls between 70-90 watts just for being on.</p>
<p>The Radeon 480 pulls about 150 watts when it's mining.</p>
<p>The Radeon 470 pull about 120 watts when they are mining.</p>
<p>The Radeon 460 pulls about 70 or so watts when it is mining.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Radeon 480 is making 220 H/s. &nbsp;The Radeon 470 is making 200 H/S. &nbsp;The Radeon 460 is making 96 H/S.<br>
<br>
My total hashing power is about 1316/s. &nbsp;The total watts that are related to mining are 1010 (and about another 200 for CPUs that I would have kept on anyway).<br>
<br>
My electricity costs $0.2/KWh so I use about $4.60 of electricity for mining each day.</p>
<p>BTC to USD is $773 USD/ BTC</p>
<p>Mining through nice hash pay fluctuates between .006-.011 btc per day for 1k H/S. &nbsp;I think I'm averaging about $7/day right now in revenue. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So, overall it looks like I'm making $2.40/day doing this. &nbsp;Given that it cost me about $1600 for everything it doesn't look like I'm going to get paid back any time soon. &nbsp;The other thing to consider is that as my wife noted electricity is paid with after tax money. &nbsp;So, real electrical costs because of taxes are probably closer to $0.26/ KWH. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
If I can figure out a way to get electricity cheaply then this looks pretty worth it. &nbsp;$7 a day for 365 days is more than $2g a year, but it does seem like trying to do this with expensive ass electricity in New England doesn't quite work out.<br>
<br>
All that said, my heat is electric too. &nbsp;And all of this stuff gives off heat. &nbsp;So, to some extent I can discount my electric heating bill by how much I'm producing by mining. &nbsp;Here's an example of what that looks like.<br>
<br>
My ASIC miner which is an Antminer S7-LN uses 740 watts to make 2.7 TH/S. &nbsp;My space heater for my attic where I work and blog from requires 640 watts. &nbsp;The real space heater is a little better than my ASIC device, but they work roughly the same. &nbsp;So, if I assume that the ASIC is only using 100 watts to make 2.7 TH/S and the rest is going to heat then that's pretty good actually. &nbsp;I turn it off at night. &nbsp;I turn it on in the morning. &nbsp;My space is warm and some bitcoin get made.<br>
<br>
Time to invent a free energy device.<br>
