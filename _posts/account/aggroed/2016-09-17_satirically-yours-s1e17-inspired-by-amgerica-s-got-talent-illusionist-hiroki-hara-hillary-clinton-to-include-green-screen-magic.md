<p>After an <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@aggroed/breaking-news-wabc-7-appears-to-runs-a-story-about-hillary-clinton-s-death-and-then-promptly-removes-the-story">uneventful day</a> of rest after battling pneumonia Secretary Clinton found herself losing ground in the polls to her republican arch nemesis businessman Donald Trump. &nbsp;The Donald now leads by 6 points according to the LA Times poll of likely voters.</p>

<p>While her campaign pushed out a series of hard hitting tweets she decided to get rest in order to heal and prepare for the final 50 day campaign push. &nbsp;While settling into her bed for rest she decided to check her email on her private server.</p>

<p><strong>Dramatization</strong></p>
<p>However, while fully intentioned on sleeping she decided to briefly check her email on her private server and was surprised to find a few emails from her old friend former <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/colin-powell-emails-clinton-trump-rumsfeld-228158">Secretary of Defense Colin Powell</a>. &nbsp;Among a number of other fun memories Powell notes that he's begun watching America's Got Talent as he adjusts back to low key civilian life. &nbsp;He shares his astonishment for the highly entertaining performances of Hiroki Hara showcasing his talent as an illusionist.</p>

<p>She clicked the link and was immediately transported to a fairy tale existence of magic and illusion. &nbsp;In no time she got up and informed her campaign of her decision to include green screen magic into her presidential campaign stops. &nbsp;The staff, true to form, worked through the night to make an epic green screen magical Hillary disappearance act possible.</p>
<p>In her first campaign appearance following her 9/11 memorial ceremony collapse near ground zero and the World Trade Center Towers 1,2, and 7 she decided the time was right in Greensboro, NC to unveil her digital performance. &nbsp;While the beginning of the show had subtle irregularities in that she was able to shield her presence from recording iPhones she upped her game considerably near the end of her speech. &nbsp;In a preseidetial campaign first she was able to partially disappear. &nbsp;The two dozen onlookers in person didn't catch the magic, but in the footage that followed viewers were stunned as the former First Lady disappeared from the live feed only to come back minutes later. &nbsp;(The magic act begins at 20:51)</p>

<p>CNN reports they will be running another poll early next week and assure the Clinton Campaign she will be back ahead again by a moderate lead at that time.</p>
