<p>When I grew up I remember reading the Berenstein Bears. &nbsp;When I looked up the books it appears all the books have the answer Berenstain Bears now. &nbsp;What do you folk remember?</p>
<p>Apparently, people that recall this as well are experiencing this thing called the Mandela Effect. &nbsp;Turns out there are lots of things like this. &nbsp;There is a list on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/">Reddit </a>and on this <a href="http://mandelaeffect.com/">website</a>.</p>
<p>Creepy. &nbsp;What else has changed for you?</p>
