Here are the 32 contestants for STEEMFEST MINNOW.  These folks have created a post and submitted it in the comments of the previous STEEMFEST MINNOW post.  Please read these posts.  If you want one of them to be a finalist then please make an individual comment for them with only their steemit handle.  So, for example, if I want aggroed to get the all expense paid trip to STEEMFEST then I'd write a comment and only leave "@aggroed" in it.  That's one vote for aggroed.  5 people with the most unique mentions by unique commenters will be guaranteed a finalist contender spot.  

I'll announce finalists on Thursday and work with several judges to collect scores of those 10 accounts and choose 1 winner for the all expense paid trip.The winner as well as 1st and 2nd runner up will be announced on Monday a week from today on the @minnowsupport wall.  The weekly resteem will start again then too through the @minnowsupport account.
