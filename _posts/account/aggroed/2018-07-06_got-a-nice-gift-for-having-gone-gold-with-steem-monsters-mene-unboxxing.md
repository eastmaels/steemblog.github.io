I'm not a fancy guy.  My friends who have known me for 30 years call me uncultured.  Apparently citing pathfinder rules doesn't count as "culture."  Anyway, @goldmatters sent me a pretty awesome gift.  It's a little sculptured gold.  You can see what he sent and why he sent it in the unboxxing below.  I did this in two takes.  I found the little gold piece, but I didn't realize that there were notes and other pieces to the fancy gift box.  

A couple of things about this.  I honestly did feel like a million bucks opening this.  It's packaged beautifully.  My kids are in the background holding their mouths shut so they don't go dropping a million ooohs and aaaahs.  They were stoked.  I'm clearly pleased.  I don't dig on fancy, but this made me think twice about it because the whole experience was quite nice.

The other thing was that a friend of mine growing up had a Picasso in her house.  He was pretty prolific so it's not like those are million dollar pieces, but I've wanted one since I was in 9th grade.  These pieces are designed by Picasso's grand daughter.  It's a Picasso.  I'm not sure that would count for anyone else, but I think it's cool af.

## Opening the first round

## I had to come back and film again after I realized there was more in there

## Gold as a business

It was interesting to talk to @goldmatters some more after this whole thing was sent.  He's working for Mene that's trying to make it easy to use gold as a store of value.  Not just paper gold like what's traded a lot in the USA, but actual real life solid gold that isn't derivatives.  They are also working on crypto storage.  So, I dream of the day that I can convert my Steem at all time highs to Gold to store the value, ride the wave down, and get more Steem after everyone else has panic sold down.  They also have a credit card system, so maybe I can buy some lunch with all this stuff at some point too.

## Gold foils lead to gold

So, I'm pretty stoked that our choice of adding gold foils to the cards has inspired this gift.  We're trying to make Steem Monsters something that will benefit this whole community.
