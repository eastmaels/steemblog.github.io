I know, I know.  "Aggroed, why are you thanking these people for anything?  They're literally ruining everything they touch, they are a 'Den of Vipers' and some evil human beings.  They created a system that isn't actually broken, but working extremely well to funnel wealth from poor people to the very same bankers you're thanking... What's wrong with you?"

## First off, it's a back handed compliment <h2>

To be clear I hate bankers.  These people suck.  I don't mean bank tellers, and the poor dopes that have to sell you mortgages.  They're just people... but the assholes in charge of this system are amazingly horrible people.  Their primary business is war profiteering and their major export is poverty and political servitude/bribery.

## BUT <h2>

If you can read this your life is benefiting from their shittiness.  That's right!  The fact that the government currencies are so bad is part of what's fueling the rise of cryptocurrencies.

You know how long it takes my bank to clear a check?  Days...

You know how long it takes crypto to clear?  Hours... unless you're Steem and then it's 3 seconds.

What about inflation?

If you're government you're actually racing other currencies to be the fastest inflater.  Apparently that's how you grow an economy as a central banker.

If you're in the crypto world your coins are deflationary.  This means that if you hold your coins for a year you should be able to purchase more goods and services next year with them then you could today!

## Delta <h2>

The real magic is looking at the Delta between these!  Delta is the difference aka you do subtraction.  It's not just that cryptos are deflationary or practically deflationary it's that we're also comparing them to currencies running as fast as they can to inflate.  The difference between those two things is staggering!!!

## So, why are bitcoin and the altcoins marching quickly up higher and higher which gets you a sick return on your investment? <h2>

When you have funds to invest and you look around your options are hold in cash, which is guaranteed to go down, buy some stocks that may go up a few percent, or pour some cash into cryptos and try to catch some 10x+ returns (sometimes in less than a month).  The positive returns in crypto are only possible because our competition (fiat stuff not other cryptos) is literally the dumbest plan a human could voluntarily choose to do.

## The letter <h2>

Dear asshat banksters,

You're a gang of criminals and you should all be brought up on charges of treason and Crimes Against Humanity.  You've created a giant wealth sucking system that has created poverty for millions of people on this planet while simultaneously enriching some of the biggest assholes that ever walked the face of this Earth.  On top of that the amount of fraud you've embedded in this system is nightmarishly large.  You use violence and deep state spy rings to enforce it.  You are the worst people on the planet.

If there's one thing worth thanking you for it's creating such a horrible situation that out of dire necessity the human mind has created blockchain currencies designed to circumvent your sphere of influence and provide an alternate to the highly inflated pieces of fiat dog shit you call your currency.  Blockchain is cool and it wouldn't exist if you weren't all the horrendous ass eating vultures that purposefully rob economies all over the world.

There will come a time in the not too distant future your crimes are exposed for the harm they cause and the collective will of the people on this planet will see an end to the suffering you cause with your economic strife and military weapons.  Until then, keep building your bunkers and planning for the apocalypse.   We the people, particularly those of the internet, are coming.  Your days are numbered.

Many blessings of genital herpes, 
yours truly,

Aggroed
