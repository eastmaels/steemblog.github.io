So, I've been doing 1k Sp to grow my account and 1k Sp to power down every week to help pay for bills.  It's not always mentioned but I subsidize half the cost of the minnowsupport rpc node.  I think it's an important part of being a top 20 witness.  I've also been using the powerdown to buy some of the steem monsters cards off the market, I've given some to some folks and projects in need, and helped fund the kriptojobs project.

While I've been doing that I've been steadily delegating out to various projects and people within the Minnow Support Project.  Here are the major things I delegate to-

If you divide by 2 you get a pretty close estimate of how may thousands of SP I've delegated to each project.

msp-waves is 16ksp- this is the radio station and it's auto-curating djs
lovejuice 15ksp- this is a bidbot and the incoming funds pay new authors to post content there
msp-active 15ksp- this is to support the members of the Minnow Support Community and reward people that are active chatters and hang out with us
msp-mods 15ksp- this is to reward the moderators with some minimal curation rewards for helping to run PALnet and the Minnow Support Project
msp-curation 12ksp- this is an initiative where community members manually curate great content
msp-lovebot 9ksp- this is an account that autovotes people that delegate to minnowsupport
msp-bidbot 5ksp- this is a small bid bot account where 5% of all proceeds go to minnowsupport

The rest goes to a variety of people and smaller projects and accounts that I want to help and support.

This is a major milestone for me.  This week I hit 100k steem power delegated.  This place is my home.  This is a way I can support it!

Moving forward I'm planning on leaving my delegations as they are for a while (If I pull any back it's only because prices are insane, I'll sell, and buy back when it comes back down).  I'm interested in growing the @aggroed steem power now so that my personal vote is worth more and I can curate people and projects I like better.  I'm also going to power down more of my weekly witness rewards and use it to fund a variety of projects on the block.  This will be sorta like an angel investment fund in some ways.  We'll see where it goes.  So, I'm going to stop delegating out new steem as much, and try a little less general support and focus what I'm doing on a few stand out projects.

Anyway, I'm proud of myself and I thought I'd share!  thanks all for your support of my witness and I continue to do my best to spread Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, help the Steem ecosystem grow, and train and retain minnows on the platform.  I do this through actively leading the Minnow Support Project and the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network (the largest off chain community for Steem), Steem Monsters which is a collectible trading card drafting game progressing from alpha to beta with fighting, and msp-waves the radio station that we listen to.

## Witness Stuff

I'm rocking 19.12.  I was a little slower than my colleagues at this, but I was a little nervous after some of the bugs that were found in .11.  But I'm here, it's working well, and I'm excited to be switching over to HF20 about a month from now.  GOOD TIMES!  I support app-base and think it's a great step in the right direction to reduce the hardware necessary to run the Steem blockchain.

## General Thanks

I couldn't do this without the people who support my witness, fantastic moderators who help run the day to day business of the Minnow Support Project, my business partner Yaba, or all the community members that hang out with us on air and in Discord.  You truly are all lovely people and I feel blessed daily to be on this crypto journey with you.

Best Regards,

Aggy
