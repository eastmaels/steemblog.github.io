This Saturday at 11am EST (1600 UTC) I'll be hosting a Steem witness forum.  This is a chance for top 20 witnesses on the platform to share what's important to them.

## Which witness will be on? <h2>
@jesta (chainbb, steemdb, vessel)
@good-karma (esteem)
@roelandp (Steemfest)
@aggroed (Minnow Support Project)
@anyx (Steem Cleaners)
@ausbitbank (Minnow Support Project)
@lukestokes (Exchange Transfer Report)
@someguy123 (Privex)

and similar to the Steem block chain I'm introducing a rotating backup witness into the lineup.  This panel discussion will also feature backup witness @followbtcnews (@followbtcnews co-runs his witness with @crimsonclad).

## Format <h2>

There isn't a ton of structure to being a witness or working as a team of witnesses.  By hosting these I'm trying to give witnesses a chance to air thoughts on the current state of steem, projects folks are working on, platform needs, and what the future holds for us all.  To help inform one another of what we're all working on I'm inviting other top 20 witnesses to come on a panel and just share their thoughts.  I'll provide Steem related question prompts to the panel and they'll get time to answer questions as they see fit or the spirit strikes them.

## Logistics <h2>

Show starts at 11am this Saturday January 20th.

To join it please hop into the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord server home to the Minnow Support Project](minnowpond.org)
