The Boston meetup was a success.  I'll share more details shortly.  I have a variety of posts to make and that I'm behind on.  Se la Vie.  Ok, onto my last project of the day: THE PEACE ACADEMY!

# <center> The Peace Academy with @aggroed and @isaria </center>

Ok, this is crazy....we are already up to Episode 20!

Last week @isaria was out of town so I had @r0nd0n on the show to talk about Liberty.

This week I want to talk a bit about victim mentality....how to become more empowered and also how to deal with others who exhibit victim mentality and other toxic behaviors.

I've also experienced the passing of a loved one this week so we may talk about dealing with grief as well.

An abundance discussion may also be in order as I've noticed a bit of negativity in the air here and there.
This is often a result of having a scarcity mindset which is fear based.
Let's spend some time focusing on all the positive that is going on around us here on Steemit.



Looking forward to seeing you all tonight!

**_We also want to hear from you!_**

Be sure to join the audience chat during the show and let us know if you want to come on air with us!  
As long as what you have to say is about Peace, Abundance, or Liberty it's fair game!
