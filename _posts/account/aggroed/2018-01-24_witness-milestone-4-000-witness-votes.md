Well, it's that time again to write another milestone post.  I didn't dream that I'd make it into the top 20 witnesses.  Frankly these guys even just in the 1 year I was here before I started my campaign were already sorta legendary to me.  I came with no crypto background, not a single friend on the platform, I was earning 7 cents in 5 posts, and I was writing about weird shit like the Mandela Effect.  What a difference a year can make.

## This time I'll put them front and center! <h2>

![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmaZAj93zA7okAww8ie52Azosaev4YdomzmGGfhrmenXiR/image.png)

Often times I put the whales that support me at the very back of the post.  This time it's at the front.  Look, the reality is that the distribution on the platform is pretty centralized.  100 accounts control 93% of the steem or more.  I wouldn't be in this position without whale support.  I'm grateful for that support and am especially proud that the millionaires on this platform find value in supporting me.  I imagine a lot of that has to do with running the Minnow Support Project, which is about to cross 10k members!!! (9757 currently.  It'll be this week)

![Distribution.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcN5DLson3TCPp33Foi5KRHmLjMLXvncdhAUWsC6voD3s/Distribution.png)

That's the reality... for now.  I think as the price of steem goes up the devs that started this place will sell some off because it will represent too high a portion of their networth and we'll see a slightly better distribution on the platform as a whole.

## Steem is mooning this year! <h2>

This market is a few weeks away from completing the correction.  It will start marching back up well past all time highs like it's been doing for the last many years.  When that happens zounds of people are going to pour in looking to strike it rich with crypto gold.  All of the PoS coins are going to get overloaded by the influx of people since many of them can't handle it now.  BTC is at max capacity.  BCH will hit it.  BCG will hit it.  LTC will hit it.  Fuck, even DOGE will hit it (we are in the Chinese year of the Doge).  Every PoS coin will be capped and over max capacity and everyone will be losing their shit.

Steem will be sitting here like "Yeah, we're good for 2019 too!"

## Super bullish <h2>

Many crypto experts are calling for $100k BTC by years end.  I'm with them.  If we do nothing other than keep pace with btc we'll be a $50 coin.  If we outpace btc because we can scale it'll be larger than that.  Some folks think I'm excessively bullish to the point of crazy.  I think we are following metcalfe's law as did the telephone, fax machines, and facebook.  That means we grow the user base at 100x values and grow the currency value by 10x values.  I think we're going to go pure huge.

## [Weiss Report](http://finance.weissratings.com/crypto/) <h2>

Part of that is because the Weiss Report, which is the first crypto currency ranking system came out and ranked us higher than BTC.  We just got a B-.  BTC got a C+.  No coin got an A.  I'm not the only one that sees how good this coin is.

## MSP has a simple charter <h2>

When I realized the potential of Steem I started dedicating as much time as I could on the platform.  I hold the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty as core central values.  I created a Discord channel along with @ausbitbank, @teamsteem, and @canadian-coconut.  And after catching some resteems from @kaylinart and @fyrstikken early in my growth cycle I realized the potential of simple acts of kindness on the platform.  I started a resteem contest, put that on a new account I created called @minnowsupport and the Minnow Support Project was born.  That was a crypto eon ago in June of last year.

## MSP has an amazing team <h2>

The growth of the Steem blockchain is put together by many people.  This place takes all kinds of skill groups to find success.  I think the Witnesses are top notch people.  I'm pleased that a subsection of those folks help run the Minnow Support Project and another subsection of them [delegate steem to the minnowsupport project](https://mspdelegator.herokuapp.com/mspdelegator).  

Here are witnesses that have been involved with this project and support it through various amounts of management or services to the community.

Here are the Sr. Moderators that help manage the 9700+ Steemian [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel](minnowpond.org).

And we're also run by a team of gifted moderators who are constantly engaged in growing the MSP and Steem community.  If you're wondering why you're not always overrun by help requests and long chats trying to figure out how Steem works then look no further.  These are the guys that are onboarding thousands of people!!!

If you're looking for people to support that do wonders for the Steem ecosystem than look no further to that team.

## A special love shoutout to @swelker101 and @gmuxx <h2>

These are two moderators that have started witness campaigns.  They are still very early in their progress.  I would encourage people to vote for them.  @swelker101 is the first moderator of the Minnow Support Project and has been a go to for stability and advice for me since I started the project.  I'm incredibly grateful to his help.  He runs multiple Steem based radio shows on msp-waves.  He has his own discord group called [Minnow University](https://discord.gg/V2WWEmx) that aims to teach people the steps they need to understand and grow within the Steem ecosystem.  And he's a really charming and funny guy.

@gmuxx was the second moderator to start at the Minnow Support Project.  He's one of the most active chatters on the server and has since started a second and very successful group along with @rhondak called the [Writer's Block](https://discord.gg/hcPuvDe).  If you think fiction, poetry, screenplays, and plays have a place on the Steem than I think you should consider voting for him to help his community.

## The future is so bright here! <h2>

I'm incredibly grateful to this community.  I'm excited to be a part of it.  I plan to keep all my efforts aligned to mission of the Minnow Support Project: Spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, help the Steem ecosystem grow, and train and retain new members on the platform.  Thank you for your support and thank you for your witness votes that have allowed me to delegate back to community projects and community members.

## Special thanks to @elear <h2>

He recently sent 1000 Steem and delegated 3000 SP to the Minnow Support Project!  Thank you sir for your contribution to the project!

## I'm still working on PAL-Studios <h2>

These things take some time, but I'm trying to finalize a studio space this week.  More to come hopefully soon.  The project is to have a starting film studio dedicated to spreading the Steem ecosystem and values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  I'll start by hosting talking head shows and try to get others in there doing the same as well.  This is to say that the mission isn't going to change with higher Steem and SBD prices.  It's just going to scale higher!  Should be fun!

## This goes well with msp-waves, an internet streaming broadcast network <h2>
We host radio shows and programs in Discord and we broadcast them on mspwaves.com.  It's small now while Steem is still small, but as the price goes up and people come in droves we're going to be at the center of cryptomedia.  I'm so proud to have started this and to see it grow.

I'd like to give a special shoutout to @globocop, @r0nd0n, @crimsonclad, @meno for really being the brunt force of the opps team.  @uniwhisp, @kubbyelizibeth, and @jesse2you play great roles helping it to stay organized and awesome.  And of course the DJs!!

## Hang in there for some Steem Monsters! <h2>

![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmTfXDt7e8fzNpaLaBUfqcAyf4VaccBpB1JkKghhvj9PAG/image.png)

I have a game coming to the Steem Ecosystem before too long.  Maybe this or next week we'll start some presales.  Should be fun :)

## If it isn't clear what I do here: I manage people and projects that grow the Steem ecosystem! <h2>

Please consider voting for me as well if you haven't already and please support @minnowsupport.

Namaste and with Love,

Aggroed
