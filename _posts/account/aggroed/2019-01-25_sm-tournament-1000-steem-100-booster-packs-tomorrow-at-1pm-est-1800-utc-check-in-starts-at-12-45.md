I'm running a 1000 steem diamond level tournament tomorrow.  There are 100 booster packs for those that stream it and those are that playing in it. 

You can find the tournament details here: https://challonge.com/r39i5otv

There's been thousands of steem, boosters, cards, and sbd up for grabs all throughout January.  If you aren't playing Steem Monsters you're missing out on a great way to earn crypto!
