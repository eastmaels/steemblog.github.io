There is a long story about only two ways to have enough.  One is the unending conquest to have more.  More money, more sex, more house, more status, more whatever.  The other is simply to declare that you now have enough, and draw a line for yourself that this is the point where you're willing to be satisfied.

I'm a dude.  Just a plain normal dude.  If it wasn't for wife and children i could live in a tent.  Worst case a dorm.  I like being fed, but I don't need much space above a bed, a computer desk, a bathroom, and a communal kitchen.

That said, I have more than enough.  I'm lucky enough to be a phd with 20 years of experience.  I've been a college professor.  I'm a lucky guy.  The challenge is no longer having enough.  The two options presented from what I grew up with don't seem to work.  The question always struck me as a material wealth thing.  Always in the constant struggle for more money to buy whatever.  I'm not much interested in that.  Actually, I kinda hate it.

The world is run by immoral banksters, and every time, literally every single time, I do any transaction or hold onto one of their fiat debt notes I know that I empower them.  This is a crushing realization to me.  When I pay my mortgage, taxes, energy bill, buy gas, or do anything with their notes I give them power.  Power that I know they missue mostly to kill dark skinned people in third world nations to take resources that don't belong to them.  It's a wicked system.  My answers are to make daily change to not consent and to not participate.

I'm bummed I don't have a Mayflower I can hop onto and find a new world.  I suppose I could do what the US forefathers did and just find a different spot and murder everyone there, but I have this stout belief in the importance of peace.  But then too the most recent Mad Max movie has my brain all twisted.  They go through literal hell to escape an oppressive shithouse dictatorship only to turn around to take it back over because you gotta clean up where you came from.  Have you seen the sprawling government that impacts trillions of dollars... how the fuck do you clean that up?

Anyway, despite wanting to earn some stake around here my end game isn't wealth.  What would I do with it?  I just want to live peacefully in a shitty dorm room with a nice comp.  It's not like it's that expensive a lifestyle.  So, I'm not pursuing economically speaking a financial enough.  I'm pursuing a world where I can say I've done enough to change it.  I suppose I could just be content with what's around me, but there's this burning passion inside to leave something different.  Every night as I went to bed my mother would say "Leave this place better than you found it."  The message is right and its advice I'll gladly follow.

I guess my ultimate fear is to myself and to my one day woke ass kids.  They'll turn to me and say "dad, you knew about the way the world works?  What did you do about it?"  I want an answer worthy of the beauty they bring to my world.  Maybe that day won't come, and I'm just pressuring myself... idk... but for now it isn't enough.

This world is broken, it has to change, and that change has to start with me.  Until it does change I don't think it'll be enough.  So, I'll see you tomorrow.  And the next day.  And the next day.  When my kids and your kids can hold hands around the world and live with peace, abundance, and liberty I'll call it quits.  Until then I have this idea I've been thinking about...
