You guys probably recognize the start of the declaration of independence.  

>When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

You might even recognize this next line
>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 

So, those are the first two lines.  Everyone celebrates those, but often times the rest of it is ignored.  The end of the second paragraph is the colonist prepping to air their grievances.

>The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

And the Grievances are many.  What shocked me upon reading this again was how many of these would be just as true today as they were back then.  I'll take some out, but look how long this list is that still makes perfect sense!  Just change "He" to "Congress" or "The Deep State" and this thing is clear as day.

## Standing Rock <h2>
>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

## Late night roll calls, lack of federal holidays for voting <h2>
> He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

## Anti-immigration, which is when not intentionally lined with drug dealers and terrorist cells is a good thing <h2>
> He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

## Every fucking alphabet agency in the USG <h2> 
> He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.

## We've been at war 225+ years out of 250, we occupy a few dozen countries <h2>
> He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

## Industrial military complex basically does whatever the fuck it wants <h2>
> He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.

## United Nations, Agenda 21 <h2>
> He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

## Abu Grave <h2>
> For protecting them (troops), by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

## Fucked up trade agreements <h2>
> For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

## 40% enough yet? <h2>
> For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

## Cop killings <h2>
> For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:

## Free Julian <h2>
> For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:

## Classic Latin America and Middle Eastern Policy now <h2>
> For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies

## Don't smoke'm if you got'm because the DEA is coming anyways <h2>
> For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

## Still Marijuana laws <h2>
> For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

## Have you seen Detroit? <h2>
> He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

## We fund ISIS, 9/11 was an inside job <h2>
> He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

## Paid political rioters <h2>
> He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

## So, they go on to say "Piss Off!" <h2>
>Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. — And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.

## We should consider the same <h2>
@dantheman was talking about a constitution in his posts.  If you want to go old school then the step before the Constitution is to describe openly and unapologetic why you're leaving and how you have the right to leave in a public Declaration.  

I personally want to create a voluntaryist community through crypto where 50% of inflation/mining rewards go to a common pool that can be used for community projects in lieu of taxes/taxation.  It would be kind of like a Bitshares approach on steroids with a kickstarter community project page to go with it.  I've thought of it as PALnet or Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network.  We print the money... why do we need to steal taxes from the user base?  Why do we need to be georaphically defined?  This is the internet... We don't need no stinkin' boarders here.

## True Freedom is out there.  We as a community have the power to wield it. <h2>
