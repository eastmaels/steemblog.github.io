After another full day of vote grovelling @aggroed sits tiredly and with glazed eyes by the side of the road as Satirically Yours asks him a few key questions on his witness campaign...

SY: So, @aggroed, how's the campaign trail treating you?

@aggroed: My tung is thore frum all ths bootlickn...  (to be clear, he has a lisp in the following bit)

SY:  that's somewhat hard to hear can you try again?

@aggroed: I thaid!  My TUNG is THORE frum all this BOOTLICKN

SY:  yes, well that does seem like a nasty part of the job when you're running for a public position.  Here, have some water.

@aggroed: Thank you.  Yeth, well, the campaign is doing ok.  I've managed to break into Witneth 62.  It's taken a fair amount of time athking people for their votes.

SY: What's been your major push?  How have you managed to get that far in just 3 days as a relatively unknown Dolphin?

@aggroed:  Well, I thtarted with thome withneth posts about my valueth of **Peace, Abundance, and Liberty**.  That only got me so far.   I instead turned to a rather non-political approach.  I promised to do better than the 8 dead witnesses still higher than me on the list.

SY:  Excuse me?  Here, I think another sip might fix your lisp.

@aggroed:   Ahhh, thank you.  Yes, well, if you go to the witness page conveniently located at the top of this page under my avatar image you'll notice that there are literally 8 dead witnesses that are above me.  Some that are still rockin' Hardfork 14-16.  We're on 18 and about to launch 19...  Maybe having them on there isn't such a detriment, but I think it's says a little more about this place if the top witnesses are all live accounts.

While I might not be the perfect advocate for this place, and I may have a minor history of disparaging leadership decisions for things like infinitely inflating steem and creating a pretty non-ok distribution of SP on the site; I do think I can say with confidence that my efforts to form community and help minnows will be better than having witness accounts that are no longer functional.  

Honestly, what we want is some people that aren't afraid to take a risk and say "what we're doing isn't working the right way now."  I think I may have frustrated a few people that I did that through satire... they may even follow this blog, but it's important to have a dialogue going about what is and is not working.

So, here's my new campaign ad!

SY:  Wow, that's really fantastic.  Did it take you all day to make?

@aggroed: No, about 6 minutes while making this post.

SY:  No joke, I wouldn't have guessed less than 8 minutes.  Fine work I'm sure it will attract many people to your campaign.  There you have it.  @aggroed is making his way steadily on the witness campaign trail.

You can find me hanging out  on steemspeak, a discord channel that many steemers use to text and talk to each other- https://discord.gg/qjpRj7w or my new channel PALnet- https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw
I can also be found on steemchat as @aggroed.  If you have a post to share give me a good sentence or two of why you think Iâ€™ll like it.
