The theme of Episode 23 was Abundance.
We had @clayboyn on the show to discuss the future of Steemit and how we can all share in the abundance created by Steem.


We talked about SMT's and how they will help minnows.

Not everyone on Steemit is an expert on crypto so I gave a bit of history with the timeline from Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, to Steem.

SMT's will allow people to create their own coins.
It will be like restarting Steem from day 1, but with your own distribution
You can think of it like selling shares of your own company.
Any group or individual can start a coin.

So for example, if I start a Minnow Support coin, anyone who has very little steem can easily become Minnow Support whale as long as that coin gains value. 
Individuals or communities with a large following will likely have coins that will increase in value.
