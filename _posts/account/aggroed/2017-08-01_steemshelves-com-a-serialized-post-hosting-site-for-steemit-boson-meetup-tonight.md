I've been advocating to make serialized posts on here forever.  My own first series was Aggroed's Antidote followed by Meme The News and I've added others.  I have a witness series, I have a graphic novel I'm building in Nagan VII, and I have STEEMIT TIPS.  Serializing posts is a way to connect with your audience and keep them with you, but to be honest, the wall is a very obnoxious way to store these.  The wall is basically an infinite list of every post you made or resteemed in chronological order.  So, if someone wants to read Nagan VII start to finish I either have to post every link every time which is a growing pain in the butt, or they have to go through my entire wall.  Especially since Nagan VII started as a flash fiction post rather than a Nagan VII entitled series you wouldn't even be able to find them all.

## That's why the Steemit Platform needs steemshelves.com. <h2>

With Steemshelves you can can go to the site and check out some of your favorite authors on the platform and check out all of their posts in a serialized manner.

So, Here's the site itself- http://www.steemshelves.com/

Then you can search by authors who have signed up http://www.steemshelves.com/aggroed/

Then you can find the individual series- http://www.steemshelves.com/nagan-vii/

## Well, what about signing up as a author?    <h2>

That's simple.  You fill out a form to get started, and then all you have to do is send links in a transfer with 2 SBD to @sft.

## This is moderator project of the Minnow Support Project!!! <h2>

What you may not realize is that this project is primarily run by @rhondak.  It's an offshoot of the Steemhouse Fiction Trail, which is an independant curation trail within the Minnow Support Community. It's a baby of the fiction writer's workshop, which is where new steemit authors can go to learn from published writers who dedicate time to help newbies in there.

MSP continues to be a source of code, community, and we're helping people to author better content every day.

Simply put:  If you're not in the PALnet Discord room; home of the Minnow Support Project, then you're Steeming wrong!
