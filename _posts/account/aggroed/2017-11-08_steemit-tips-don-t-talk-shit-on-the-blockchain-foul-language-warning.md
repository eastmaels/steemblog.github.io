Ok, so, this doesn't have a direct story attached to it.  It's just good advice.  Here's the thing.  Did your mom ever tell you something to the effect of "Watch what you say! You can't take words back?"  It's an important thought.  The next level shit of that is watch what you type because you can't take words back on a highly distributed blockchain and potentially for all time history will record you as a shit talkin' a-hole.  My advice... skip the shit talk.

## Steemit rewards being a good neighbor <h2>

There's this thing called reputation.  It's the number next to your name.  Mine is 70 (almost 71).  It means that I've gotten a lot of post rewards without catching many flags.  It means a lot of people have upvoted my stuff, and it's a sign that this community generally doesn't think I'm an asshole.  It also means I'm a trusted person on the platform.  It also means I have a lot to lose if I behave badly.

The curation curve does some weird things.  When you comment you get rewards.  If you comment fairly early on a post and others (particularly whales) pile on after you the amount that you earn through curation actually goes up.  Whales are less likely to invest their votes into posts on people that have low reputations because they are less likely to see the return on their curation rewards go up.  So, without thinking about social consequences or quality of posts or things of that nature whales prefer to upvote high rep accounts.  So, if you're looking to grow you want your rep as high as possible.

## What ruins a good rep score?  <h2>

Did you guess it?  Shit talking!  Ever wonder why Steemit isn't filled with the same kind of racist, ignorant, obnoxious stream of shit that you find on most social media?  It's because flagging exists and people can cause you financial damage if you're talking shit about them or acting like a total asshole.  So, here's some advice (and this goes for on Discord too because Discord saves your chats forever, though it is easier to erase), don't run around talking shit on the block.

## Does that mean I can't say anything negative?  <h2>

Guys, this is **Do no harm, but take no shit land**.  If someone is acting like an asshole call them out for their behavior but not them as a person.  You have every right on this platform to defend yourself not only with words, but down votes too.  Here's the thing though.  When you're defending you have to be careful not to go on offense.

EX:  Someone calls me or MSP a scammer on the block.

First they are already breaking the rule of don't talk shit...

Good response:  Hey dude, that's a frustrating position for you to take.  The Minnow Support Project is made up of over 600 delegators and run by half a dozen top 30 publicly elected witnesses.  We take great care to be transparent in our goals and how this place runs.  I think you really ought to double check the information you have because it's completely inaccurate.  (it's been a few months thankfully since me or MSP has been called a scam).

Bad response:  Look here fucker.  You're clearly an ignorant shit.  Just look at the fucking block you ass licking moron.  Any half brained asshat, even you, can look at the block with publicly available tools and see that roughly 80-90% of the curation goes to 1600 different accounts that manually use the bots (breaking character: 10% stays on minnowsupport because it upvotes it's own posts).  So, how bout you go fuck yourself and your mother while you're at it.

Both of those responses get across that me and MSP aren't scams, but the second one is probably gonna catch some flak.  One of the most frustrating things I've seen on the platform is that any time I lose my cool and really let an asshole have it others on the block rallly to their defense.  It's actually really cool, but at that moments it's infuriating.  Anyway, the point here is that if someone is talking shit about you you're free to fire back some responses and share how they are wrong and how you don't consent to what they are saying.  If you cross the line and start making personal attacks against them then just get ready for unintended consequences because this platform will strike back.

This post created on mspsteem.com.  Its a clone of steemit except run by MSP (thanks @netuoso for hosting it).  It also provides back 5% beneficiaries to @minnowsupport.   Lastly I personally only really curate off of people that use mspsteem.com and use the tag mspsteem.
