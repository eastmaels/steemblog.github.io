Hello from the Splinterlands.  I'm happy to show off this albeit brief starting point for some animation.  I thought you'd like to see that it's just now coming together.  Characters have already been computerized and animation is starting to creep out now.  I'm hopeful we're still on target for the start of September as that's also when the Kickstarter campaign rolls out.

This is short, but a lot of work had to happen to get here. Now I think more pieces can start rolling out faster.

A note from the artist/animator- "I'm Kiy, the lead animator for this project!  These shots of Talia were animated using both puppet and hand-drawn techniques, which allows the animation to look lively and energetic while still being quick and efficient to produce."

"I'm Gabriel, The Director and  Storyboard Artist. Because we don't have a big Hollywood budget I wanted to make sure every scene had top-notch drawing and staging and were just fun to look at. 
I wanted to make sure the action scenes stood alone as cool art, add cool FX animation and I think we have something that is exciting to view.   "

What I really need to know is if you guys can dig this art and this style.  I've written several more 1-2 minute videos into the kickstarter and am looking at spending 10s of thousands of dollars to roll out some animations.  I know it's not a ton to go off of, but can you see this working?

Please comment below.  We'll use a 1-5 scale.  If you think it's an amazing start please put a 5 in a comment, if you think it's terrible and will hurt us to release please put a 1 in a comment.
