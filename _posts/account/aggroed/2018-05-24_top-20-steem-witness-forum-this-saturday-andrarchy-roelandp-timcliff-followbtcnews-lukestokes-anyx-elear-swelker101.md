It's my great pleasure to once again announce and host the once monthly Top 20 Steem Witness Forum.  I have another all star cast of Witness favorites on the list.

@andrachy from Steemit will kick us off detailing some of the updates from Steemit HQ.  They recently put out a pretty big update on progress for a variety of blockchain backbone code improvements.  While some of this isn't sexy yet it's absolutely critical blockchain improvements to allow us to expand and meet mainstream adoption.  Exciting times lie ahead and I'm stoked to hear about that and other Steemit news and views from their Director of Content!




## Big update from Steemit

## Then it's time to talk to the witnesses!

The all star cast is 
@roelandp best known for his work with Steemfest
@timcliff best known for his work on github, and the steem.chat help desk
@aggroed- host of the show, founder of the Minnow Support Project and founder of MSP-Waves a Steem centric radio broadcast featuring Steemix- an around the clock broadcast of Steemian created music- and now home to 30+ radio shows for 60 hours a week of content
@followbtcnews best known for hosting steem.chat, a highly active Minnow Support Project witness, and a variety of tools the public can access that make Steeming better
@lukestokes best known for the exchange transfer report and a steady dedication on the chain to translating tech speak to laymen friendly terms
@anyx best known for cheetah and help keeping spam at bay

## Backup Witnesses-
Just like the Steem Blockchain itself I try to rotate in backup witnesses into the Top 20 witness discussions. 
@elear best known for the creation of utopian-io
@swelker101 the first moderator of the Minnow Support Project, creator of Minnow University, and recent addition to the team of witnesses strategically guiding the Minnow Support Project

## Logistics
Show starts at 11am EST in the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw).  I'll spin some hits from the 90s starting around 10:30 while folks gather round.

If you're going to be on air please be sure to have a mic and headset working.  The big thing is don't have your speaker sounds heading into your mic because the feedback is terrible.  Also, please show up a little early to audio test and make sure you're good to go on air.

## Aggy's secret update-  Steem Monsters!

I'll talk some more about this during the show, but the alpha release of Steem Monsters is now live.  You can find us at steemmonsters.com.  You can buy packs for the account you use to pay, see your monsters in the beastiary, and collect duplicates

We're (@yabapmatt and @aggroed) are planning  on releasing the ability to trade cards, increase their level by combining cards of the same type, buy packs for others hopefully by the end of June.

We'll have fighting and tournaments ready to go we expect within 3 months.  I'm working on putting a kickstarter project together to pull some attention to this from the broader internet community.

## General Guidelines

PALnet doesn't police thoughts, but we do police how people interact with one another.  You're welcome to disagree and share any thought that you want regarding plans and policies of the witnesses, steemit, and the other audience members, but we don't have a lot of tolerance for people that can't disagree politely.  Ask questions, share thoughts, point to facts and evidence, but please be respectful especially while heated and especially while sharing a different opinion!

## Looking forward to having you there this Saturday!

Should be fun, should be lots of news to share, should be cool projects to talk about, and I'm excited to hear what's going on!

Aggy
