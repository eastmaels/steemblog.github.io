<p>Satirically Yours Fake News Correspondent @aggroed was able to sit down with the former President for a candid interview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>@aggroed- Mr. President. &nbsp;Thank you so much for your time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;GW- Sure, life's been'a'whole lot easier since I got out of office. &nbsp;I got time for this and some other new things in my life.</p>
<p>@aggroed- That's excellent. &nbsp;What stands out as new?</p>
<p>GW- Well, you know, actually, me and Laura started doing Yoga together. &nbsp;My heart rate is down. &nbsp;My flexibility is up. &nbsp;I'm feeling great. &nbsp;My teacher is this old Indian guy. &nbsp;I can't pronounce his name. &nbsp;I just call him "Teach."<br>
</p>

<p>@aggroed- that sounds delightful. &nbsp;I know that Yoga has loosened up my back a ton. &nbsp;Anything else?</p>
<p>GW-Sure. &nbsp;I've been working on my paintings too. &nbsp;You know trying to relax. &nbsp;Especially with all the negativity in politics these days it's so important to find some peace and quiet. &nbsp;Did you ever see my work?</p>
<p><img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iur/?f=1&amp;image_host=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent.animalnewyork.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fbush-art.jpg&amp;u=http://animalnewyork.com/wp-content/uploads/bush-art.jpg" width="1280" height="720"/>@aggroed- No, I haven't seen that before. &nbsp;Wow, it's great to see those. &nbsp;You did those while you were in office or are these new?</p>
<p>GW- Those were from the good ol' days as pres. &nbsp;Guccifer was kind enough to leak all the paintings I did. &nbsp;It was a kinda warning to the world that he had the photos and could release more stuff. &nbsp;It freaked Dicky and Rummy out. &nbsp;You shoulda seen them! &nbsp;I guess I lucked out because a lot of the emails that Guccifer was looki' for weren't in my email. &nbsp;They were between Dicky, Rummy, Colin, and Condi. &nbsp;I guess I didn't have any of the stuff Guccifer was lookin' for.</p>
<p>@aggroed- Well, what do you think he was looking for when he hacked your emails?</p>
<p>GW- Well, I'll tell you. I don't know. &nbsp;My friends at the yoga class keep telling me he was looking for evidence that Dicky and Rummy planned that whole 9/11 collapse. &nbsp;I read the 9/11 commission report. &nbsp;At the time I was absolutely certain that the twin towers came down because of those 2 planes, but now I'm not so sure...</p>
<p>@aggroed- really? &nbsp;That's shocking that a former US President would question the narrative that came out during your own administration. &nbsp;What's got you thinking?</p>
<p>GW- Well, after talking to Norma from Yoga about it for a while a few things don't make sense. &nbsp;Did you see where flight 93 crashed? &nbsp;It was a big dang hole in the ground, but where's the plane? &nbsp;I sent this question to Condi about it, but she never got back to me.</p>

<p>GW- I mean do you see a plane? &nbsp;I sure don't!</p>
<p>@aggroed- Wow, ok. &nbsp;Well, what do you think happened?</p>
<p>GW- I don't know! &nbsp;That's the whole thing, but I don't know. &nbsp;Every time I see a plane crash there is a plane. &nbsp;The whole dang thing doesn't just disintegrate. &nbsp;Laura says I should just let it go.... Let it go, you know, like in Frozen. &nbsp;But this thing is bugging me. &nbsp;Did you see where a plane hit the pentagon?</p>
<p>@aggroed- I haven't to much at those photos... what do you see there?</p>
<p>GW- Well, it's the same dang thing. &nbsp;You look at photos right after a plane flew into that building and it's like "WHAT! &nbsp;Where's the dang plane!"</p>
<p>Here's the photo I sent to brother Colin, but he was out golfing and never got back to me.</p>

<p>@aggroed- &nbsp;that's fascinating, but couldn't a building swallow a plane? &nbsp;I mean that's reinforced steel and the plane is just aluminum, maybe it got smashed.</p>
<p>GW- Yeah, well, that's what I was thinkin' at first, but the engines are steel. &nbsp;Where are those? &nbsp;Hell, where's a wing? &nbsp;It went through 3 layers of that building and I don't see anything resembling a plane.</p>
<p>@aggroed- wow this is fascinating!</p>
<p>GW- Oh wait, it gets better. &nbsp;You ever hear about building 7?</p>
<p>@aggroed- No, what's that?</p>
<p>GW- Building 7 is a building that wasn't even hit by a plane and still went down! &nbsp;I mean, it wasn't even hit by a plane. &nbsp;The commission report says it was just office fires, but no one I know believes that at all. &nbsp;Look at this. &nbsp;It goes at free fall speed and falls into it's own footprint. &nbsp;Now that I'm looking at it and not thinking Osama is just gonna jump out at me I'm thinking maybe there were explosives in there.</p>

<p>@aggroed- I never thought about that. &nbsp;I'll look into it for sure.</p>
<p>GW- What makes me mad is I was'askin' Dicky about it. &nbsp;He told me to shut up and leave it alone. &nbsp;I mean, what kind of response is that? &nbsp;I keep messaging him on facebook and twitter about it, but he won't say anything about it. &nbsp;Oh, hey Laura is signalling me that Yoga is about to start! &nbsp;You wanna come?</p>
<p>@aggroed- No thanks, but I appreciate your time and will look into the links you sent.</p>
