I'm primarily a blogger on here.  I have a small amount invested, but basically I'm here to learn and blog.  What I want as a blogger is expensive steem.  Why?  Because when steem is high the rewards for blogging are high so I make more money.  Does everyone want high steem?  Not necessarily.

There are a handful of classes of people that are using Steemit right now.  I would argue the major classes are: founders, long term investors, short term investors, bloggers, merchants, and friends.  

Founders have the long term goal of making money and the short term goal of paying their bills.  I don't see a lot of money collected by the system, so they use the fat @steemit account to pay off the bills.  Ironically, this approach hurts their ability to do that.  Yesterday for example $154k of steem hit their account.  That's more than double the whole volume of steem sold on poloniex.  Having that much excess steem is bad for price because it will drive the value of steem down.  That's bad for the founders because if they are trying to pay their bills with it they want a high price so they get more out of every steem.  The @steemit account powerdown is going to cause price distruptions for a long time because of how large that account is.  Overall, I think they want a high price of steem, but unfortunately have to act in their own disinterest and sell large amounts of it keeping the price of steem low.

The long term investors before the hardfork didn't really care about price.  Yes the price was going down, but inflation was so high that the value of their account didn't really change.  They didn't care.  Now that inflation is a tenth of what it was they don't get that influx anymore.  The long term investors want to see the price slowly and steadily rising so that they can put in government fiat currency over time and see it go up in value.  They want slow steady price increases and would likely feel they missed out if steem suddenly shot up.

Day traders want the full experience of the chaotic crypto market.  Government fiat currencies against each other may not move more than 1% a year.  Crypto fiat currencies can see that kind of change happens a couple of times between breakfast and elevensies.  Day traders want the fluctuations so they can trade off the deltas while watching the stock curve around and around.

Bloggers want high prices.  We do.  We want $100 steem so every word I right on a page is $5.  $0.16 steem is a total bummer.  My median post despite having 280 followers and a rep of 65 is like $0.50.  Great... an hours work for 1 reces peanut butter cup (not the whole candy with 2 packaged in it... literally just 1 of the two candies).

Merchants want a steady price.  They hate the crazy flucuations because they want don't want to have a dynamic pricing model.  They want a shirt to be $15 and not an algo that tracks daily fluctuations in steem and dollar value to come up with some consistant pricing mechanism.

Friends aren't here for the money.  They like the blockchain tech and the lack of censorship (minus the flagging).  They might become investors or others some day but they aren't there yet.

So, when I look at Poloniex and see we are down at $0.15 I frown and sigh.  I know the price is going to keep going down while the 3 month sell off is happening.  At some point I'll buy in along what I think is the bottom.  We're 100% in my mind going back to $0.10 steem, and I honestly think we'll go below that.  Too much steem.  Not enough buyers, which is frustrating because it likely means there aren't enough users, which likely means the price is too low.

All that is why I advocate for a 10:1 reverse split.  Get the price back to $1.60 and watch people come flock here.

Anyway, it's going down, and there will likely be little buying sprees over the next few months that I will try to sell into, but this baby is going down, down, down for the next 3 months at least.  And if the whales don't cash out at $0.10 and try to hold then it's going to linger at $0.10 or there abouts for years until something happens to magically get all the people excited about steemit somehow.
