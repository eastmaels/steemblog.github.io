Ok, I have to admit it.  I'm a fan.  This lady is pretty awesome.  She's got sass, liberty, peace, and is working on her Steem/crypto chops.  I had a good chance to talk to her for a bit.  She's still a little noobish when it comes to crypto, but she's bright as can be and I suspect she'll be a fast learner.

If you don't know her check out this intro article: https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@careywedler/i-m-carey-wedler-editor-in-chief-at-the-anti-media-youtube-personality-yoga-teacher-and-activist-i-m-joining-steemit-to-subvert

I basically do everything I can to support the charter of the Minnow Support Project.  Spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  Help Steem Grow.  Train and retain minnows on the platform.  Carey is gonna be the trifecta there.  I also talk about supporting people as much as content.  I'm personally really excited for her.  I wasn't always woke and I liked Obama for a while.  I even shamefully admit campaigning for him.  Sorry everyone.  Anyway, she was a fan too and when she realized what a bankster loving asshat he was she got ripped and tore him a new one in a piece I think went fairly viral at the time for an Obama sucks kinda post.

So, I've been following her somewhat for a few years.  She's now on Steemit.  She's cool.  I like her.  She's coming on muh show at 9pm EST this Sunday night 0200 UTC.  So, overall I'm pretty stoked for that.

Oh, and she has a following on facebook for like 100k people and another 40k something on youtube.  So, not only does she have the right mindset to be a great fit here, but she's bringing an audience with her to the platform.

So, do yourself a favor and follow @careywedler.

Then come visit the Minnow Mayor Town Hall on this Sunday night 8pm- 11pm (somtimes midnight).

## Delegation <h2>

Not quite ready to deal with delegation yet, but I'm going to change how I do delegation.  Gonna make a seaparate pool for msp-waves audience members.  So, not gonna do a delegation that night, but I'll get a 10k voting bot up and running soonish to reward regular listeners to broadcasts.  I'll also likely pull the delegations that I have to individuals when I do this, and then switch them to autovotes.

## Here's a touch of why I like this lady <h2>
