If you're using steemvoter.  And it seems 1k of you are you may want to consider dropping your rule from 100% to 25% or lower because you get 1/4 as many votes in the upcoming HF.

I dropped mine a little over 1/4 to regain some power so I can drop more upvotes worth more on comments left on posts.  If you're not using steemvoter you should really consider it.  You can find them at steemvoter.com.

Also, I just needed some tweaking to my password etc.  Customer support through steem chat with @cryptomancer was excellent.  It's a good service
