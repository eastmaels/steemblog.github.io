Minnow Mayor Town Hall is a show on msp-waves radio that I host weekly to give the public access to a top 20 witness so you can have insight into platform governance and changes coming your way.  The show is a bit of a muppet show where people are welcome to come on air and talk about whatever it is they are doing, what they want to know, promote themselves, promote a project, or literally just shoot the shit.

My agenda is transparency and answering questions.  If that's solved for the moment I default to Steem Monsters and then just whatever.

You're welcome on air.  You just need to be able to talk through discord and not be banned or an asshole.  Literally anything is worthy of discussion, but you have to maintain some basic balance in human discourse and try to not be an ass even if a topic has you amped.

show starts at 9pm est or like 60 min from when this post went out.

## I got aggroed again

Right now I'm a little triggered as I've been accused for the first time in over a year of running a scam.  I got that a lot with Minnow Support when it first started.  It's funny how it cycles back on a new successful project.  Haters gonna hate.  My response is this meme.

This game is in it's infancy.  Daily rewards and level capped tournaments are coming.  Don't miss out.  You're going to seriously regret it.
