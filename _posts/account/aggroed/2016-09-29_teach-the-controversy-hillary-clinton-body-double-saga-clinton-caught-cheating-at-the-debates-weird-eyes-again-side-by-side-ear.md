<p>Many weird happenings follow the Clintons around everywhere they go. &nbsp;in this particular one she's blatantly caught signaling debate moderator Lester Holt. &nbsp;She's clearly got a wire on her back, and as far as I can tell she's not supposed to have it. &nbsp;Her eyes go very wonky and there appears to be a sloppy edit done afterwards. &nbsp;Respect to my <a href="removingtheshackles.blogspot.ca">Removing the Shackles</a> friends who found me an ear picture to compare against a younger Hillary. &nbsp;We'll see if it matches.</p>
<p>I would appreciate your participation in the <a href="https://www.quiz-maker.com/Q0UHTP1">Hillary Clinton guessing game</a>. Please take the survey, which only takes 2 min.</p>
<p>Next, if you're new to this series it's actually the 12th post in the series. &nbsp;I also have several satirical pieces on the blog. &nbsp;Don't just dive in and say we are full of shit if you haven't watched at least the recap video and <a href="https://steemit.com/politics/@aggroed/hillary-clinton-body-double-11-day-saga-recap-video">read the story</a>.</p>

<p>Clinton freezes during airplane conference. &nbsp;Footage seems edited.</p>

<p>James Woods had<a href="http://theduran.com/actor-james-woods-sinks-hillary-clinton-exposes-earpiece-hillarys-left-ear-presidential-forum/"> previously exposed </a>her use of an earpiece on Twitter, but that WAS NOT at the Presidential Debate. &nbsp;Please notice the necklace. &nbsp;Apparently she just likes red pant suits.</p>

<p>Here's a profile shot from a few years back-</p>

<p>Here's your side by side.</p>

<p>What's it mean? &nbsp;Well the match looks very good to me. &nbsp;Could it be surgically altered? &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;Is there a non-zero chance, even if very small, she's a clone? &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;So, it's a data point. &nbsp;File it away, but you can for certain put it in the non-body double side for the debate.</p>
<p>After I asked you all for your thoughts on who showed up at the debate this is what came up so far.</p>

<p>For the clone theory diehards and those that want to check out the theory I'm posting this <a href="http://www.theeventchronicle.com/study/bilocation-hillary-clone-clinton/#">link</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a shot of a woman I believe is Double-2 (from Orlando event). &nbsp;You'll note she's careful about showing her ears. &nbsp;Here are <a href="http://www.gettyimages.com/search/stack/670126271/607835704?assettype=image&amp;excludenudity=true&amp;family=editorial&amp;sort=best&amp;phrase=#license">more images</a> from that day on Getty images.</p>
