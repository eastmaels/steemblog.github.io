So, I have a proposal, but I want to see what the community thinks of it.  Especially with the rise of the value of a SBD I'm in a new unique situation.  I can conceivably start paying people to come on my mspwaves broadcast with me. By bringing a celebrity onto my show I think I can generate enough funds and interest to make some real money.  By making real money I think I am in a position to bring some celebrities onto the show.  Normally this kind of thing is a catch 22, but the sudden spike in SBD price makes it so it's an actual possibility.

## The Good <h2>

Imagine if you start seeing celebrities joining Steem.  These people could be pop, sports, science, art, film, music, stars of any and all kinds.  Now imagine them holding up Steem signs, posting their rewards to their twitter followers and bringing droves of people to Steem.  Lastly, imagine them buying some Steem!

## The Bad <h2>

Imagine a horde of half brained twits joining the platform acting like they would on facebook and thinking they'll be heroes here.  I think it's gonna get a little unruly here as the noobs start to pour in.

## The Interesting <h2>

What if we can pull some really cool people to the platform!?!  Where can this take us?

## Bounties <h2>

When @meno brought @davidpakman on the Minnow Mayor Town Hall (my show that starts at 9pm EST on Sunday nights) I sent him $100 steem.  I'm not quite sure what I'm willing to pay for any given speaker, but for people that can make whales intersted enough to give rewards such that I can pay the guest and have some spare for a bounty I'm not opposed to dropping a hundo for a referrer.  So, let's see what you guys think about this plan.  Then let's see if any of you know some celebrities ... I'm really just looking for anyone with an audience over 100k people on basically any platform.  Then I'll pay them and pay you to help me bring them to Steem.

## Is this is a good idea?  Do you like it? <h2>
