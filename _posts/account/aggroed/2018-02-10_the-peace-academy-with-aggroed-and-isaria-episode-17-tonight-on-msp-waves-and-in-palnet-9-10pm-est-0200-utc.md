# The Peace Academy with @aggroed and @isaria

Time flies!  It’s hard to believe that we’re already up to Episode 17!  


The goal of the Peace Academy is to find ways to incorporate Peace, Abundance, and Liberty into our own lives and within our communities, and @isaria and I have been hard at work creating curriculum for this initiative every week since the show’s inception.

## Let’s take a look at some of the concepts we’ve discussed thus far:

* Palnet Motto: *Do no harm, but take no shit!*

* Self-care and inner peace

* Using compromise and guidelines to achieve peace

* Techniques for conflict resolution

* Personal boundaries

* Victim mentality

* Emotional Intelligence

* Assertiveness vs aggressiveness

* Energy and Shields

* Rules of Fair Fighting

* Passive-Aggressive behavior

* Healthy communication

* Scarcity mindset vs abundance mindset

* Government propaganda, corruption, and lies

* The Non-aggression principle

There’s much more to cover, but sometimes it’s good to have a review to solidify concepts already covered before moving forward.

  

Looking forward to seeing you all tonight!

As long as what you have to say is about Peace, Abundance, or Liberty it's fair game!
