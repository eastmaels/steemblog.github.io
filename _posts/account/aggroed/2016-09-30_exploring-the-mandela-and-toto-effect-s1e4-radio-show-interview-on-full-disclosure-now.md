Your reality isn't a static unchanging thing. &nbsp;Your past is very likely different than what you remember. &nbsp;The difference between what you remember and what actually happened is called the Mandela Effect. &nbsp;It's not controversial to say there is a difference, but it is highly controversial to explain what causes it.</p>
<p>I was able to join a radio show called "Looking Out From Within" with Justin Dechamps and Yvonne Palermo on a channel called "Full Disclosure now!"</p>
<p>You can hear the <a href="http://www.spreaker.com/user/fulldisclosurenow/mandela-effect-dr-blair-reich-justin-dec">radio show here</a>. &nbsp;Over the next little while I'm going to make a YouTube video out of this and add some images for people to check out.</p>

<p>It was an excellent show and an excellent experience, and a great introduction to the Mandela Effect for those that are interested. &nbsp;You can find more about <a href="www.grooviebean.com">Yvonne's radio station here</a> or <a href="http://sitsshow.blogspot.com/">Justin's Blog Stillness in the Storm here</a>.</p>
