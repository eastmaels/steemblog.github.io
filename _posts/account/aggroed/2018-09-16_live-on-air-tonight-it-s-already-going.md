The Minnow University Curation show and Peace Academy are now live.  Come visit us on msp-waves.  You can listen at mspwaves.com/listen and in the discord group PALnet.  The website is minnowpond.org.  That's just a handy link to the Discord room.

If you have posts and you think they should be curated then come into the chat and talk to us.  Give us your post.  We're happy to help it.

## Peace Academy


Tonight is also the Peace Academy.  Shane, Isaria and I will talk about finding balance in the world around us.  let's see how that goes.
