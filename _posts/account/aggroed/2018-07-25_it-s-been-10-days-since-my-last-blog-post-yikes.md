Man, time flies when you're feeling swamped.  As they said in Aeon Flux, that which does not kill us makes us stranger.  So, I ran up to vermont, got my shit together, came back, had some rough moments here and there.  I had a long conversation with my wife and Baby 1 about coming home from camp.  That was and is still a big deal to me.  Trying to move on.

I went down to NJ for a little bit.  I have a family reunion there every summer.  Was excited to see my family have a big birthday and anniversary celebration.  That was cool.  Spent some time talking to my family about block chains.  It's pretty important to me to get the word out there.  

I'm still waiting on some product changes, but before long I think we'll make it so that people can buy steemmonsters packs from other websites and keep a portion of the sales.  This can turn any website into a profitable business.  I'm looking forward to exploring this in the not too distant future.

Steem Monsters continues to take up a large percentage of my time.  The most recent thing is putting together a Kickstarter for it.  That should go live in the next couple of weeks or so.  I got most of the basic copy done in a first draft round.  Now it's time to make the video and really crank this stuff out.  I'm pretty sure it's going to be great visibility for the platform, for this project, and help give us some working capital to get fighting and future developments off the ground.

Minnow Support seems to be going ok.  I'm seeing a lot of the channels around the steem ecosystem are a little low population.  There's a few standouts where people still seem to be congregating, but between it being summer and low prices it would appear the steem ecosystem including Discord is feeling the lull.

I'm nearing 100k SP delegated out.  Nearly all of that is in parts of the minnow support project.  It's more than just @minnowsupport.  We have curation, a radio station, and try to support the active members too.  I think I'll take a delegation break after I hit 100k delegated and try to build up my @aggroed account some.  It's fun to have 15k active SP, but I'd like to be able to hit posts a little harder... so, time to save.

I hope you're enjoying watching the value of crypto coins out there start marching back up.  Here's hoping for new all time highs for crypto and Steem in the near future.  I think that's gonna drag some Steemians back into the mix too.  Should be fun!
