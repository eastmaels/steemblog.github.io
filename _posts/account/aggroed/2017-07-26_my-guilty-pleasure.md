OK, well I'm sorta addicted to this Steemit thing.  I fully admit that.  I run a support group for it called Minnow Support.  We meet everyday 24/7 on Discord to deal with our addiction to Steemit.    We have just shy of 4,000 minnows in there.  It's pretty awesome.  https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw

Anyway, I'm addicted to steemit tools too.  I check steemdb.com at least once an hour to see what's going on.  Mostly, I'm looking at votes and what not coming through, and I also like to see how my witness campaign is going.  I start with checking for new votes.

I like to check my total vote count.

and I like to see how I'm doing in terms of over all stake weighted votes for me.

## The glee <h2>

So, today was amazing because I moved into position 44.  Keeping my steady climb going, but that was a surprise to this post and off topic.  

What I really like and what I look for most...  I like the time periods where I don't get new votes, but the stake weight goes up.  I got a lot of minnows that I look after.  Many of them choose to vote for me.  So, when my total goes up but my vote count stays the same I'm watching the people that vote for me growing their account.

## A promise made is a debt unpaid <h2>

I haven't made many promises on here.  I hold pretty tight to values of peace, abundance, and liberty.  I promise to help growth hack steemit and retain minnows by creating a support network around them.  My one campaign promise beyond that was to be better than a dead witness.

Anyway, I like seeing that happen because it means I'm holding up my end of the bargain.  While it's only a sample of the minnows in "the pond" it's good enough for me to sleep easy.  And you can tell by the fact that the Minnowsupport discord is gonna hit 4k by this weekend that we're helping.  I'm honored to serve and gleeful to see the minnows growing.

Good times,
Witness 44,

Aggroed
