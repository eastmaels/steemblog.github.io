Dear Mr. Steemit author,  Please help us.  I have come into contact with an extremely wealthy Ethereum princess and she desparately needs your help.  Come be a savior like a white knight, hero, or even God to save this poor lady.  She was set upon by the cruelest of hackers.  They used a fake phishing site and were able to get her keys to her Binance account.  They have the password, but she has the 2FA, and they are currently deadlocked.

Inside of that account lives over 20,000 ETH.  She promises whatever soul helps her she will give 20% of her account value to save her.  The challenge is that first she must win back her password from Binance after hackers broke into her account.  So, please, help us.  The money she needs to pay the hackers for her account is locked up in her account.  She needs YOUR help.  The hackers are demanding 100ETH and threatening her.

## Hacker Message <h2>

`Send us 100ETH or you're never get your account back and we'll kill your pet dog's pet hampster!`

Simply send 100 ETH or however much you can manage to our princesses new account:

Once we receive it we will be able to send the hackers the money, release the princesses funds, and award you 2,000 ETH and the eternal gratitude of the lovely Ethereum Princess.

Won't you help us?  We need you!

## Watch for scams people <h2>
The real point of this is that we're still the wild west, but now we have to add some digital bullshit.  There's a lot of scammer's in the world.  it's best not to click on links and put in passwords and keys that can actually move money around.

You should be logging into steem with your private posting key, moving money with your active key, and not putting your master password into shit.  Be wary of steewit.com links.  That's phishing for your keys.  Careful logging into fake exchange sites too.

You best bet is to use bookmarks, and I feel pretty safe using steemplus by Stoodkev.  It has a steemconnect login that makes sure I'm on a real site.  If I'm not then it doesn't log me in and I know I'm someplace scammy.

If you're not sure then just type in steemit.com/@authorname and check their wall to get to a post you're trying to view.  You shouldn't go wrong typing in the right name.

## In case your exceptionally dense or english isn't your first language <h2>

Don't send Eth to the account that has in the account number "I have a large penis" written into it.  This story is fake news and meant to warn people not to participate in bullshit scams where people ask you for money upfront promising to pay you after you give them money first.
