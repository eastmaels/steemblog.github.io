This is an amazing piece of science and journalism that deeply investigates the favoritism that youtube provides to mainstream media.

Essentially the barrier to get on trending is substantially less if you're a traditional media company.

When people say they are getting silenced or their videos aren't being shown to the same extent here is literal evidence backed by numbers to show exactly that.

Youtube is part of the evil empire.  The fact that we can use it as a place to share our voice is important, but these fuckers hide your voice.  It's a mouthpiece for the powers that be that will allow you to post there, but actively hides your content.

If you ever wondered by you might need a blockchain based channel look no further...

I wonder if that will be relevant to anything else I'm working on???
