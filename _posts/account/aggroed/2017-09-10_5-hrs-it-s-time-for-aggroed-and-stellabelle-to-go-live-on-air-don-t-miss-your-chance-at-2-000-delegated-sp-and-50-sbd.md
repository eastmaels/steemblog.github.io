So, just had my first voice call with Stella as we approach show time as a bit of a prep for the show.  I've loved her writing for a while, but to really hear her first hand in thoughtful conversation I was blown away.  What a class act!  What a thoughtful lady!  She's awesomer than I even thought.  So, I'm completely thrilled (even more so than before) to have her on The Minnow Mayor Town Hall show.  It's going on live tonight in 5 hrs (9pm New York Time).

If you're wondering what we're gonna talk about... here's your hint: Tribes!

## Contests <h2>

3 Contests will happen on the show.

1.  1500 Delegated SP from a scavenger hunt I released earlier this week- https://steemit.com/mspwaves/@aggroed/stellabelle-to-star-on-the-minnow-mayor-town-hall-this-sunday-night-9-11-est-2-000-sp-delegation-contest-and-50-sbd-inside
2.  500 SP from an in show contest where the audience will recruit other listeners and for every person you recruit you get an extra "raffle ticket"
3.  Dice Bitches-  We'll roll some bones and the winner will get 25SBD (we'll do this twice on the second half of the show)

But you gotta be there if you want to win!!!  So, check out mspwaves.com/listen to hear the show and go to the PALnet Discord channel home of the Minnow Support Channel- https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy!


## Quick Side Note <h2>

The scavenger hunt for 1500 SP has a number of things you need to do for your shot at the 1500 SP.  These are purposefully designed to help and encourage you to do some of the things that separate dolphins from minnows.  So, the things on that list are things you already should know how to do, and if you don't now's the time to learn.  It's your Dolphin 101 homework with an MSP theme and a 1500 delegated SP potential as your reward.

## Should be fun! <h2>

See you there!
