# Conflict Resolution

Whether it is in our personal lives or within our communities, conflict is unfortunately inevitable.

One of my goals as a Witness and as the founder of the Minnow Support Project is to spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.

I started the Peace Academy as a way to facilitate this process and, along with @isaria, have been working on curriculum to help out the Steemit community.

Last week I posted a blog on [Conflict Resolution](https://steemit.com/peaceacademy/@aggroed/the-peace-academy-curriculum-conflict-resolution-part-1)
I included 5 great methods for resolving conflict and I'll be posting more methods in the future, but today I want to expand upon one of the most important methods that was mentioned in my last post.

## Stepping Away In Order To Cool Down <h2>



You can not have a productive and peaceful outcome when you are communicating while angry and raw.

No good can come from yelling, being condescending, insulting, or verbally attacking another person.

The individual on the receiving end of such behavior won't actually be hearing what you have to say due to the negative delivery.
They would likely just become defensive and continue to argue, perhaps in a similar fashion, which would take you further away from a peaceful resolution.

One should also consider the ramifications of communicating in such a manner in a public forum, like the internet.
No matter how justified you may feel in your anger, when you express it in the ways listed above, you usually come across as looking like the villain.
You may even be perceived as unstable or unhinged.


Anger can be a difficult emotion to control.
There is often an instinct to immediately react.
Most of us have had the experience of saying something we wish we wouldn't have said in a moment of anger.
Use that feeling as a reminder for future situations.

Being aware of your feelings is key and having a plan can help a great deal.

Plan on going into another room, going outside for a walk, or stepping away from the computer the next time you feel angry.

Stepping away in order to cool down is the first step to peacefully resolving conflict.
