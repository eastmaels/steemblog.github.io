<p>An unidentified woman in her late 60s was seen posthumously rising up from a comfortable apartment complex in the expensive section of the East side of Manhattan. &nbsp;Doctors ran out of the room screaming as the reanimated corpse rose, stumbled around the room, tried to chew their flesh from their bones, and then suggested continuing to push for regime change in Syria. &nbsp;Neighbors recall their horror as unsightly balls of green pus seemed to gush from her throat immediately creating reptillian offspring, and screamed as they were forced to listen to a series of flip-flipping opinions on gay marriage, free trade agreements, and her position as a moderate/progressive. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Police arrived at the scene in an attempt to corral the beast, but ultimately couldn't take the anti-trump rhetoric and retreated in a cowardly fashion to a safer part of town where they could more easily kill unarmed citizens for non-violent statue violations. &nbsp;While most citizens were horrified at nearly everything the monster said and did some citizens seemed to succumb to the illness via an airborne sonic infection that induced similar tendencies in them. &nbsp;For now it seems the majority of cases of infection remain with CNN and MSNBC watching middle aged women. &nbsp;Doctors believe that traditional media outlets may be a catalyst for spreading the disease.</p>
