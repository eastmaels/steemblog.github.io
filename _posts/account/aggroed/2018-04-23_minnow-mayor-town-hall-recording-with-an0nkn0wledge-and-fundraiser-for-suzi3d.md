Had a really fantastic show last night with @an0nkn0wledge!  Dude is on point!  While recording we kicked off a fundraiser for @suzi3d!  Suzie is a New Zealand mother who is living in legal limbo in Russia after fleeing the country.  She's currently running for elected office in New Zealand and works with Kim Dotcom's Internet Party.  She's doing that while having fled from her own country for her safety and that of her family.

Being in legal limbo in a country that doesn't speak her langauge makes acquiring work challenging.  So, I'm kicking off a fund raiser to help her.  She's been on the Minnow Mayor Town Hall before.  She's intelligent, kind hearted, and a giant advocate for Steem.  She's brought numerous independant journalists to the site and runs a Discord server of them so they can coordinate activities and share personal triumphs with one another.

This isn't just a call for a handout.  This is a bad ass Steemian in need of some financial help who absolutely brings value to the platform!  I'm hearing reports that the situation is pretty dire, and people that work hard for the block shouldn't be left in that situation!

So, I sent 100 SBD.  @ausbitbank sent 100 steem.  @globocop sent 10 sbd.  MSP has already kicked off a fund raiser for her.  ALL post rewards from this post will go to her in addition to the SBD I sent.  Please feel free to add your own donation and for those donations I'll be happy to get you a resteem from @aggroed or @minnowsupport.

Please Help @suzi3d by donating to her directly!

## Show Recording

The show itself was pretty fun.  @an0nkn0wledge is a wealth of information and a dedicated indepenant journalist.  It's a fun conversation as he's looking through official docs looking for evidence of crime and I tend to go to first hand accounts and second hand discussions.

This conversation is all over the place, but roughly looks into differents perspectives of how the Deep State is operating, what they are doing, what's getting exposed now and why, and a general state of the underground war that seems to be playing out in front of us.  That part of the interview starts at roughly the 1hr mark.
