Cheers guys!  @eurogee and @smyle really seemed to motivate their community.  I hadn't heard of euronation before, but now it's on my radar.  These two received a ton of votes together.  So, rather than hand out one delegation for 500 I'm going to delegate to each of them 250 SP.  Congratulations guys!

## Next contest <h2>

Over the next two days I'll delegate 500 SP to one of the moderators.  So, go ahead and put some votes together for moderator!  Same rules as before.  You can name up to two people.  These folks don't have to be minnows to win.  Also, I'll be rotating delegation to moderators frequently, so as long as I'm a top witness there will opportunities every week to reward the moderators.  Hopefully everyone gets a few turns to win delegation.  Here are the folks that are eligible.

## Interest rate <h2>

Sorry to put this a little buried in a contest post, but I want to have a limited discussion on price feed options with the SBD getting a little hammered.

I want to protect the SBD price, but I'm also nervous that the primary beneficiary of that would be poloniex...   Folks have tickets out for months and can't get their steem or sbds back.  I'm not dying to add interest to help this way, but I'm somewhat amendable.  I just want to start the discussion at least to see what people that voted for me think on the issue.  

I'm sorting steemwhales by sbd in the image below.

So, regarding prices.... I think we're going through trouble because the main exchanges are having difficulty.  The value of Steem and SBDs are going to be depressed if people can't easily exchange it for other currencies.  

In the short run we can leave it alone and hope they come back online for steemit soon, increase the interest rate, which drastically benefits poloniex and bittrex, but likely won't provide much benefit to average holders in the short run, and we can change the bias effectively making it more attractive to convert SBDs to steem.  Those are the short term options.

Longer term options we can build and house an exchange.  I'd like to spearhead a group to do this.  I'm aware it's a big challenge to solve, but if you have skills, thoughts, or would like to think this through let me know.

What do you want to see happen to move the price of steem and sbds up?
