@scaredycatguide is a well known Steemer in the PALnet circles.  He hosts his own radio show.  He's a business guy that posts about making money, handling real estate transactions, and growing said business.  I've really only touched on him in a few of my others.  This one is mostly directed at him.  He was just talking about loading his lyrical gun up with full clips.  It inspired this.

## Zeus <h2>

You kids and your violence but we’re now at days end
put those toys down no more time for pretend
Hera just finished making some dinner.  Play time is over my kiddie gun slinger.
She made us some plates of salad and surf, put down yo' plastic you know that it’s Nerf.

You talk about money, loot, and fat change, but I’m shooting off lightning when I make it rain.
You’re proud of yo Benz, tank of gas and yo tire, come see my whip it’s always on fire.
You wants to be big? That’s your desire? I’ll let you be king; all man’s my empire.

It’s time that I go hard and really let loose, you thought I was Aggroed but really I’m Zeus!
I know you’re proud thinkin’ youre fly, but that isn’t shit to the god of the sky!

I’m making my case with Lightning and thunder.  You challenged a God I think that’s a blunder.
So I’m teaching you gents, furries and ladies, don’t heed my lesson I’ll send you to Hades
Sorry I’m cranky Cere’s got fleas, I’ll make it a chore for my son  Hercules.
Sit down, eat, and quit silly rappin.  Then go to sleep; Hera's ass I'll be tappin’

Not bad since I made it while sitting in traffic.
