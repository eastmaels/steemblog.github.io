Here's an image of lives destroyed by Gardasil.  These women and girls are a mix of paralyzed , injured, or dead.  3rd Party Gardasil safety evaluations haven't been completed.  Thousands of people have reported injuries after vaccination.  The stories are heart breaking.

As a consequence of so many injuries and trials going very poorly in Japan their health ministry stopped supporting people getting this vaccine in Japan.

Here's a testimonial you may want to listen to.
