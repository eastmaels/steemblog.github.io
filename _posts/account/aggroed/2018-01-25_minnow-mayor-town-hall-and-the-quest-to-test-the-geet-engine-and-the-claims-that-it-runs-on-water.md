This was a pretty crazy Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  The big story out of this is that I had a chance to speak with David Pantone who is the son of Paul Pantone.  Paul was the creator of the GEET engine.  They make the claim that you can take a generator from Harbor Freight Tools and use parts from Home Debot worth roughly a few hundred and convert the traditional engine into a GEET engine.  The advantage of the GEET is that the engine is able to run on a mixture of gasoline and water.  

This seems pretty impossible to many people.  I remain skeptical, but I saw this operating once a few months back in Maine when I met Jeremy up there.  So, I'm thinking it's worth exploring.  I'm a PhD chemist, but I'm not an electrician or a mechanic.  I'm open to the chance I'm getting duped here, but also cautious.  So, I'm bringing @r0nd0n up with me who is an electrician to lay a second set of eyes on this thing.  I'm also bringing a camcorder and we'll film it with a skeptics eye.

Step 1.  Look at it with R0n on Sunday (includes filming and posting)
Step 2.  Test it out with a small unit on an RV
Step 3.  Figure out if we believe it
Step 4.  Upgrade wiring in my house (has to happen anyway)
Step 5.  Buy a Harbor Freight Tools generator 
Step 6.  Have them tweak it
Step 7.  Hook it up

We start off Part 2 with David Pantone and Jeremy (Remy).  We talk about David's father's invention of the GEET engine.  It's an engine that can run on a water/gasoline mix.  I've seen it personally running on a water/gas mix.  We have a good
