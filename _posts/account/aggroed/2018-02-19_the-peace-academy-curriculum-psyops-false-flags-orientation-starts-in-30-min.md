# What is a False Flag?

Also known as Engineered Events, a False Flag is just one of many psychological operation methodologies (PSYOP).  Many of these have been perpetrated by private corporations and governments around the world and many have been publicly disclosed as such.

# A Few Proven False Flags Throughout History

* **The Manchurian Incident**
In 1931, The Japanese army caused an explosion on a train and blamed it on China in order to rationalize and gain support for the invasion of Manchuria.


* **Nuremberg trials**
High ranking SS officers admitted to burning the German Parliament building and blaming it on Communists. They also admitted to attacking their own citizens and blaming the Polish in order to justify the invasion of Poland.



* **Operation Northwoods**
United States declassified documents from 1962 show that the Joint Chiefs of Staff formulated a plan to hijack American planes, blow up U.S. ships, and commit terrorist acts in America while blaming Cuba in order to justify an invasion.
[ABC news report](http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92662&page=1 "ABC news report"); [the official documents](http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20010430/northwoods.pdf "the official documents") 





* **Secret Cold War in Italy**
With help from the Pentagon and the CIA, NATO implemented terrorist attacks from 1950 through 1980 in Italy and other European countries.
They blamed the Communists in order to gain support for the continued fight against Communism.

**Direct quote from a participant involved in this Secret Cold War:**
[“You had to attack civilians, people, women, children, innocent people, unknown people far removed from any political game. The reason was quite simple. They were supposed to force these people, the Italian public, to turn to the state to ask for greater security”](http://web.archive.org/web/20051130003012/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/synopsis.htm "“You had to attack civilians, people, women, children, innocent people, unknown people far removed from any political game. The reason was quite simple. They were supposed to force these people, the Italian public, to turn to the state to ask for greater security”") … [so that “a state of emergency could be declared, so people would willingly trade part of their freedom for the security. This is the political logic that lies behind all the massacres and the bombings which remain unpunished, because the State cannot convict itself or declare itself responsible for what happened.”](https://video.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search;_ylt=AwrTca_5q89UIAwAVlsnnIlQ;_ylu=X3oDMTB0MzkwOG5yBHNlYwNzYwRjb2xvA2dxMQR2dGlkA1lIUzAwNF8x?p=bbc+gladio&hspart=mozilla&hsimp=yhs-001 "so that “a state of emergency could be declared, so people would willingly trade part of their freedom for the security”")


## NDAA 2012  and the repeal of the Smith-Mundt Act <h2>

Prior to 2012 it was illegal for the government to create psyops in America to effect Americans.  The law forbidding this was called the Smith-Mundt Act.  The National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 repealed the Smith-Mundt act thus allowing the government and private corporations to create false narratives to deceive Americans.  These tactics are largely used to foster war and violence, which generally speaking, average people don't support.

Here's an [article about the repeal in the NDAA](http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5).
