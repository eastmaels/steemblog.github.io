Congrats to everyone that participated in the first round of STEEMFEST MINNOW.  I saw several $100 posts in the crowd.  Lots to be proud of there.  We're on to the next round.

## For this Round Please Prepare a Second and Final Post <h2>

You're trying to go to Steemfest.  Please make a post and describe the following and link that post in the comments-

A certain Challenge you feel needs to be addressed in the world
A vision statement of what a better alternative would look like
A Mission Statement 
A specific set of Goals you have while attending Steemfest
How you plan to to achieve your goals and your mission
Please provide a simple chart of your refined budget

Posts are due Thursday July 6th.

The posts will be combined into a separate post and followers can mention their favorite post in the comments section.  The winner should be announced within 1-2 weeks.

## Judges <h2>

Judges will be asked to provide their sense of your overall plan on a scale of 1-10.  The totals will be tallied and the highest tally of the judges will be awarded the all expense trip.

You should think of this as an investment the community is making in you.  How will we achieve the highest return on our investment?  What will you bring, create, achieve, that others couldn't and why is that good for the platform?  What value will you add to this community?
