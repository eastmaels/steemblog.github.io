@theywillkillyou BOOYA 1M subscribers, @davidpakman KAPOW 400k subscriber, @brianturner BOOM 200k subscribers.  On top of that we had a fantastic audience and rounded out the show with our very own homegrown stars from PALnet, the Minnow Support Project, and even some visitors from neighboring groups!

I'm really excited to bring you this show because we're trying to talk through what it's going to take for us as a community to be able to bring YouTube content providers here and start getting a glance of what is needed on and off the block to make this transition happen.

We also have a tentative date set right now for January 13th for a 5M YouTube subscriber panel discussion.  The plan is to get YouTube Personalities and Steem folks together to build a community of YouTubers on the block to help ease the transition by having a community to work with.  I'm excited to see where we can take this!
