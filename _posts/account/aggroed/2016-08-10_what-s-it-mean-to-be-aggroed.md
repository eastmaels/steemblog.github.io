<p>My handle is Aggroed.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I'm an activist.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I wasn't born this way.  I lived a nice quiet life, in a nice quiet town, with a nice quiet family, going to nice private schools.  I should love the system.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I don't love the system.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I woke up and realized that government is broken, money is broken, religion is broken, and my viewpoints regarding all of it was broken.<br />
</p>
<p>In World of Warcraft you can choose an avatar and that avatar wanders around.  If you move to close to a monster that would otherwise not bother you then you have aggroed it.  It means you have taken it out of it's peaceful existence and as it awakes it attacks you.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I was passively asleep obeying the system until it woke me up.  Now I've been aggroed.  Now I'm Aggroed.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
