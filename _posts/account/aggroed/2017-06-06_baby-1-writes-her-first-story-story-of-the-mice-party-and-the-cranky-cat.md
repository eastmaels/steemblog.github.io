The following is brought to you by my first-one daughter.  She's under 10 and older than 5.  She wants the handle dreesa, but I'm not ready to give a little one her own profile.  This place is awesome, but the internet has a lot of creeps.  Ok, so with that backdrop I give you her first story.

The cat was standing by the river and saw a mouse jump over. 
The cat then tried to jump across, but then fell in, and he got wet and cranky.
Then the cat saw on the other side tons and tons of mice.

They were having a party to celebrate the escape of their friend from the naughty kitty!  And the cat got to shore and tried to get back to the partying mice by jumping over the river, but kept falling in over and over.
