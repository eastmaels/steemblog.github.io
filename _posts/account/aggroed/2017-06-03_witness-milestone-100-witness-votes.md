Woah, I'm so incredibly grateful!  This is really amazing.  I've been at this for 3 days and I have 100 votes already!  To put that in perspective @roelandp, creator of STEEMFEST, has in the 700s, and has been at this in a high publicity way for a while.  100 in 3 days is a phenomenal start and I'm thrilled, honored, and humbled.  I'm very grateful to the community of supporters that I have.  I'm doing my best to help this place grow, stay kind-hearted, and project positive change into the world.

## The witness itself <h2>

Currently I'm ranked 62 on the witness list.

You can see there are 6 dead witness accounts ahead of mine.  I'm not a programmer so I realize I may never make it to the top spots, and maybe that's ok.  Though I think I can do a lot to spread a healthy culture and grow this place.  It doesn't really matter what position I'm in when I'm working with minnows that are trying to grow.  They just want exposure and some basics about how this place works.  Witness rank won't really matter.

Even in position 62 I'm witnessing blocks.  My server is literally helping to construct the blockchain.  It makes you feel differently about this place.  Kinda like a "Hey, I helped make that."  I know I was doing it before with my posts, but this is different.

Here's a snapshot of the accounts that are supporting me.  There are some epic names in that list.  Again, I feel very honored to have their support, and I hope my work will show I was worthy of the vote in the first place!

## Now that the first intro phase is done it's time to get to work <h2>

Two quick projects I'm thinking about adding.
1.  Witness badges-  Badges are social proof, add character, and in this case can bring attention to behind the scenes  of how this place runs.  I'm not sure many people know what a Witness is, and frankly I'm not sure there's an exact definition.  Technically it's just a server, but in reality they are part ambassador, tech support, programmer, growth hacker, and social glue.  I'm not an artist, but I'm good with fivrr and freelancer and I'll see what I can pull together!

2. Education- I'm employed in higher education tech sales.  I can put together a high level demo of this place pretty easily.  So, I think that's one of my next projects.  Maybe I'll make a screencast about it... but mostly I want to try to get in front of college students.  I was thinking journalism, english, computer science, finance, and economics would be good places to start conversations.  I want to give a live or webex pitch that talks about steemit, what it is, why it exists, and why they should be involved.  Imagine catching the next generation of thought leaders like that... I live in New England.  Lots of great schools around here could be seeding grounds for Steemit.

## I just want to express my gratitude <h2>
I get some pretty amazing comments.  Folks will share how much it means to them that I'm helping them.  Winning contests, getting resteems, and just knowing that I'm reading their posts even when they are little accounts makes a big difference to a minnow.  It feels awesome to be able to help others out like that.  

Witness votes are stake weighted.  That means if you're a whale the vote is worth more.  That's true in the vote weight tally, but I take each one of these votes pretty seriously.  On the other end is someone working on this platform to share their views, show some art, and grow a community.  I'm thrilled to have gotten your support; whale, dolphin, or minnow.
