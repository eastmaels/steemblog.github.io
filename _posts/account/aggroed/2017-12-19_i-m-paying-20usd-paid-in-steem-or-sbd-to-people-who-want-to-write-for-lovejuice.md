Lovejuice started as a weird joke to me.  I was mad at how much circle jerking was going on and I was going to build a bot that would flag posts and spray some lovejuice on it and tell people that lovejuice is best shared between at least two consenting adults.  That didn't happen and so I had this account lying around.  After HF19 bid bots came out and you could purchase super large votes, but finding the smaller less well used ones was hard.  So, I fired up a linux box, installed Dr. Otto by @inertia, and turned lovejuice into a bid bot.  She/he/it/furryx has been running on 5k, then 10k, then 15k SP.  It's putting around 20USD on a post when it's fully bought (going up with the newest spike).

It's pulling in about 6-10/day SBD right now, and that's a fair amount of money.  I don't just want to take from the community I want to give back (one way you can see that is through my delegations).  So, somewhere along the way I decided to post some weird erotic stories on there to go with the erotic theme of the name lovejuice.  I'm not much of a sexy time writer so I started asking a few people to write some content on there and I would pay them for that.  It started at 5sbd, but then that went crazy, so we switched to 5usd, and then 5 steem.  Now, I'm pretty happy to pay 20USD worth of steem or sbd for a story.

## The content <h2>

Lovejuice started with erotic content, but meh, I'm happy to accept just about anything.  This is geared towards helping minnows who are just starting with no steem and no followers to try to build some equity on the platform.  So, I care a little less about the content and more about supporting new users on here.  So, don't shitpost, but write about whatever you want, do art, make stories, showcase talents, and make this kinda like a variety mag.

## Logistics <h2>

@isaria runs the day to day.  So, find her in the PALnet discord channel and message her (you can find the link on the @minnowsupport wall).  Give her the text and a link to an image and if it's accepted she'll post it on Lovejuice and when payout happens we'll send you 20USD worth of Steem.  For now we're looking for roughly 1 a day.  We'll see how reception to this goes.

## Marketing your posts <h2>

So, I'm gonna market the posts that you make on there too.  How will I do that you ask?  Bid Bots!  As coowner of steembottracker.com and helping to manage a series of bots on Steem I am a believer in these as a tool to help promote people and as a potential revenue model.  So, how does it work.  You send us the original text of a new post (typically delivered on a hackmd.io markdown page), we post it, and I'll nuke it with some bid bot rewards to try to get some eyes on it.

The author gets exposure, I have a sustainable revenue model, shit posters have more competition, and we have a sustainable economic model to promote minnow content with heavy votes that hopefully break even  and maybe catch a few extra votes or would be pre-runner curators.  Hopefully getting put on the page will get you more followers and friends as you'll get an immediate viewership of 1400 from @lovejuice and then here's hoping the bid bots collect more eyes too.

It's meant to be fun and helpful to new members in the community.  Hopefully this all goes well.
