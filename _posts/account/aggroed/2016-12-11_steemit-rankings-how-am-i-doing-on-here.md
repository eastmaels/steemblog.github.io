<p>Sometimes it's nice to see how I'm stacking up against other users in the community. &nbsp;So, you can vanity steem yourself on steemwhales.com and see how you're doing. &nbsp;This is what I'm rocking today. &nbsp;I'm about $150 or so away from being in the top 1k accounts. &nbsp;That's sorta cool. &nbsp;I think the one I like the most is how I have one of the highest reputations int he steemit community. &nbsp;Unfortunately it's worth practically next to nothing since the whales don't like to upvote my content. &nbsp;Unclear if it's because I'm an asshat who has at times poked fun at the founders or because they don't want to read about Clinton crimes and Pizzagate (or future Trump crimes I'll report on).</p>
