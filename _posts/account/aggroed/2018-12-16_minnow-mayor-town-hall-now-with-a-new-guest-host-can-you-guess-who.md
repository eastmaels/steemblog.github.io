Ladie, gentlemen, furries, and post-gender millenials.  I am happy to report a change to the Minnow Mayor Town Hall format for the show going forward.  I'm excited to announce a new co-host:  @llfarms!

The show starts at 8pm EST 0100 UTC.  You're all welcome to hop into PALnet to join the conversation.  This is a chance to talk about what's happening on the platform, what people are working on, introduce yourself, introduce a project, or just get to know your fellow Steemians.

If you have a Dapp you'd like to talk about that would be great.  Otherwise we'll just chill, talk, and listen to tunes.

Can't wait to see you tonight at 8pm est at minnowpond.org and please give a warm welcome to Justine aka @llfarms
