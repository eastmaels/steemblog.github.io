<p>So, I have 7 GPUs. &nbsp;1 is a Radeon Sapphire Nitro Radeon 460 (4GDDR5). &nbsp;One is a MSI Radeon 480 (4GDDR5). &nbsp;I have 5 XFX Radeon 470 (4GDDR5).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I bought a 460, 470, and 480 to test out which card made the most sense financially.</p>
<p>I'm running <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1670733.0">Claymore's </a>AMD ZEC miner 8. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my config file-</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>-zpool stratum+tcp://equihash.usa.nicehash.com:3357</p>
<p>-zwal 12r76wXi9jznKFGKP8tTDyGqXqT66gwJaL</p>
<p>-zpsw (wouldn't you like to know)</p>
<p>-allpools 1</p>
<p>-i 6</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As you can see, I'm using NiceHash. &nbsp;It's paying me in bitcoin, which I'm currently converting to Steem. &nbsp;I'll start a full 24 hour cycle at 6pm tonight. &nbsp;So, I'll use that as a guage to figure out how much it's actually making. &nbsp;NiceHash flucuates all over the effing place so it's really hard to guage.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So, my 460 drew 45-95 watts of power and pulled in 83 H/S.</p>
<p>My 470 drew 120 watts of power and pulled in 175 H/S.</p>
<p>My 480 drew 150 watts of power and pulled in 190 H/S.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The 460 has literally half the computational cores of the 470 and 480. &nbsp;Also, @cryptos told me the 470 would be much stronger if I switched to a different coin to mine. &nbsp;So, I went with the 470s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;After I have a profit baseline I'll start messing around with other mining approaches. &nbsp;When the Hardfork comes on Dec 6 and we switch over to equihash I might actually trying mining Steem and skip the whole Nicehash thing. &nbsp;We'll see. &nbsp;I make between $8-12/day on Nicehash and spend about $5.50 on electricity. &nbsp;So, squeezing more profit out seems important.</p>
<p>I should also note that I've overclocked my GPUs some. &nbsp;I'm using Sapphire Trixx to do it. &nbsp;So, if you put stock cards in and don't quite get those numbers that's why.</p>
