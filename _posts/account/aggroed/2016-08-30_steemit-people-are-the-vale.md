<p>What is the real value of STEEM Dollars or any Fiat currency? &nbsp;The value in the system are the number of people that utilize the system followed by the amount of goods and services provided by the people in the system. &nbsp;You can track the value through dollars and currency conversions but at the heart of this is people. &nbsp;While the mining and generating of currency in this model is cool and all the real value driver should be attracting new people to STEEMIT.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Here's my suggestion. &nbsp;If someone isn't logged in when they look at an article there should be a button at the top of the article that says join STEEMIT. &nbsp;Anytime someone joins STEEMIT because of the article they were reading or landed on the system should release SD to the author of the article. &nbsp;The highest value thing you can do within STEEM is to make a great post that everyone likes up and upvotes, but the highest value thing that we can do is attract more people here and there isn't enough incentive to do that right now.</p>
