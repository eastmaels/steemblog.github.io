It's my pleasure to provide another deep dive into the Peace Academy.  This evenings show was a little bit special as we go in the "Woo" side of the world.  It starts off by talking about some of the playing around that Aggroed did with the Deep Dream Generator.

You can find that post [here](https://steemit.com/nude/@lovejuice/aggroed-explores-the-deep-dream-generator-an-artisticly-experienced-partial-nude-art-expose-art-boobs-here).  It's not completely safe for work, so just a little heads up there.

## Mental Projection and Remote Viewing <h2>

Ok, next up we take a walk through some CIA/Military inspired remote viewing.  This article was again on steemit.com by Rolling Stones author Neil Strauss.  You can find that article [here](https://steemit.com/life/@neilstrauss/i-was-a-psychic-spy-for-the-cia-and-i-found-god-a-true-story)

The crazy thing about remote viewing is that once you know you can extend your essence outside of your own meatsack you are made experimentally and experientially aware of how you're a soul having a meat sack experience and not the other way around.

This was one of my most favorite shows I've done and I hope you enjoy it!
