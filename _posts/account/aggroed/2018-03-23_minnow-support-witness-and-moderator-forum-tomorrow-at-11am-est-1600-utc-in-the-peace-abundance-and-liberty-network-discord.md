Alright!  Well, part of being back in the saddle is going back to community building.  Tangibly what that means is getting people into the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord group, which is now over 16,000 Steemians, and organizing them into the same place and time to help get to know one another.

## The Conversation

This week we're going to be interviewing members of the Minnow Support Project.  We'll talk to witnesses and moderators about their experience managing the largest Steem based social group that exists.  We've been around for less than a year and we've gotten up to over 100k SP organically and through delegations as well as 16,000 people.  Let's talk about the goals of the group and people that lead it.

This is a good chance to ask questions and ask some folks how they make decisions as we steer this communal space.  You know it will be an excellent conversation because it's going to be cohosted with none other than the extraordinary @kubbyelizabeth!

## Logistics

Come join us in [the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Group](minnowpond.org).  There are voice channels on the left.  You'll see many people hanging out in them.

The show is tomorrow at 11am EST which is 1600 UTC.  It'll run for about 2 hours.

If you have questions bring them, otherwise we'll just gab about life in the Pond, why the mission is important to us, what we do, and how we help steem grow and support new members.

## Account Voting

As an aside to show you how we help the community I'm including a picture of the @minnowsupport account voting report from steemreport.com for the last two weeks.

This actually shows that we're tossing votes to some 6,000 accounts over the last two weeks.  Individually we make 2,000-4,000 votes per day.  You'll notice that @minnowsupport doesn't self vote at all either.

## Community Building is my witness project

If you think it's valuable to bring people together and foster community on the platform please support my witness and the witnesses listed above with your votes.  The Minnow Support Project is a labor of love that takes many hours a week to run and manage by a team of dedicated people.  While everyone has a distinct set of personal goals I think we are collectively driven by a desire to see the world change for the better, a desire to help other people, a willingness to work, and a love of Steem and the people that make up this place.  If you find value in what we're doing and think having a 16,000 Steemian Discord community is a positive development for the ecosystem as a whole please consider voting for the witnesses that are part of this project, advise it, or delegate to it.
