It's a busy 2nd Saturday of the month.  I have 3 radio shows that I'll be doing across today and tomorrow.

First up is Sounds of Steem-  This is a live music performance by some extremely talented artists.  Come check it out.  Starts in 2 hours with me spinning some tunes from the 90s and then moves into 2 hours of Steemian creation and aural delight!

Next up is Peace Academy.  I'm looking forward to working with Shane and Isaria as we explore peaceful interaction with other people, have some good laughs, and tell some personal stories and try to put decisions and personality into context.  Steemit is the broken hearts club.  Lots of folks have a story to tell, maybe you'll want to share yours.  The 3 hour radio block starts at 9pm est as we'll have a 1hr broadcast of Minnow University Curation where we love up on some minnow posts, and then the Peace Academy begins at 10pm est.

Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  This is going to be a pretty neat show.  We have the creators of Hash Rush coming on.  They'll be describing a blockchain based real time strategy game.  I'm looking forward to hearing about it, especially as I'm planning on eventually having one built for Steem Monsters.  So, I can't wait to hear what struggles they have gone through, lessons they have learned, and I can try to figure out if they'd like to make a Steem based version for the block.
