This is a screen play depicting a conversation held between characters of different generations as they attempt to play Guess Who (by Milton Bradley) and the shenanigans that arise as a result.

Setting- The following takes place in Pat's living room.  It's a relatively small condo in a somewhat urban setting though not directly in the city.  There are two couches at 90 degree angles to each other and an Ikea table  (might I suggest the [Rissna or Rekarne](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/departments/living_room/10705/))

The room looks something like this-

Characters-

Pat-  We never get a clear image of Pat.  It's unclear if Pat is a chromosomal man or woman and little indication is given throughout the screen play to indicate their preferred pronoun thus clarifying their publicly displayed preference for masculine or feminine appearance.  Pat was born somewhere between 1976 and 1984 placing them in the fuzzy zone of Gen X and Millennial.

Kristie-  Is a early 20s Millennial and younger sister to Pat presumably living in the same house or simply visiting.  Kristie has some visible stereotypes often put on people labelled as Social Justice Warrior.  She dresses a little on the side of masculine and has short hair that's dyed.  She's a nice girl, but with a little sass/bite.  She's the product of a modern family and shows some biracial features.

Mike- Mike is in his mid thirties.  He's a well groomed Caucasian lumberjack looking fellow who wouldn't have a clue how to use an ax or saw.


Scene- Kristie is on the couch when the door bell rings.
There is a moment where running water from the shower somewhere else in the apartment is heard.
Kristie- I GOT IT!!!
Kristie opens the door and greets Mike warmly.

Kristie- Hey Mike.  Welcome.  Come on in.  Pat's still in the shower so it's gonna be a bit.  My guess is it'll take about as long as it takes you to perfectly manscape that sweet beard of yours.

Mike- Thanks Kristie it's good to see you too.

Kristie- Actually, I'm going with Krystal these days.  I think it sounds more adult.

Mike- Ok, well, thanks for letting me in.  I suppose I'll just take a seat.

Krystal- Do you want any food?  It's going to be a second before we can get to the restaurant.

Mike- No thanks's Krystal.  That's very kind of you to offer this time.  I appreciate it.

Krystal-  Well, Pat seems to like you so I suppose it's time to roll out the red carpet.

Mike- Hey, is that Guess Who?  I haven't played that since I was a kid!

Krystal picks up the MB game from a lower shelf in the coffee table.

Krystal- Yeah, my niece is turning 5 and I found this in Buttons and Butterflys.  The consignment store over on mainstreet.  I think it has everyone still.

Mike- Well, fun!  We have a second do you wanna play?

Krystal- Sure.  Ok.

Mike- Why don't you pick the person and I'll "Guess Who!?!"

Krystal opens up the package and picks a frumpy old woman wearing a hat and earrings.

Krystal- Ok.  I'm ready.

Mike- Is it a man or a woman?

Krystal- Well, genetically or gender?

Mike- What?  What's the difference?

Krystal- Really?  I have to explain this?  You're 35.

Mike- Well, back when I was growing up we only had men and woman.

Krystal- That's beyond inaccurate.  People have been expressing themselves in different ways for eons.  The media just portrayed two stereotypes.  Anyways, genetics is about chromosomes and genitals.  Do you have XX and lady parts or XY and man parts.  Gender is more about how you express yourself publicly as either masculine or feminine.  Frankly, it's not really polite to ask these days anymore.  If you walk up to a gender fluid person and ask if they are a boy or girl you might as well be asking "Do you have a penis?" and that's rude.

Mike- Woah.  Um, ok.  Well, we didn't have that rule in place when I was growing up.  I didn't mean to offend anyone.  Let's try another simple one.  I take it back.  Is this person wearing glasses?

Krystal- Mike, really?  I don't think the person I chose wants to be identified by their ocular precision and wouldn't want that for their friends either.  That's rude too.  For some eyesight is so bad that's is a true disability and trying to categorize people based on their disabilities is something that I'm just not ok with.  I thought I already told you the experience I had growing up with a minor learning disability.  You can't imagine what that's been like.

Mike- Yikes.  Wow.  Ok, well, I meant that as a pretty basic description.  I wasn't trying to label your person or any of their associaties as ocullarly disabled.  Umm, why don't you pick a question that's feels more suitable and I'll see if I can answer it.

Krstal- Sure, well there are lots that are still acceptable.  Why don't we do an easy one like are they wearing a hat or what color is their shirt?

Mike- What was that last one?

Krystal- What color is their shirt.

Mike snickers.

Krystal- What?

Mike- I'm color blind.  Remember?  Or maybe I should say visble spectrum diminished.  I mean how's a guy like me supposed to play a game like this when you're focusing on color and picking on my disability.  I mean 1 in 4 men have to live this way.  I should wear a colorless eyeball on my shirt to raise awareness.

Krystal is genuinely embarrassed.
Krystal- Wow, I'm soo sorry.  That was horrible that I forgot.  Yeah.  I shoulda just went with the hat thing.  I'm really sorry.  I want this to be a safe space for you.

Mike- It's ok.  I didn't have those either when I was a kid.  Let's just put this away for now and hopefully Pat's ready soon.

Krystal- Are you sure?  I can make it up to you?

Mike- Honestly, it's no biggie.  Besides I think the shower just stopped and then we're off.  Hopefully there will be some home schooled, fair trade, organic certified, free range, cage free, gluton free, soy free, trans fat free, USDA approved chicken substitute that we can all enjoy.
