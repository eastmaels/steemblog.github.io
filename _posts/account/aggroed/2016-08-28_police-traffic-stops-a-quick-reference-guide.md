<p>I've "beaten" an immigration checkpoint crossing and gotten thrown in the slammer by Canada Border Patrol. Let's have a chat about how to handle this and how not to. &nbsp;I'm not going to go deep in the Rabbit Hole in this case, but I assure you it's much weirder than what I'm about to share.</p>
<p>The Anti-Media put out a great <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/deputy-tells-avoid-roadside-rights-violations-transportation-stop-script/">story </a>about a cop who takes the time to instruct people on how to engage with cops during traffic stops. &nbsp;There is a step by step <a href="https://www.fraudstoppers.org/wp-content/uploads/Transportation-Stop-Action-Script.pdf">guide </a>to the conversation that he wrote. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a video of a driver very professionally flexing his rights to not be targeted by police without evidence of a crime or suspicion of a crime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph-i9Uw73z0</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First thing to know about police interaction is avoid it at all cost.</p>
<p>Second thing to know is that as soon as you are forced to engage police begin filming.</p>
<p>Third, the rights they teach you in school are bullshit. &nbsp;They are now <a href="http://thingsthatsuck.info/us-schools-to-teach-children-how-to-obey-cops/">starting classes</a> in how to obey police authority. &nbsp;Don't trust what you have learned to be accurate. &nbsp;You're going to have to do some digging down some rabbit holes to start figuring out what your actual rights are and you will find some things vary state to state.</p>
<p>When you are forced to have an encounter here's how you start (I'm not an attorney. &nbsp;This does not constitute legal advice. &nbsp;This is what I've done and read and it works for me. &nbsp;So, imagine I'm saying this to an empty internet chat room you may have stumbled into.)</p>
<p>Step 0. &nbsp;Inform them they are being filmed. &nbsp;Ask them for their name and badge number. &nbsp;Depending on how spirited you're feeling you may want to tell them you are "not driving commercially and you do not wish to contract with them."</p>
<p>Step 1. &nbsp;"Am I being detained?" &nbsp;See, the cops can either arrest you or not. &nbsp;They can't randomly stop you and hold you. &nbsp;They have a binary choice arrest or not arrest. &nbsp;If they say "no" ask "Am I free to go?" &nbsp;If yes, GTFO. &nbsp;If no repeat step 1.</p>
<p>Step 2. When they say you are being detained ask them "What crime have I committed? &nbsp;What crime do you suspect I have committed?" &nbsp;They can't hold you if they don't suspect you have committed a crime.</p>
<p>Step 2a. &nbsp;They will tell you lots of bullshit. &nbsp;They may lie to you. &nbsp;They will use whatever reason they can to hold you there ang get you to answer their questions. &nbsp;Those questions are designed to get you to self incriminate any mis dead and escalate traffic stops to drug/alcohol busts. &nbsp;Don't answer their questions. &nbsp;Say "I don't answer questions. &nbsp;What crime do you suspect that I've committed."</p>
<p>Step 3. &nbsp;"I am a private person driving non-commercially. &nbsp;I am lawfully allowed to travel on public roads without your illegal and unwarranted inspections, and that's protected in the constitution by both the 4th and 9th amendment. &nbsp;You are acting in dishonor by holding me without sharing what crimes you suspect I have committed. &nbsp;Am I being detained? Am I free to go?"</p>
<p>The constitution doesn't give you rights. &nbsp;Being alive does. &nbsp;The constitution clarifies limitations on the government so they don't overstep their boundaries.</p>
<p>4th Amendment: &nbsp;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically they can't just randomly stop you and search you. &nbsp;They have to think you are committing a crime and have probable cause to search you. &nbsp;If they don't have they they are acting unlawfully.</p>
<p>9th Amendment: The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically this thing claims any right we didn't claim lives with the people and not the government to decide. &nbsp;The constitution doesn't explicitly claim how many times you can brush your teeth in a a day. &nbsp;Your freedom to choose that is codified in the 9th amendment. &nbsp;The constitution doesn't say you have a right to be on a road free from harassment from government, but it is claimed in the 9th amendment.</p>
<p>You should also know there is a difference between legal and lawful. &nbsp;The state or local group may have passed a law that says that people can be searched at a DUI checkpoint. &nbsp;There is a code the officer will stand behind, but while that code is legal it isn't lawful because it denies human rights or is being applied incorrectly. &nbsp;The state has the right to govern commerce, so if you're driving commercially like a big truck or uber they have the right to govern your behavior. &nbsp;The problem is they apply it to everyday people who they don't have a right to boss around without probable cause. &nbsp;So, you're going to get some tricky responses.</p>
<p>You have to be careful when doing this because I've seen it go both ways. &nbsp;The officer calls a supervisor. &nbsp;That supervisor realizes their job is a sham and since you clearly know your actual rights you're the wrong person to mess with. &nbsp;They say have a nice day and you drive off.</p>
<p>The other way this goes is shit escalates. &nbsp;They force you out of the car. &nbsp;They put you in a temporary holding cell while they do a criminal background check. &nbsp;They strip you of some of your belongings and run your plate and license. &nbsp;It's a shitty experience. &nbsp;Mine was made worse by some dipshit cop on his fat ass from his desk chair "oh, we got a wise guy today." &nbsp;If you definition of wise guy is "one who does not like highly militarized police creation unlawful checkpoints and enforcing code violations against god given and constitutionally secured rights" then I guess I'm a wise guy. &nbsp;It's a simple way to protest and at least provide the cop with 6 months of education to back his vast wisdom at the point of a gun question what he may have learned. &nbsp;But I digress, traffic stop rights flexing can go south pretty quickly. &nbsp;Stay calm, don't give them an excuse to execute you, and stand your ground.</p>
<p>The cops have mostly been lied to too. &nbsp;So it's not entirely their fault. &nbsp;They are also picked because of their willingness to push the authoritarian line so they are predisposed to be a boot licking statist enforcer/grunt before they ever get to your car. &nbsp;So, try not to lash out at them (it won't help if you lose your cool), but instead be professional and take it as an opportunity to flex your rights while hopefully educating an easily provoked neanderthal.</p>
<p>Good luck out there.</p>
