I don't know if I'm just a glutton for punishment, but I've spent a few hours watching the market as it's done some extra heavy correction over the last 24 hours.  I'm watching money in the spreadsheet evaporate while also digging into some cash I had to buy in.  Since I'm not playing with stake I cashed out at the highs this still feels like a gamble rather than a free roll.

I've been watching trading view.  I'm willing the chart with my mind to go back within the triangle so it really does look more like a bullish wick then it would a delay to a crash.  It keeps ticking up and down.  The ups I don't mind, but the downs are frustrating.  I can make money again in more traditional ways if I have to.  I just don't want to be wrong and either disappoint my spouse or face ridicule from friends and family.

I keep coming back to the simple thought that the people involved in this are revolutionaries.  You're gonna have to pry my keys from my cold dead hands before I give up crypto.  I imagine that many others are like that too.  We live this.  We love this.  We see how it's changing the world.  Maybe from big finance won't back that up, but I'm pretty sure there will be people, and if there's lots of people then money will follow.

I can't tell you that I'm not nervous.  But I can tell you I feel like we'll make it through this.  Steem's still at $3 even after btc got knocked down pretty hard.  That's a strong plus.  Back in November I'd still be hoping for $3.  Just had to take the high road to get there.
