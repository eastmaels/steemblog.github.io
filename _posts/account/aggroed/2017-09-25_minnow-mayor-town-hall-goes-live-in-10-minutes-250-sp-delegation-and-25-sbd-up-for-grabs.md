Hey folks in case you missed my last show with @klye you can check that out here- 

https://soundcloud.com/user-519267470/klyeandaggroed

Pretty fun conversation with a talented Dev, former and reformed asshat, and current Top 20 Witness.  We covered a fair amount of ground, but mostly shared some laughs and talked about all the ways we screwed up our entry on the server, but found forgiveness and a place anyway.

## Delegation <h2>

I'm going live tonight, no guests, so a laid back rock, 90s rock, and classic rock show.  I'm looking forward to hanging out with you all soon.

Delegation will be settled the normal way.  Recruit folks to the radio show, add YOURSELF and the person you recrutied to the list, and then we'll roll for it.  If we roll a 1 I'll push it to next week.

## Dice Bitches <h2>

We'll be playing dice bitches tonight for 25 sbd.  

Everyone gets to roll in round 1.
If you tie my roll or beat it you get to roll in the next round.
If my role beats yours please don't roll.

We start with t!dice 15d15 and then go down to 14d14 and so on to keep track of rolls.

If I win the first game then we start from scratch.  If I win the second game then the SBD will be sent to @minnowsupport.

SHould be a fun show and I can't wait to see you there!!!
