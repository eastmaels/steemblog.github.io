Fuck, I would have made a killing if I just could have sold more Steem.  Every damn time.  Somebody gets a fool notion that the price will actually go up for realz... but it won't.  Because as soon as it makes any headway every whale starts cashing out as quick as they can.  Until we don't have whales cashing out we can't get a price increase to stick.  So, if there is a price rush up the smartest thing to do is sell everything you got into it.  I just wish I coulda sold more than 1-2k steem sitting in my account.
