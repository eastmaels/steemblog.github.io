Msp-Waves is proud to present its newest radio show, The Peace Academy with @aggroed and @isaria.

The Peace Academy is a service brought to you by The Minnow Support Project and the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel.  It was created by @aggroed who has enlisted the help of @isaria to bring it to fruition.

The Peace Academy is meant to help relatively healthy people (physically and emotionally) learn how to demonstrate peace as frequently as possible. It is not a rehabilitation service at this time, but instead is designed to help Steemit and MSP community members learn to interact peacefully with one another and to demonstrate what that looks like when that is executed well. 

@aggroed and @isaria will be presenting these ideas during the radio show as well as discussing the concepts of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty and how we can best implement them here in our community, as well as in our daily lives.
