I'm trying to do a million things at once.  Get my kids to bed, start up my stream, populate Steem Monsters with 20 tournaments, and get this game ready.

There's already been one successful tournament tonight.  I'm looking to make it two.  Check out steemmonsters.com and let's go play!

I'll be live at mspwaves.com/listen and on air at minnowpond.org
