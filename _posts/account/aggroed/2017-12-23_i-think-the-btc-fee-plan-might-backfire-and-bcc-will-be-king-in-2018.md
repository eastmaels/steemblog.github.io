So, @davidpakman did an interview with Roger Ver from Bitcoin Cash.  Ver seems like my kinda guy.  From that interview I think he'd support the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  He kept repeating a point that did actually stick with me.  So, firstly I think he understands marketing and messaging and second I think he has a point.

The BTC folks are celebrating the high fees and trying to build btc as a store of wealth more than a tradeable token.  I think the store of wealth thing may go over well, but I think the fees are excessive.  Ver described them popping champagne bottles open when the fees overtook the block production costs.  I can't verify that, but it does seem like the community behind btc has been promoting it.

So, I've had some fears that btc has been taken over by big banking institutions and the first thing that I really see happening is some massive fees... that sounds like big banking to me.  Initally I thought BTC was the good guy and BCC might be the bad one, but I think I have to reverse my thinking here.  I barely hold any btc and don't plan on holding much.  I'm pretty sure I don't like it as a coin, but that may change as things develop.  Anyway, the point of high reliability, good network speed, and low cost I think will resonate for a lot of folks and a cash/currency model will ultimately play better in the market than an expensive store of value.  

Let's face it the other coins store value too.  They just don't cost you an assload to do it.

So, not that I'm into either of those, but I think I'm gonna start rooting for BCC.  Also, I'm seeing Steem at $3.30 while BTC is at $15.  Either Steem is starting to be more heavily priced based on the price of BTC or the price correlation between btc and Steem may have weakened.  Funky times for sure.

What do you think?  Which do you prefer?  What are your price predictions for the end of 2018 for BTC, BCC, and Steem?

I'm by no means a good crypto trader, so don't take this as advice so much as starting a conversation about it.
