The next big panel discussion starts in one hour.  I'm pleased to say there's a great panel ready for you today.  We have a ton of technical expertise assembled with developers and project leaders for Steem based social media programs and we have some wonderful media personalities representing millions of media subscribers.  

The technology folks are looking for more people to adopt their products.
Steem is looking to get our existence broadcast to the world.
Media personalities are looking for sustainable revenue especially in an adpocolypse and shadow banning landscape.

I think we can all find some wonderful overlap here, and talk about how we can support one another as a community.
