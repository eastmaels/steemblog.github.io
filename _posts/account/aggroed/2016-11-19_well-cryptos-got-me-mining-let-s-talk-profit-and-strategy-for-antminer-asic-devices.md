<p>Lots of people talk about the steemit community. &nbsp;There are those that are angry at the community, especially the flaggers that run around down voting shit for the lolz. &nbsp;There are steemfesters that run around praising anyone and everyone with a tear in their eye about the quality of people that love and work with steem. &nbsp;I see validity in both. &nbsp;I've been targetted by a flagger for a while, so there are some idiots out here. &nbsp;I also have gotten some serious help from @crytos, so at the moment I have starry eyes for one other bearded white dude around here. &nbsp;There is some epic awesomeness that abounds (part of why I stay despite shitty rewards and an oligarchy economy).</p>

<p>Anyway, so I thought I'd try my hand at mining bitcoins and altcoins. &nbsp;Yes, Steemit introduced me to crypto and yes the community was cool enough to help me, and so yes, now I'm mining and escalating...</p>
<p>It all started off when @cryptos wrote his article <a href="https://steemit.com/mining/@cryptos/how-to-easily-mine-with-your-computer-and-get-more-steem-a-guide-for-people-not-into-crypto-currencies">how to mine with nicehash</a>.</p>
<p>I found a cheap offer from Newegg for an antminer s7-LN ($350). &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.antminerdistribution.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F05%2Fside-view-1024x831.jpg&amp;f=1" width="1024" height="831"/></p>
<p>Here's my breif review of that. &nbsp;The antminer S7-LN makes for a wonderful introduction to bitcoin miner for the home enthusiast that doesn't actually want to make money, needs a loud/powerful space heater, or is happy to steal electricity from someone else to profit. &nbsp;This is more convenient and a better entry point for most as the power supply comes with it and pre-hooked up for those that lack basic technical capabilities. &nbsp;The "quieter" fans are still able to distort most conversations around you.</p>
<p>The antminer setup electronically wasn't brutal. &nbsp;You download a program to help find it's IP address. &nbsp;You push the button and shout at the device a few times and then it beeps and you have an ip address. &nbsp;You log in by typing that address into your URL and using the username and password "root." &nbsp;Now you're ready to dive into the software. &nbsp;The main thing you need at this point is the URL for the place you want to mine, and a bitcoin address. &nbsp;You alter the urls in the miner config and you can see the result in miner status.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/04685f2ecd.jpg" width="1689" height="385"/></p>
<p>I'm connected to Nicehash, and it sells my hashing power and deposits every two days into my wallet address, which itself is a blocktrades account that is now converting it to steem and putting that in my wallet. &nbsp;As you can see almost all of the work goes through there. &nbsp;I have a second account at bitminter, which doesn't appear to be the world's greatest pool, but it's fine for now. &nbsp;I haven't changed the last pool which goes back to antminer. &nbsp;I'm still looking around at pools to figure out how I'm going to configure this thing in the long run (or sell it after this winter).</p>
<p>Let's do a little math-</p>
<p>antminer draws 740 watts at the wall.</p>
<p>24 hours in a day</p>
<p>$0.19/KW</p>
<p>=$3.37 per day in electricity costs (gotta divide by a thousand because I put it watts rather than KW for the antminer)</p>
<p>What's it making?</p>
<p>It's pretty steady at 2.9Th/s. &nbsp;That sells for .0034 btc/day right now.</p>
<p>More math-</p>
<p>0.0034 btc * 747 USD/btc = $2.54</p>
<p>Now, we take the $3.37- $2.54= and I'm losing $0.83 cents per day.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So, that's not good. &nbsp;Things that can help that...</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The selling price of my hashing power goes up ie a giant warehouse filled with antminers catches fire and supply gets quartered. &nbsp;I don't see this one happening...</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;The price of my electricity goes down. &nbsp;I could make this work either with solar/wind. &nbsp;That said, if I buy a solar panel and give myself cheap power it means that I actually get a profit and a positive value for ROI on the mining rig, but that ruins my chance of a profit or positive ROI on the &nbsp;solar cells making that a bad investment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;I start stealing power. &nbsp;I don't have an office at a work place. &nbsp;So I can't just walk in and hook this thing up. &nbsp;For now I like my neighbors. &nbsp;I'm considering finding some college kids that want to hook this thing up in their room, but the heat and noise make that unnatractive. &nbsp;I'm still considering my unethical options. &nbsp;That said with free power this thing makes $2.54/day or $920/yr.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Find a use for the heat, which probably still isn't profitable. I have a crawl space where I worry about my water pipe freezing. &nbsp;I could put it in there to make sure that the thing doesn't freeze over a super cold winter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So, my options now are to purchase some sweet ass Antminer 9s and go into the mine war or try GPU mining.</p>
<p>Let's look at Antminer 9 Profitability. &nbsp;It's 13 TH/s and boasts .098 watts/gh. &nbsp;That means it will pull about 1274 at the wall.</p>
<p>My antminer S7-LN is 2.9 TH and uses 740 watts at the wall. &nbsp;So, I'm .255 watts/gh. &nbsp;That's ugly.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Based on a few ratios it looks like the antminer would make $11.38/day in my house. &nbsp;It will cost $5.80 to run it. &nbsp;So, that thing actually looks profitable. &nbsp;It makes $2037 in a year right now. &nbsp;So, if you can use it for a year and get the same return all year you can pay it off in year one and every year after that is just gravy. &nbsp;When you're done you can probably sell the thing to a guy like me just starting who is willing to buy the thing that may not be profitable at that point to figure out how it all works. &nbsp;You might also find the unethical version of me who is willing to buy it because it's not profitable for someone that pays or electricity, but still makes lots for someone that steals it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Maybe I'll get an antminer 9. &nbsp;I'll compare that to GPU mining in part 2.</p>
