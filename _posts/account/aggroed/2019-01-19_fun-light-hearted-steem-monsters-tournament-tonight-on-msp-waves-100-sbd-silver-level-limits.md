Ok, getting back to some Steem Monsters action!  We'll be having a Steem Monsters Tournament Tonight.  Starts in 3 hours.  Check in will start 15 min before the show.  The tournament will likely start just after 8pm EST.

I think I'm being joined by @isaria and maybe even @swelker101... who knows, but someone can join me and we can talk through some matches.

There's the challonge.  See you in there!

If I can some time I'll try to toss some level 5 commons around to players too that stick around for the show!
