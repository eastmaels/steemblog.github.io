There's a term out there called Sovereign Citizen.  This term makes no sense.  A sovereign is in charge of their own person and belongings.   A Citizen is a member of a political entity that has rules and laws etc.  These two things are inherently at odds.  It's not a paradox.  It's impossible.

So, what then am I talking about?  Lemme give a super brief history.  You're a slave and the system currently owns you.  The birth certificate, driver's lisence, passport, voter registration, all pull you into the commerical system that the banksters have setup.  You think you're working with a de jure government, but the reality is that it's a literal corporation.  It has been since at least the civil war.  The actual government has nobody in it or working for it and the corporation claims to represent it. 

## Coming to terms with this

There are two videos I strongly recommend to get you started here.

UNGRIP  and What the FUQ?

These two videos can help walk you through trying to figure out what it is we're dealing with.  UNGRIP also presents some solutions in terms of how to respond and move away from the violence of the state.  

## Anna Von Reitz

Ok, so another approach to dealing with this has been put forward by Anna von Reitz.  She's a "Judge" in the American government.  She's not workign for the corporation.  She's working for the de jure government she's trying to reestablish.  Her website is annavonreitz.com and has a thousand letters describing the basic challenges to American Sovereignty that we as a nation face.

Here's an example of a letter she's written recently working to shove these corporate genies back into their bottles.

## Heather Ann Tucci-Jerraf

Another approach has been lead by HATJ.  She's another that's trying to fight this system.  They created and dissolved an entity called the One People's Public Trust.  This happened around 2012.  It basically was the first rebuttle to the Pope claiming to be Vicar of Christ and owning everything on Earth.  These actions provided a legal ground for the people to own themselves and claim there is no intermediary between a human and it's creator.  It's difficult to confirm that the crazy changes in the world relate back to this released document and the work they have done since, but they are attempting to expose the corruption as well.  


They documented a lot fo the wrong doing in what's called the [Paradigm Report](https://www.scribd.com/doc/143427796/118067922-Paradigm-Document-From-the-Treasury-Finance-Ag-Industriestrasse-21-Ch-6055alpnach-Dorf-Switzerland) and since worked on a number of other documents.  

Heather is currently fighting a prison sentence.  She and one of her buddies were able to withdraw hundreds of millions of dollars from the banking system and then were arrested for having done it.  She's patiently trying to deal with the legal system.  Farnkly I'm amazed they haven't murdered her, but she seems to be making progress.

Here's a recent approach to fighting them.  If it appears weird it's because it is, and will take a lot of unwinding one's brain to see how she's bringing essentially common law to bear on the maratime/administrative/admirality/commercial law practiced by the US corp.

[HATJ court doc](https://www.dropbox.com/s/szbnpz290gwrqqa/%23176%20-%20STANDING%20PRAECIPE%20DECLARATIONS%20OF%20DUE%20CAUSE%20etc..pdf?dl=0)

## Folks looking to assemble and fight this beast may consider the National Assembly

[Assembly Website](https://www.national-assembly.net/)

The general idea is that some of what the pilgrims did to establish a lawful nation worked and was able to separate from the corporate state.  They are attempting to reproduce someo f that know and keep their boundaries.  As weird as it may appear to be the corporations appear to respect these things when they are presented lawfully.  Determining what is lawful tends to be tricky and even then the criminals don't always appear to follow it... 

For anyone that thought beating back a multi hundred year old entity that has been robbing us blind to the tune of trillions of dollars would be easy, clean or neat, I'm sorry to disappoint.
