Well, the little fund raiser I planned for a single mom to help her out turned into a generosity fest of around 900SBDs.  I know some more are coming too.  Every now and then this community makes me weep, and this is one them.  I think @clevercreator is in a better spot today than yesterday.  You guys are awesome!

Honestly, it started when I saw the donation that @ausbitbank made.  That guy has been through hell with his family. He has two non verbal autistic kids and he's publicly stated it's cost him over $300,000 on therapy so far.  He and his wife have sacrificed so much to give their kids some quality of life.  I'll stay up late chatting with him over Discord and he'll personally share various bits of hardship that his family goes through financially, emotionally, and medically.  I know his house needs repair, and I know he's living a modest lifestyle.  So, when that dude breaks out a 200 SBD donation to help a stranger on another continent... I have no words.  I'm just grateful to find people like that at all let alone be literally surrounded by people like that on here.  Aus, you're my brother.  Thanks for doing this journey with me.

@benjojo thought he might have escaped from this too, but nope.  Here's another example of maximum philanthropy.  Dude let's @minnowsupport sit on a 90k SP delegation for months.  He asks nothing in return.  Not even a fucking resteem or something.  He's just happy to see minnows growing because of it.  So, without a stake he's still able to grow his account because people like him and he's a great author and has creative works coming out.  So, what's he do.  He donates.  He tosses out 60 SBD to the single mom that needs help like he's just getting breakfast.  It's incredible to me to see how he just operates on the condition of generosity and I hope to emulate it if I'm able to grow pure huge on here.

@steemitqa deserves a special mention too.  He's not a rich guy.   I know that.  But he's in there with a 50 SBD donation too.  Steemitqa has the honor of being the funniest Steemian I know.  He hangs out in Steemspeak all the time and is the only guy out there dropping more and funnnier wisecracks than me.  He's hilarious, a blast, and a very kind soul.  If you're interested in ZAPPL and making Steemit more like some of the other social media platforms he's your man.  I think they're fund raising now too.

I couldn't forget the minnows either.  Both people in general, but more specifically the Minnow Support Project.  You can check the logs and see that lots of people are giving what they can in 2 SBD to 10 SBD batches.  If you cross reference that with folks in the PALnet Discord channel you'll see some very familiar faces.  These are people working day and night trying to make it on Steemit who put hours into posts that get a dozen views and a few bucks.  They're also in there donating what they can.

@isaria, @gmuxx, @abh12345, @ilyastarar, @gmuxx, @calamus056, @morodiene, @drpuffnstuff, @neoxian, @dogeking, @drakos.  I hope it's not your turn for something like this, but you can bet your ass I'll be there for you too when it is.

I saw a bunch of people not only send donations, but also topped off some of her active posts.  @ausbitbank did that, @canadian-coconut did that, @calamus056 did that.  I need to think up a generosity medal...

Anyway, I'm sorry to be a weepy sap on here a bunch, but when I'm not thrashing about the immoral banksters that cause violence and run the world I'm just a dude that wants to sit back, make jokes, and laugh in peace and abundance with my friends.  They're easy to find on this platform, and I'm grateful to be here and grateful to this community.

Many blessings of peace, abundance, and liberty to you and yours and I stand in awe of your generosity.
