<p>In what appears to be a rapid escalation of pro-Harambe political views Trump tweets an armed selfie with text stating "Don't go to the Cincinnati Zoo tomorrow!" and "#DO4H." &nbsp;</p>

<p>It appears Trump started early last night with a brief internet session that ended up lasting way into the night. &nbsp;He posted a few other pro-Harambe memes before finally posting his armed selfie.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He retweeted Mike Cernovich's post where a Harambe meme ended up on MSNBC live television.</p>

<p>He mocked Hillary Clinton-</p>

<p>At that point it appears excessive alcohol consumption may have been a factor. &nbsp;To be clear, the selfie is part of a meme that indicates to its audience pre-meditated plans to "shoot up" the Cincinnati Zoo as a "revenge killing" for how they incapacitated and put down their Gorilla to save the child's life. &nbsp;As a result of the violent remarks Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and FBI have contacted the candidate and some in the media speculate he will be detained for his posts.</p>
