<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: HRC to hold an open and honest press conference on a green screen with press surrounded by deep state snipers.</p>
<p>While on the campaign trial Hillary Clinton has promised to be more accessible and transparent with to voters through use of the press. &nbsp;She considered her <a href="https://steemit.com/writing/@aggroed/satirically-yours-series-s1e1-hrc-to-rename-airforce-one-to-ambulance-one-upon-election-victory">Ambulance One</a> appearance with the press a glowing success. &nbsp;As you can see in those photo they were all excited to greet her as they would lob soft ball questions her way. &nbsp;She was able to complete roughly 90 seconds of answering questions before succumbing to her coughing fit. &nbsp;With so little accomplished she was quick to reach out to voters again. &nbsp;</p>

<p>She greeted her fans in Cleveland. &nbsp;It took a moment to get the words back as she held in her emotions and again seemed to have a little something in her throat. &nbsp;Even MSNBS eventually cut their feed on the conference.</p>

<p>After vowing to come back from the lack luster performance that now has her down in the polls the Clinton campaign has decided to turn to technology to help. &nbsp;Recently it's been discovered that highly advanced facial re-enactment software will allow actors to combine their speech and motion with a digital input of the target speaker to create a nearly seamless user experience such that they believe the target speaker is out there delivering the lines. &nbsp;</p>

<p>With a plan motion the HRC camp plans on allowing reporters into a contained zone where they are free to ask any questions they would like standing under the watchful and fatherly eye of 15 highly trained Secret Service and Delta force snipers. &nbsp;Questions regarding any content are more than welcome although mention of previous news cycle information such as <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/dnc-wikileaks-shocking-revelations-bernie-sanders-arina-grande-wasserman-schultz-democrat/">wikileaks hack</a>, <a href="http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/leaked-docs-prove-election-rigged-favor-hillary/">rigging the primary</a>, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/439804/clintons-e-mail-scandal-stinkier-stinkier-documents-destroyed-after-subpoena">Bleach Bit</a>, <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system">FBI Comey's stunning statements</a>, <a href="http://www.snopes.com/seth-conrad-rich/">Seth Rich</a>, <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/01/benghazi-story-hillary-clinton-doesnt-want-you-to-know/">Benghazi</a>, <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/282261-sanders-clinton-foundation-engaged-in-conflicts-of">activities of the Clinton Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2016/08/23/clinton-foundations-alleged-pay-to-play-or-its-private-benefits-which-hurts-hillary-more/#7b3438497a43">pay to play activities of the Secretary of State's office</a>, <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/wikileaks-exposes-clinton-isis/">funding of ISIS</a>, <a href="http://intrendtoday.com/breaking-wikileaks-confirms-hillary-sold-weapons-isis/">arming of ISIS</a>,<a href="http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/huge-scandal-chelsea-isnt-bill-clintons-daughter/"> the actual father of chelsea clinton</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Lewinsky">previous scandals involving her husband's presidency</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LYRUOd_QoM">selling uranium mining rights to the Russians</a>, and others are discouraged for being too boring for mainstream enjoyment.</p>
<p>Reporters are likely to ask savage questions like "how does it feel to be so empowering to other women?" "or what does it feel like to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Woodhull">first woman nominated</a> by their party to be president?" and other earth shattering questions so stay tuned. &nbsp;Lastly, expectations are strong that a similar team of snipers will be dispatched soon to an unidentified location involving a new singer on the scene.</p>
