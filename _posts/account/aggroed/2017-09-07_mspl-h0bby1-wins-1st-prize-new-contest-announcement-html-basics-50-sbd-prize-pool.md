Congratulations to @h0bby1.  In addition to your post earning $150 You're also getting an additional 50 SBD from me!!!  (You didn't put the post in the comments, so I missed the resteem window otherwise I would have done that too!)

Here's the winning post on the basics of Linux!

## Time to archive <h2>

I'm going to send this link off to steemshelves through @rhondak and you're officially in the MSPL!!!

## Next Contest: HTML <h2>

Let's keep this baby rolling!  We're trying to help people become developers and provide some posts that will encourage them.  Before we get to actually coding on the block chain let's get some basic programming stuff in the library.  I'm running a contest to write about coding so we can build a library about it (everything gets archived at steemshelves.com).  The best post will get 50 SBD from me, archived in the library, resteemed, and probably some fat post rewards on it's own.

What we're looking for here is for you to make a post that covers some of the basics of writing in HTML.  It's eventually meant to help people build and design applications for the Steemit blockchain, so while you're writing please keep that in mind.

You can use @h0bby1's guide as a starting point.  I'd ask that you consider adding a video as well.  But just walk us through HTML.

If you write a post, tag it with MSPL, and link it in the comments in here.  I'll resteem it, so even if you don't win the contest you'll get some sweet exposure (and I have some good whales who would be happy to support someone on a topic like this that follow me).

So, HMTL basics, write like you're talking to a total noob (more advanced stuff later), tell us where HTML is a good fit, and walk us through the some of the starting commands, link the post you make in the comments below, and you have a good shot at sitting 50 SBD + post rewards richer.

## Good Luck! <h2>
