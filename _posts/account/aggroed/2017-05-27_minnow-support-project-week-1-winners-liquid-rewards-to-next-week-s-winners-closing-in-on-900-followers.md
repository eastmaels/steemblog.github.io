If you missed the first post in the series check it out here: https://steemit.com/minnowsupportproject/@aggroed/minnow-support-project-weekly-minnow-resteem

After having my own follower count explode after having been shared by some highly followed characters on steemit; @fyrstikken and @kaylinart, I decided I wanted to pay it forward and start a weekly resteem.  Going forward the plan is to post a new Minnow Support Project on Monday so folks can post links to their articles in the comments.  Then I'll announce winners, pay winners, and resteem posts on Thursdays.  This first week it started on a Thursday so it didn't quite work like that, but going forward it will.

## So, here are the rules <h2>
For every 100 upvotes I'll resteem a follower
To be able to get a resteem simply link your post (or a referral if you want) in the comments section. Make sure there are at least 3 days left on the post rewards because I'm not going to resteem right away.
The first resteem is the post that gets the most upvotes, comments that have been robo voted are likely to be excluded.
The second resteem is the post I think is best.  I'm judging by what will support my mission of Peace, Abundance and Liberty.
Third vote and up is based on the post with the highest rewards.

## What's a minnow? <h2>
Others may have different definitions than mine, but for the purpose of this contest a minnow is anyone that at the time they post in the comment section have less than 5,000SP and under 500 followers.

## Winners! <h2>
First winner comes from @fraenk for their beautiful photography- https://steemit.com/colorchallenge/@fraenk/colorchallenge-sevendayssevencolors-my-whole-week-summed-up-spoiler-i-made-my-first-100usd-on-steemit-yay

Second winner comes from @jdawg for his post about diversifying out of the USD- https://steemit.com/money/@jdawg/diversify-out-of-the-dollar

I'm going to send 20SBD to @fraenk and 10SBD to @jdawg!

## Congratulations <h2>


I hope I can help you out as much as some follower whales helped me.  Be sure to tune in on Monday and get your posts linked early for your best chance to win!

Lastly, I'll be announcing a witness campaign next week.  Please support me!
