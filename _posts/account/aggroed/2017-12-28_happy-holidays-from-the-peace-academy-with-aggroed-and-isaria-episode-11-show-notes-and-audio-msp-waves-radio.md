# <center> Show Highlights  </center>

* Anarchy is not a noun, but an adjective (or a verb)

* Listened to “Anarchy” by Utah Phillips which describes the delta between coercive force and voluntary action


* We all have a tendency to cause violence so we must make a constant effort to stray from the path of violence and instead create a constant, conscious effort to enact peace


* It is our responsibility to step back and look at the rigged system that we currently have and ask ourselves if it is serving the needs of humanity


* We can’t change the system from the inside

* We can however remove our consent and resist through education, connecting people, protest
