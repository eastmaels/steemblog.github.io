<p>Before you go investing your shirt into Steem because of the recent price rise I just want to draw your attention to something. &nbsp;Above you can see the price of steem relative to btc. &nbsp;Steem looks to have been hammered for a little bit, and now appears to be on the rebound. &nbsp;You might get some greed into your eyes thinking about buying into that up trend, but I don't thinka it means what you thinka it means.</p>
<p>Steem isn't priced to dollars on poloniex. &nbsp;It's priced to bitcoin. &nbsp;Bitcoin fluctuates like a mofo. &nbsp;What you see below is the price chart for BTC vs USD. &nbsp;The story goes that Chinese people suddenly started investing in bitcoin real quick. &nbsp;I don't know if I believe that or not, but you can see a quick pump from the hype, and now we're dropping back down. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the logic: &nbsp;Price of bitcoin goes up. &nbsp;Steem stays the same price/usd. &nbsp;So the amount of btc needed to purchase a steem goes down. &nbsp;So, the price drops. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, the hype fades. &nbsp;The price of bitcoin comes down. &nbsp;Steem stayed the same price/usd. &nbsp;So, the amount of btc needed to purchase a steem goes up. &nbsp;So, the price (in terms of btc) rises.</p>

<p>You're not looking at investors suddenly swarming to steemit. &nbsp;You're looking at investors pricing it correctly now that BTC has dropped. &nbsp;The price per btc will keep rising because it looks like the chinese thing was all hype (pump and dump). &nbsp;So, you can go back to your regularly scheduled impending drop in steem price.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>System Inflation is high, witnesses and miners currently take too large of a stake of the rewards, in the three months I've been here the corporate account has grown from 74M steem to 88M while doing absolutely nothing, the place is an oligarchy with the top 100 accounts having the vast majority of all the steem, and the low price means that bloggers aren't sticking around so we're under 3k users on a given day. &nbsp;Those are the users who buy into this place and so there aren't really enough people to purchase the 150M steem that's waiting around to get sold by the 3k users so the price is going to keep dropping.</p>
<p>So, I'm sticking with my current predictions:</p>
<p>Steem to $0.01 in <a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@aggroed/steem-prediction-steem-will-drop-below-usd0-01-by-december">December</a></p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@aggroed/steem-keeps-falling-the-silence-is-deafening">Price of steem</a> is falling</p>

<p>I'm going to keep my shirt on my back and my day job for now. &nbsp;</p>
