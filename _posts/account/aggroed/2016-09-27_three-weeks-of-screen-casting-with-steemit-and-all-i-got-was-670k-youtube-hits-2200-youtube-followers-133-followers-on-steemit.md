<p>So, it's been an interesting three weeks. &nbsp;I started screen casting and made a fresh YouTube channel on September 6th. &nbsp;At the time I was about three weeks old on steemit, and really hadn't gotten anywhere with it. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://s10.postimg.org/jia7xb5uh/youtube_start.jpg" width="1173" height="761"/>One of my main points of interest was to discuss the Mandela Effect. &nbsp;It's this weird thing where what large groups of people remember in specific detail is not what matches recorded history. &nbsp;I started with a 90 min screen cast on a paper I wrote using data from 25,120 people that took a survey/quiz. &nbsp;After that I did a few more Mandela Effect videos to show "reality residue" for a few examples. &nbsp;Mandela Effect researchers think of Reality Residue as leftover evidence from a different world merging into this one. &nbsp;Those that tend to doubt the changes that are occuring think of those same things as the cause of why everyone seems to misremember specifics or be confused.</p>
<p>If you build it ___ will come</p>
<p>______ mirror on the wall</p>
<p>Berenst*in Bears</p>
<p>X number of people were in the car with JFK when he was assassinated</p>
<p>You can quiz yourself on the pop culture ones <a href="http://www.quiz-maker.com/QRVR3A">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can take a <a href="http://www.quiz-maker.com/QYN1BOG">short quiz</a> about the much more tangible ones here.</p>
<p>You can take a <a href="http://www.quiz-maker.com/Q6G9ZLT">big honking quiz</a> to&nbsp;get a much fuller sense of everything that may have changed around you.</p>
<p>The <a href=": http://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/lmhstore/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/14142037/Mandela-effect-25000-response-Final-1.pdf">PDF </a>is posted here.</p>
<p>Here's the screen cast I made about it.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe65g0K8ePc &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those videos didn't catch much fire, but there are many in the community of Mandela Effect researchers that have praised the work and thanked me for it. &nbsp;It actually turned out to be a nice starting point because I started using steemit as a sort of lab notebook. &nbsp;I could record all the things I had found on there and then I would talk over the steemit blog as a way to make the screencast.</p>
<p>I use a Blue Yeti microphone that's plug and play through a USB drive.</p>
<p><img src="https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://media.guitarcenter.com/is/image/MMGS7/Yeti-USB-Microphone/423203000000000-00-500x500.jpg" width="500" height="500"/></p>
<p>I purchased a license for Screencast o matic.</p>
<p><img src="https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://www.saintsteched.com/uploads/2/6/9/9/26990958/6522952_orig.jpg?250" width="450" height="300"/></p>
<p>Those two in particular make the actual production of everything super simple. &nbsp;Then I upload an FLV file to youtube and viola.</p>
<h1>Going Viral</h1>
<p>I've always liked following politics and when Clinton collapsed on 9/11 it was quite the deal. &nbsp;I started following that and tried to figure out what was wrong with her only to discover that she appears to be extremely ill and I later showed it's extremely likely she's employed 2 two body doubles since 9/11. &nbsp;This video now has 500k hits.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzFglNq0Thc</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That one alone accounts for 500k of the nearly 700k hits I have received. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of my videos have a ratio of like to dislike on the post of 10:1. &nbsp;For every 10 people that likes the video one person dislikes it. &nbsp;That's fine. &nbsp;It's not normal stuff. &nbsp;That said one of them got slammed.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DegGNEEJBrc</p>
<p>In that one I was in a rush and didn't bother making the Steemit blog first. &nbsp;I reviewed the content immediately as it came out and I didn't share any of the back story. &nbsp;A higher than normal group of people thought that I may have gone batshit crazy and this is my one video where the dislikes out pace the likes.</p>
<p>The moral of the story there was do my full homework every time. &nbsp;If I'm presenting controversial stuff in videos and I get new users they won't have any background in the material. &nbsp;It's especially important to build an introduction that supports the claims I'm going to make no matter how outrageous they may seem to someone that only casually pays attention or is still hooked to the mainstream media for their news feed.</p>
<p><a href="http://radiofetzer.blogspot.com/">Jim Fetzer </a>invited me onto his show. &nbsp;That was fun. &nbsp;He's a pretty hard Trump supporter, which I didn't really know at the time. &nbsp;I'm planning on exposing all of these crooks, but until then I guess I was more than happy to inflame and intellectually arm his audience with evidence that Crooked Hillary is using Body Doubles.</p>
<p>I also got to go on a show with Roger Landry from The Liberty Beacon, Randy Maugens from Off Planet Radio, and Dani McKenny from Removing the Shackles.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EJkQ4ZhiW8</p>
<p>I have another radio show that's in negotiation, and I just got offered one that I have a conversation about tonight. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think my point is that this platform is a pretty amazing thing. &nbsp;I like the improvements to the system that are made. &nbsp;I like what folks are building. &nbsp;I like how it's a great place to keep a record of what I'm working on.</p>
<p>If I have any advice for people who are hoping to get their stuff out there:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Keep the best record you can on here.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Interact with your audience while they are asking questions. &nbsp;You'll pickup new stuff from folks who comment with helpful suggestions and places to look into next.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Pick a hot button issue that people care about.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Do your homework and then put yourself out there.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>BerenstAin Bears, If you build it HE will come, Magic Mirror on the wall, 6 people in the car with JFK are the answers. &nbsp;If you remember something different you're experiencing the Mandela Effect.</p>
