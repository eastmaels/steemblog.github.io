So, you've heard about steemit.  You learned about the block chain.  You realize you can get paid for your posts.  You're now ready to blog... but what to write and how to grow?

## 1.  Pick a topic and stick with it for a while <h2>

While the general blog posts about the state of the union or even things like "Tips Starting out" can generate big rewards for the people that have been doing this a while you generally can't get away with it until you have some followers already.  You're better off writing about something that you know, is important to you, or captures the moment at the time you're writing.  So, while you're trying to get followers to start pick 1-2 topics and write about them.  If they resonate stick with them for the first 25-50 followers (which will be your hardest followers to get).

## 2.  Write an introduceyourself post <h2>

You'll pick up followers just from an introduction post that's well written.  In theory it should list your name, your image with a steemit logo in it somewhere, and some personalized tid bits about you.  If you do creative work show a portfolio.  If you care about a topic write a unique perspective.  If you're athletic maybe show a little skin.  If you can cook show some awesome food.  This platform will support a lot of users for a lot of different reasons.  Show your unique contributions.

## 3.  Don't give up!  Write a blog post every day <h2>

People want to follow active users.  If you're only posting once a week you're hardly going to gain traction with that.  Blogging on here with the intention to make something of it will take work.  Be sure to schedule time or find a pattern that supports your new writing habit.

## Bonus advice: Leave comments and try to chat with people you like <h2>

People do business with people they know.  You like something you read upvote it and leave a comment about why you liked it.  Maybe you'll find some people with similar taste.

STEEM ON!
