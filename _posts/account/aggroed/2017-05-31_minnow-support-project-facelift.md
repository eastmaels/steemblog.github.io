<p>Ok, so, as part of my aim to support new users on the platform I want to make the Minnow Support Project spiffy! &nbsp;Hot off the press is a new gif for the post series. &nbsp;It's created by @juanmiguelssalas. &nbsp;You might remember his work from this post: https://steemit.com/steemit/@juanmiguelsalas/9-animated-gifs-with-the-steemit-logo-to-use-in-your-post-or-to-promote-steemit</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Juan created 9 truly beautiful gifs for the whole community. &nbsp;It's because of that post that I reached out to him and asked him to create a Minnow Support Project gif. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>He created great work like this:</h3>

<h3>Side Note</h3>
<p>This is the exact kind of stuff that @stellabelle and her project can make so much easier for people to collaborate on projects. &nbsp;Here's hoping and supporting her so that we can all benefit from that too!</p>
