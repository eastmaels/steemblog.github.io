<p>The media was quick to come to the aid of the judge that sentenced her. &nbsp;"We have video footage of her spray painting that bulldozer. &nbsp;Her actions are dangerous as they clearly indicate a willingness to stop the North Dakota Access Pipeline, which is a substantial contributor to our advertising budgets."</p>
<p>Dakota Access, a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners, is the company to build the pipeline. &nbsp;Company spokesman shares the following after paying for the right to do so. &nbsp;"The Access Pipeline pipline is a $3.7B investment by our company. &nbsp;We tell the public it will create 8000-12000 short term construction jobs. &nbsp;More importantly it will carry up to a million barrels of oil every day. &nbsp;You know how much that's worth son? &nbsp;At $40/barrell it's $14.6B every year. &nbsp;You think we'll let her just stand out there, spray paint our vehicles, and pose a threat to this project? &nbsp;I'll tell you hwat!!! &nbsp;We'll pay any judge we have to in order to get the death sentence we're looking for. &nbsp;That oil is already ours and that money is ours, and no one, not even a presidential candidate is gonna get in the way of that!"</p>
<p>FBI Director Comey was quick to chime in on the incident.</p>

<p>"I want to ensure the American people that no candidate for President is above the law! &nbsp;She had herself filmed on camera doing these heinous acts. &nbsp;Profits could have been killed! &nbsp;&nbsp;Especially in cases like this where there are no threats to my life for protecting her, and to the contrary, there are threats to my life to ensure she's hung, I will do everything in my power to make sure justice is served. &nbsp;Under my watch no one is above the law especially when there is insurmountable evidence of exceptionally drastic and heinous treason against this country. &nbsp;Thank you."</p>
<p>As per laws governing media stories regarding Native American protest, we were prohibited from reaching out to the 4,000+ Native Americans from over 7 different tribes that haven't united like this in over a century in defense of their land.</p>
