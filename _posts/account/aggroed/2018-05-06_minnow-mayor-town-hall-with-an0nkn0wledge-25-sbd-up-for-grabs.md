Hey folks, glad to be coming atcha again with another episode of Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  I'm not exactly sure how many shows this is.  Minnow Support Project is around 11 months.  I've probably done 10 months of shows at this point.  40 episodes?!?  I don't know.  It's a lot.  I'm still going strong.  It's good times!!!

Today we're gonna start out with an open audience.  Anyone that hasn't been banned from PALnet is welcome to come onto the show and ask, declare, share, discuss w/e they want.  It's all good.  You can share literally anything.  Want to talk about a post you madE?  Sure!  Want to discuss bid bots?  Why not!  Want to talk about the UI for Steemit?  We're good.  Only rule for this is that you gotta stay cordial.  That's it.  We don't moderate the thoughts only the presentation (unless you're encouraging violence).

## Logistics

Hop into the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network](minnowpond.org).

Show starts in an hour.  

If you'd like to come on air join the waiting room.

If you'd like to chat join the audience channel.

##  Delegation

ok, probably don't need this disclaimer anymore, but one last one for the road.  No more individual delegations go out during the show.  You can however ask to get put onto msp-active.  That's an account I created to award active members of the Minnow Support Project community.

## Dice Bitches

25 SBD up for grabs.  I roll, you roll, and the game is rigged so I win...  We'll find a good charity if none of ya'll win for real.
