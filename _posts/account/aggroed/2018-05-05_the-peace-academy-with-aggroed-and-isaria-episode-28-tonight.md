Part of achieving and maintaining peace includes creating awareness and healthy boundaries.

Steemit is just a microcosm of our macrocosmic world.  It is not a perfect, utopian system.  
Unfortunately, just as there are people in the world with a scarcity mindset who steal from others, there are those on Steemit and Discord who will do the same.

The best that we can do is to create healthy boundaries, achieve awareness, and be the change of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty that we want to see in the world.

Tonight we will discuss ways to protect yourself on Steemit and live by the motto of 
***Do no harm, but take no shit.***

**_We also want to hear from you!_**

Be sure to join the audience chat during the show and let us know if you want to come on air with us!  
As long as what you have to say is about Peace, Abundance, or Liberty it's fair game!
