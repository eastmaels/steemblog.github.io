What a pleasure and honor to present to the Steem Community Sounds of Steem.  @isaria, @swelker101 and I were able to host nearly 3 hours of music and conversation with artists from around the Steem ecosystem.  During the live performance we had roughly 40-60 listeners at any time and well over a hundred people that join us live during at least a portion of the show.

As always my favorite part of this is hearing live music that sounds so different than what you get on the radio.  The radio is repetitive and boring.  You hear the same crappy love story about amorphous people sung in the same 3 chords a million ways.  Here we had songs about sorrow, about struggle, about love, whimsy, and parental advice.  It's hard to find this.  On top of that we were able to talk to the many Steem Musicians that performed and got to know about them, their music creation, and what their loves are.  It's so much fun to host this and looking forward to the next one!

I'll pay 10SBD to the first person that goes through and lists the artists and the times they perform in the comments below.
