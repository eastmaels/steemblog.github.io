Want to Go to STEEMFEST?  Are you a MINNOW?  The Minnow Support Project can help you go!

## Contest Rules <h2>

This is going to be done in 2 steps.  First step is judged solely by me and is meant to narrow down to 10 finalists.  
Second round includes many judges scoring from 1-10 and will be announced on Monday, June 26.
First round please write a post and then submit it as a comment in this post.

1.  At least a 1 paragraph bio
2.  Describe what you bring to STEEMFEST (not an object list, but what skills and talents you have that will improve it for everyone)
3. A budget

## Judging <h2>

Initial plan is judge solo for the first round.  I reserve the right to include others if I'm swamped here.
Judging is first based on who filled the requirements.
2nd Judging is based on who seems most likely to provide high quality representation of the minnow community.
3rd judging includes consideration of a thoughtful budget with favoritism towards those who cost less.

Votes and dollar value of the comment will be considered and weighed as part of the contest, but it won't determine who gets through.  If you think you have a good application be sure to campaign for it.

## Requirements <h2>

You must be a Minnow
You must have 500 or less followers as of Today.
You must have earned less than 5,000 SP from posting as of Today.
You must speak English and write your entry in English, but you can be from anywhere.
You must be a legal adult in your country of origin.

## Prizes <h2>

1.  All expense paid trip to STEEMFEST
2.  100 SBD
3.  50 SBD

## Alternate ways to get there <h2>

@theprophet0 started a rolling admission contest where he covers plane fare.
@steemfestdreams has a rolling admission contest too where some needs are met.

After STEEMFEST MINNOW I'll be working with them on those.

Any additional funds raised will go towards the Minnow Support Project community account.

## Round 2 <h2>

A second post must be written by the finalists and submitted as a comment to the followup announcement. You must include

1.  Mission statement
2.  Set of goals
3.  Effective plan

## Winner will be announced by @minnowsupport <h2>

So, make sure you follow that account.
