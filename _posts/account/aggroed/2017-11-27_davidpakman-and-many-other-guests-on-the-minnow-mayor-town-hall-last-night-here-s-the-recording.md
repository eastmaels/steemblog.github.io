Well, I'm trying to get into the habit of posting videos immediately after making them.  The Town Hall ran until Midnight and I was up until 1am trying to get the rest of the videos squared away.  This is basically a daddy all nighter, but I think it's good to share what we talked about on the show with the overall Steem audience.

## @davidpakman <h2>
I gotta tell you I like this guy.  I found David to be charming, smart, quick witted, and seems like a passionate crypto enthusiast.  Part of his journey is getting off of youtube because of demonitization of content that doesn't meet advertiser standards.  Personally, I think youtube is specifically targetting non-mainstream lines of thinking and censoring them and then blaming it on advertisers, but that isn't new.  I'm on Steem because facebook shadow banned my account 5 times after I had gotten it up to 2000+ followers over and over again.

Anyway, I think he's great, I think he's great for Steem, I think he'll bring an audience into the platform, and regardless of what you think about his politics I think he'll be a good advocate for the platform to his 400k subscribers.

Welcome to Steem David, and thanks for coming on mspwaves.

Lastly, David is planning on telling his audience about Steem and asking them to join.  Please be on the lookout for that post today and let's reward it with upvotes, resteems, bit bots, and some fan fare.
