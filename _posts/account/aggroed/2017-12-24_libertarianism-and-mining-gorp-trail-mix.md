This may seem like a silly question, but I have a minor ethical dilemna that showed up during a holiday party.   My second daughter went to go eat the GORP (a mix of nuts, raisins, and M&Ms).  Then I noticed that she started mining the gorp for the M&Ms.  My instinct was to say "Hey, don't mine those!"  It's from years of leading hiking trips and telling the freaking campers to not do that, but now I'm wondering what's the common libertarian/anarchist method for dealing with mining gorp, and if you're ready for it let's make it bigger.

## Limited Communal Resources <h2>

What this has turned into within my head is trying to figure out what the range of answers are for figuring out how to allocate limited physical resources.  This isn't a debate about are you allowed to own your pot smoking, heroine injecting, recreational nukes... I'm trying to limit it to something where there are simply limited resources and it's not really a trade/value thing.

Should I have told my daughter don't mine those?  I'm telling her what to do... that's not terribly libertarian, but I'm also trying to stay somewhat within social norms.  Where's the balance to that?

Who gets to determine how the resources are allocated?  Is it just the first person to start mining them?  Do they then have mining rights to them?  Should I be able to come in and mine in the exact same way?  How's this work?

## What about something like water? <h2>

There's a finite amount of fresh water in the world.  There are lots of people that want it.  How does a libertarian allocate it?  Simply price?  Who gets to handle the faucet?  Is anyone guaranteed water?  Does life necessity factor in to this?  How does voluntarysm impact something like life necessities.

IDK, forgive me and my first world Christmas party existential thoughts, but if you have any answers I'd like to know.
