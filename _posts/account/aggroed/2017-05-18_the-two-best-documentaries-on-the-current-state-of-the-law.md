So, I owe a huge part of my awakening to a simple movie called "Ungrip."  I don't remember the name of the internet friend that suggested that I go watch it, but the fellow owned a place in NH, had guns, owned his own smoke shop, and stock piled silver and gold with his extra cash.  He was cool as hell and I think he was ex-military.  So, anyway, I figured, what could go wrong?  It's just a movie!

Little did I know that just by asking a few really simple questions of the legal system things start falling apart.  It feels to me like there are so many little transparencies that are stacked on top of what is real.  It becomes very difficult to tell what is real and what is not.  What laws apply to me?  Which laws are "Pretend Laws" (yes that's a thing)?  So, a great starting point to gently slide your way down the rabbit hole is this incredible documentary called Ungrip.  It follows the path of a gentle Canadian as he tries to figure out how to unhook himself from aspects of control that didn't suit him.

The second movie I'd suggest is this odd little Australian flick called "What the FUQ: Frequently unanswered questions."  After reading a bunch of material (much of it comes from Anna Von Reitz- http://annavonreitz.com/) I slowly came to terms with the fact that what I think of as "The Government" is actually a private corporation that's been in existance since 1871 masquerading as a public government when it's actually a private government services corporation.  That's a lot to mentally and emotionally take in.  So, I like this story because it's just a guy trying to import a car.  Nothing outrageous, but during that journey he discovers that the government he's dealing with is actually a corporation and how he can respond to it.

It's 3 hours of your life that can help you understand the nature of your surroundings in very plain and easy to understand English.  You'll probably hate me at first if you haven't gone down this path at all, but about a year from now you can thank me then.
