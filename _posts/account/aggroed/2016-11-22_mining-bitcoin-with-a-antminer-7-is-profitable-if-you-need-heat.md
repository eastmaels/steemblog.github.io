<p>Here's the first mining rig I bought. &nbsp;It's an antminer 7-ln. &nbsp;The thing draws 740 watts at my wall. &nbsp;It has a hashrate of 2.7TH/s, which pays be somewhere around .0032-0.0036 btc/day. &nbsp;It's about $2.50 a day right now. &nbsp;I live in New England and my electricity is pretty expensive at $0.19/KWh. &nbsp;So, running it costs me .74x24x.19= $3.37/day.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now a sane person would look at that and say "Hey dipshit. &nbsp;You're losing money!" &nbsp;That's true, but as it turns out I blog from my office in my attic, which is unheated. &nbsp;I need to run a space heater. &nbsp;The space heater uses about 640 watts. &nbsp;If I can replace my spaceheater with this antminer, which I did, and keep the place warm enough to not feel like a water protector getting hosed down in sub zero temperature by the amazing violent and truly unamerican North Dakota state police acting as militarized oil contractors then it's a good deal. &nbsp;Effectively, it's costs me 100 watts to make bitcoin and I would have used the other 600 watts anyways, but it would have just cost me money rather than make me some too.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So, while overall I'm down on money for this thing because I need the heat I think of it like a thing that costs 100 watts or something that costs me $0.45 to make $2.50. &nbsp;So, at least for the winter it's a good deal. &nbsp;I don't think I would use more than one, but I'm glad I have this thing chugging away.</p>
<p>I have the proceeds going going to steem right now. &nbsp;So, I can also put that investment in the entertainment category.</p>
