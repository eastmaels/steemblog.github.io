20 years ago I was a Democrat and I believed the lie that the United States got involved in other countries for humanitarian reasons.  I also believed that the United States was a force for good in the world, and that we were actually a city on a hill.  We had something amazing to offer the world and had a rightful place to share our greatness.

Today is a much different story.  I haven't lost my progressive values.  I still think that everyone deserves a place to live, food in their belly, and peace in the world.  Now however I think that government is the last place to look for it.  

## Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

What's the single most important historic event in the history of the modern world and how does it impact us today?  I would say that the event is the Bretton Woods Accords following World War II.  Out of that meeting the US dollar was accepted as the world reserve currency.  It meant that everyone in every country had to accept dollars.  What you may not understand is just how much power lives in that ability.  We print money.  They have to give us resources for it.  Before the 70s that power was restrained by the Gold Standard, but that's not longer the case.  Nixon nixxed it.  Now we have fiat money.

You used to be able to walk into a bank and give them money and they would give you gold.  Now they would give you crazy looks or think you're a bank robber if you asked for it.  

## What does that do to the world reserve currency?

It means there are no more limitations regarding how much money the US Fed can print.  A good example is when back in 2008 during the "financial crisis" banks printed [$16 Trillion USD](https://www.forbes.com/sites/traceygreenstein/2011/09/20/the-feds-16-trillion-bailouts-under-reported/#6a28a3ef26b0).  I believe that number is even higher.   Who did it go to?  Mostly foreign owned banks.  They said it was to save the economy, but really it was a massive cash grab by criminal banksters.  To put it in context the USD GDP, the combined income of every American and Corporation in the US is roughly $16T.  That's how much they printed.

The whole country worked for a year day and night to produce goods and services to generate that much revenue.  The bank bought paper and printed cash or just clicked some numbers on a screen and VOILA!  $16T.  Not only that but they devalued all the money in everyone's account.  When inflation is high the purchasing power goes down.  When they print more money in a day than the country generates in a year that counts as "high inflation."

## What would you do to maintain your ability to print $16T in a single day?

I'm not arguing that oil isn't an important factor, but oil and gas as an industry is roughly a $2T market annually.  That's 1/8 of what they printed in a day.  The fed's been around since 1913.  Who knows how much they have printed behind the backs of Americans.  I'm betting it's much more than $16T.  Anyway, the point isn't that Oil and Gas doesn't mean shit in the world stage, but that there's practically no limit to what the Deep State will do to preserve their ability to print money on demand whenever they want it.

Gaddafi in Libya, Saddam in Iraq, and now Assad in Syria all have one major thing in common.  They were dropping the US dollar and then found themselves invaded.  When you understand the importance of owning the printing press for the world reserve currency than you have a better understanding of just how much is at stake.

## China and Russia are dropping the dollar in their trade

And now we're seeing a lot of World War III rattlings.  Yeah, those rattlings are also to divert attention from the inhuman crimes that the Deep State commits and is getting exposed for, but if war actually breaks out then the main purpose is to maintain the ability to print dollars and force the rest of the world to accept them.

I put magical ink on paper, and you give me oil.
I put magical ink on paper, and you work in this factory for a year.
I put magical ink on paper, and you build weapons for me.

There's nothing more powerful in the world right now than the ability to print money at whim that the entire world accepts.

##  These wars aren't just about oil.  They are about holding onto the World Reserve Currency
