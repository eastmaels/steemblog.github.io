Ok, well, for readers and friends you know I've had a funky 2 week experience.  Uncle died, a separate argument with my spouse ensued, was issued a polite invitation to leave my house, resolved that a few days later (we seem to go through that every couple of years), went to Florida for a meetup, and now I'm back.

Time to get to work.  I have some household and daily tasks to accomplish including fixing my car, getting my work-outs in, talking to a company my family invested in to potentially lend them some time to help them get up and running, getting a back log of posts out (I did a Boston meetup and never posted... couple of shows, some projects).  I have to get caught up on Steem Monsters and see when various stages of that is ready to go.  

I think I need to include continuous improvement of my marriage in the main list.  We've had a rough go of things.  I don't think I'm the lone truther, or sole person who struggled with family death (only 2 of the 11 people in the two generations above mine still live) who has had this experience.  Toss in some overextended use of alcohol and some financial roller coasters and it's been a hell of a decade.  Things seem to be mending between my wife and I, but it's going to take work and effort.  Gonna explore if it's time to prioritize this some.

There's a lot to do.  I suppose there's a lot of DMs to work through too.  If you've sent me requests and I didn't get to them in the last week or two I'm sorry.  I'm feeling fairly recharged and am looking forward to getting shit done again.  If we're all lucky we can couple that with some big BTC price movements, which should impact Steem and SBD as well, and we'll be sitting pretty very soon.

Thank you for your patience.  It's time to get back to work!
