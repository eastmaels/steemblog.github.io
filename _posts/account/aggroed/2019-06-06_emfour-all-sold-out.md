Well, that didn't take long.  4 days ago I posted this story https://steemit.com/steem-engine/@aggroed/steem-engine-mining-enabled-for-eng-tokens.  It was announcing that Steem-engine.com would now have a mining pool.  100k ENG/yr.  The community responded by purchasing $100k worth of miners in 4 days.  EMFOUR is now sold out.

Good news is you can still get [EM](https://steem-engine.com/?p=market&t=EM), but the bad news is that it's not quite as efficient as the EMFOUR.

## Test Case

One reason to do this was to sell miners.  The bigger reason to do this was to show the potential of delegated proof of stake digital mining.  

**token a mines token b**

This is a powerful tool and concept.  It's customizable.  It's environmentally sustainable.  You don't need a masters in computer science to make it work.  And it's dishwasher safe!

## If you missed out on the EMFOUR there's already another miner out there

PALMM is the miner that you can use to get PALcoin.  I've been enjoying receiving PALcoin every hour considering I already own a fair amount of the mining tokens out there.
