So, a critical part of building a good plan is correctly identifying the stakeholders involved and sussing out their needs.  I plan on submitting a Proposal to Steem Alliance called "Stars Align." Honestly, I should shut my face so I can win and keep some of this stuff to myself.  That said, I'd rather lose to better competition than win because there isn't any good stuff.  My hope is that my ideas are the strongest, but if there really is a better solution out there I'm gonna support it cause what I really want to see is Steem going mainstream.

So, here I am... helping people that are gonna compete with me.  I hope you guys can use these stakeholder designs and have it inspire something awesome.  Anyway, here goes!

## Stake Holders

Here's some of the Stake Holders I think I've identified.  I have a brief description of their Haves and Wants.  I guess my advice to other teams making proposals is this: if you want your idea to get broad acceptance try to find the maximum overlap of Wants and Haves.
