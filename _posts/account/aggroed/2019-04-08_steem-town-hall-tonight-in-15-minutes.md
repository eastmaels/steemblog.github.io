I missed my show last night travelling back from PA where Matt and I got a chance to meet Charlie Lee from Litecoin!  Tonight though I'm back normally and will be joined by cohost @llfarms.

We have a number of things to discuss on air and hope you'll be able to join us.  Should be some really neat pieces of info tonight you won't want to miss!
