So, first just want to give a quick shout out to my witness supporters.  Today I hit 1200 Witness votes.  4 months ago I was barely noticed on the platform.  Today I'm a top 20 Witness.  If you're a minnow around here wondering if it's possible I feel like pretty good proof that it is.  @slowwalker is the lastest whale to support my campaign and I'm very grateful.  It's been basicly a non-stop ride of work and effort since I started the Minnow Support Project a little under three months ago, but it's been insanely rewarding!  I have a ton of people I legit love and respect.  Friends on every continent.  A radioshow, a streaming radio station, an army of community and curation bots, and a a few dozen people that I've delegated some steem too.  So far it's been a great ride and I'm incredibly grateful and continuing to put in many hours each week.

We're also about to get on the Steemit welcome page.  it's a big deal!!!  With signups fixed we're gonna really get a lot of new users, and if they all visit in MSP this place is gonna get YUUGEE.

Anyway, it's not surprising that my 1200 witness votes and my meet your mod post are linked.  The votes follow the work I do for the platform every day.  One of those jobs is spotlighting the moderators that help make MSP an awesome community.  So, I'd like to showcase one now!

## @discordiant

When did you hear about the MSP?
## @discordiant- Less than 24 hours after my account was approved. A nice couple of people in steemit.chat were kind enough to point out the communities I might enjoy more.

Why did you join the MSP?
## @discordiant- Because I was told to check out some alternatives to Steemit.Chat, since it can be rough to really find a community there. They were awesome from the first second I was there, so I just stuck around.

What do you think is the best aspect of the MSP?
## @discordiant- Community. Full stop. It came to me yesterday, that I have never heard of a place where 5000 people, from literally everywhere, can come together in this kind of community.

You're a moderator what does that mean to you?
## @discordiant- More work, but being able to help shape the foundations of the community, and keep it from imploding from the sudden growth.

All the moderators have service projects.  What's your service project?
## @discordiant- (hashtag) meetup channel - A place where people can start local get-togethers of all sizes, safely and easily

how much time do you spend on MSP stuff?
## @discordiant-More than is healthy, probably. I am on Discord most of my waking day. I try and make something to help the minnows in one form or another every day.

Why does it matter to you so much?
## @discordiant- I have never found a community so worthy of my time on the internet before this. 

We need some channel mods, why should people do it?
## @discordiant- So that I can get back to posting, and earning, on Steemit. The time I spend sweeping through the channels on Discord is time that I am not growing my audience or following. I wouldn't trade my Moderator-ship for anything, but it would be nice to be able to post again.

What excites you about Steemit?
## @discordiant- Steemit, and blockchain tech in general reminds me of that feeling I got when email first became a thing, when Google was formed, all those things I remember being there at the start of. It's amazing.

What's a long term vision for where Steemit is going?and how do you fit into that?
## @discordiant- I can see Steemit and any of it's successors being a place to show the internet what open communities should be like. If more of Steemit were like MSP, it would already be a name to rival Facebook.

What can MSP be doing better?  
## @discordiant- Not much needs to added here. If more people would realize that the bots are a reason to get people to join, but not the real reason to stay here, they would earn more over-all.

How can minnows contribute to the system and grow their accounts?
## @discordiant- Delegate, make sure you only upvote the quality posts, and try and make sure all of their own posts are worth an upvote.

What else would you want to share here?
## @discordiant- The more you (@aggroed) can do to lighten the load on the Moderators will allow us to solve more problems together.

Funny story.  @discordiant decided one day to prune the list of inactives from the Minnow Support roster.  So, we lost 880 accounts in one day.  I was cranky about it because I literally posted like 2 days prior that we hit 5,000 accounts.  Anyway, once it happened I asked him to do it every week and also write a report of banned, kicked, and muted members for transparency and make a route back in.  He has a post now where he's basically the police blotter for us sharing which asshat is attempting to scam our accounts and how many post-pormoters we've banned for spamming lion pics in 40 unrelated channels.

Our list of services coming out of the minnow pond are growing every week!  Thanks for helping make that possible @discordiant!
