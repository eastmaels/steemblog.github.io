<p>The presidential debate was a spectacular show clearly demonstrating the best characteristics of American politicians and the mainstream media's approach to debate moderation. &nbsp;In a clear display of normalcy 20% of the debate was dedicated to an incredibly important national issue: Obama's birth certificate. &nbsp;The layers of details, the intrigue, and the vast international implications of Obama's origins near the end of his second term will have an extremely potent impact on the world stage in the years to come. &nbsp;Additionally another 15% of debate was around Trump's undisclosed tax return. &nbsp;Again, no reader could possibly underestimate the importance of such a document while working to shred Obamacare.</p>
<p>An interesting side note appeared during the debate where former Governor and former Democratic presidential candidate shared his thoughts that Trump might be a coke user in a tweet. &nbsp;This isn't just your normal crackhead on the internet. &nbsp;This is a medical doctor that's questioning/insinuating Trump's drug abuse.</p>

<p>Dean took some initial heat for the comment, but defended the remarks.</p>

<p>In a bizarre twist to this story when asked directly about it Trump spokesman Norm Whitey shared "Trump used to snort coke." &nbsp;After a short pause he added "Well, he still does, but he used to too! &nbsp;BOOM see what I did?!?" &nbsp;The spokesman then started dancing with moves not seen since Michael Jackson hay days suggesting to many that he too was snorting coke.</p>
<p>"Whew! &nbsp;This interview is awesome! &nbsp;Trump's AWESOME! &nbsp;Vote TRUMP! &nbsp;Make America Great Again." &nbsp;He was very excited "But it's crashing kinda early. &nbsp;Also, I gotta run and see Uncle Joe soon before Elvis leaves the building. &nbsp;We don't want The Donald crashing too hard after the debate performance he'll get the shivers." Whitey shared before hastily exiting the interview.</p>

<p>Joe Biden, aka, Uncle Joe, was not available for questions, but this investigation seems be confirming what many Americans knew about him all along.</p>
