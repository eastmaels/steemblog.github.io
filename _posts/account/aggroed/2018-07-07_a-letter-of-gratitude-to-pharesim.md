Since I’ve been here pharesim has been in the top 20 witnesses.  He’s a whale and a Dev and it makes him a good potential candidate.  What I think has helped him excel is his kindness and generosity.  Since the very early days of Minnowsupport he has followed our votes and helped spread just a little bit more cheer to 1500 minnows every day.  This is a very selfless act.  He could be raking in rewards with a big bidbot all to himself, but instead he basically chooses to forego helping himself to help the many.

Someday we all have to realize that in the pursuit of wealth we either live in an endless wheel of always wanting more or staking a flag in the ground, saying we have enough, and helping other people.  Pharesim is one of several whales to do that and one of several witnesses to do that.  There are not too many examples of whale witnesses that approach it this way.

So for your help along the way I say thank you.  For keeping the chain going I say thank you.  For building apps and spreading steem I say thank you.  For spreading your rewards to many I say thank you.

It’s been an honor to serve along side of you, I’ve seen your approach of giving, I have received and will pay it forward, and as you retire your witness I’ll be one of many to keep building this beautiful chain.

Namaste brother Pharesim and thank you for your work, your time, your approach, and your kindness.
