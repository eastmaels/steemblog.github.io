The Steem blockchain operates with a delegated proof of stake model.  People who have staked steem can elect witnesses who are able to implement changes to the code.  Today I'm hosting a Forum with the Witnesses, usually consisting of 4-6 top 20 witnesses and a backup witness or two, to talk about the Steem ecosystem.  

Right now we have a variety of challenges making our way through the bear market.  This is an opportunity to discuss them and use that to open dialog.

Please come join us.  We'll be in the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Discord Channel](minnowpond.org) at 10am est/ 1500 UTC.  Hope to see you there
