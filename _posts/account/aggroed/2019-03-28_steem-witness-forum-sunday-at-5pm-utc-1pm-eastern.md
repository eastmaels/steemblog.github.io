![Witness Forum.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmaRdp7k9ww6ZErWXZ4RrFfLpBDBxLoJHwDc77xW9jGsim/Witness%20Forum.png)

It's the last weekend of the month, so that means it's time to host another witness forum!  @elipowell is scheduled to join us from Steemit so we'll hear a little progress from there.

Other top 20 witnesses are welcome to join and talk about what they think is important on the platform these days and projects they are working on or want to bring awareness too.

I'll welcome 1-2 backup witnesses as well to share what they are working in as we build rather than hibernate through the long crypto winter.

## Logistics

Join us in the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel](https://minnowpond.org).

Show starts at 1pm Eastern.  5 PM UTC.

If you're planning on speaking please arrive slightly early so that we can test your audio.  

If you'd like to listen, but not participate audio is usually better in mspwaves.com/listen.
