Ok, timing the bottom is hard.  This might be it, it might not be.  This could go on for a year.  We could be back up in a week.  The fact remains that this is some cheap ass steem.  So, two things about that.  Some whales are dumping.  That's great.  We can make a better distribution on the platform and get a middle class going.  It's also a great chance for you to have and grow an account here.  So, take the dive, buy some Steem, and I bet a year from now you'll be thrilled you did.

It's impossible to know your exact financial situation.  So, don't spend money you can't afford to lose.  I'm not a guy who can give you financial advice.  I don't know your financial situation. I can just share that I'm happy to pick up more steem when the price is low and looking forward to selling it when the price is high.

There's blood in the streets and capitulation appears to be ongoing.  Consider a ladder buy in and join the ranks of the dolphin class.
