Hold on!  There's no mechanism in Steemit that let's you get paid just for reading!  How can reading a post earn me anything?


## I'm glad you asked! <h2>
Your goal as an author is provide a service to your audience.  The service has multiple parts.
1.  You provide entertainment, which is one of the most heavily valued services in the world!
2.  You provide information.  You are relating something someone ought to know, but doesn't, and won't learn it unless you share it with them.
3.  You provide a unique perspective.  Your stories in your voice with your character are truly unique.  Hearing a similar story from you with that vantage can inform my own life.

## Reading good stories helps you provide those services <h2>
So, go ahead and read some blog posts that are making traction.  Some of the posts that make traction are trash being upvoted by bots and friends, some are probably too technical for you to follow in their foot steps, and some are really great pieces of writing that can help and inspire you.  Learn from what good steemers are doing so you can find ways to riff off of their success.  Hell, the style of this post is straight based of authors on here who I learned from  (looking at you @kaylinart).

## Learn what your audience cares about <h2>
When you write your story try to think about who the audience member is that you're appealing too.  If you have to imagine what they are like you may not actually know much about who is following you.  Go lurk on some followers feeds and see what interests them.  You may want to spend extra time looking at who has a lot of Steem Power in your followers and cater to them somewhat.  True, it's kinda selling out if you're tweaking your posts to cater to wealth, but if the message aligns with the wallets then you're just monetizing the message you stand for.  That's just good business and Steem in many ways can act like a business.

## Summary <h2>
Go read!  Read the best posts.  Read your followers posts.  Read the wall of people that you want to follow you.  Find overlap, improve your writing, and get 'Riggity rich son!'
