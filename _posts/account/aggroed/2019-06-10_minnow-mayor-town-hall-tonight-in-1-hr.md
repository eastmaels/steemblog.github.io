So, lots of stuff to talk about.  We have a hard fork for steem coming up, splintertalk.io was released, palnet.io, claimdrop for palcoin, tournament updates for Splinterlands, and I'm sure there's stuff I'm forgetting.  Should be a good time!

minnowpond.org for the discord
mspwaves.com/listen for audio only

Check for a vimm stream too.

Justine may not make it tonight so I'm hoping someone will cohost with me tonight!
