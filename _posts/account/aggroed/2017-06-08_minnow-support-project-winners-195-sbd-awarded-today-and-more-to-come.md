Hello Minnows!
I recently hit 1,340 followers and broke into the top 90 authors on Steemit. It had a lot to do with @kaylinart and @fyrstikken resteeming one of my posts. 
it got me thinking...

What if I could help my followers like @kaylinart and @fyrstikken helped me!?! It's pretty easy to do. All I have to do is resteem my followers! What if I could get them a reward too!?!  And the Minnow Support Project was born!

## What are the rules? <h2>
People link on Monday's, and the award goes out on Thursdays.  This is the rewaads post.

## What counts as a minnow? <h2>
If you have less than 500 followers and have earned less than 5,000SP at the time you post then you're a minnow that's eligible for the resteem and the reward!
