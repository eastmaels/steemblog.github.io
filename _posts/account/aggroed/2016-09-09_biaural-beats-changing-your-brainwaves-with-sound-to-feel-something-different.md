<p>Biaural beats are a way to relax or amp your brain with sound. &nbsp;You need a headset or some earbuds, a quiet place to lie down, and a plan to do absolutely nothing while you're listening to them.</p>
<p>The music is played at two different frequencies. &nbsp;If you're a stringed instrument musician you may recognize the way the sound is made. &nbsp;As you are tuning your strings when they start getting close to the same vibration you can hear the ringing as the instrument is out of tune. &nbsp;A finely trained ear or an easily purchased app brings the two notes to the exact frequency so the ringing of the two strings out of sync is inaudible. &nbsp;In biaural beats the whole point is to make that ringing happen and do it at a specific frequency.</p>
<p>The process of what you're doing is called <strong>entrainment</strong>. &nbsp;These sounds maintain a constant range and as you relax/meditate to them they will pull your brain into that wavelength. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are 5 main ranges that one targets when they are purposely creating the<a href="http://binauralbrains.com/brainwave-frequencies/"> different frequencies</a> and they each correlate to a different state of mind.</p>
<p><a href="http://binauralbrains.com/gamma-binaural-beats/">Gamma</a>, 30-50 Hz- &nbsp;Wanna fake it like a Tibetan monk? &nbsp;If you're aiming for Nirvana then this range is for you. &nbsp;While most humans won't reach this level of frequency it's thought of as a state of heightened awareness reserved for reiki masters and qi gong experts. &nbsp;Maybe you haven't trained your brain to get here the standard way, but for some people this type of music can help them touch a higher level of consciousness filled with love and harmony. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Beta, 14-30 Hz- The Betas are your normal consciousness. &nbsp;When you're awake and moving and stressed and working you're probably emitting Betas. &nbsp;If you're feeling extremely lathargic and have to get to people land this might be a good fit. &nbsp;Mostly though the songs start here to start entraining your brain to a controlled frequency and then they move them into the other bands.</p>

<p>Alpha, 8-14 Hz Looking for focus? &nbsp;Want to be in the zone? &nbsp;Have a paper that you have to crank out by 8am tomorrow and need the focus to do it? &nbsp;Look no further because Alpha waves have you covered. &nbsp;These suckers get you focused, intent, and ready to work.</p>

<p>Theta, 4-8 Hz- &nbsp;When you're actively dreaming your brain is in the Theta range. &nbsp;If you are short a half gram of DMT and aren't interested in schedule 1s you may consider sending your brain down this roller coaster. &nbsp;You may experience lucid dreams or just go on a serious day dream. &nbsp;If you're looking for a tough solution, getting over writers block, or accessing your creative side these are the sounds for you.</p>

<p>Delta, 0.1-4 Hz- These are the slowest of the series. &nbsp;Your brain gives off Delta waves when you're sleeping. &nbsp;So going through the process of listening to Biaural Beats at this calm you down like a good dose of downers. &nbsp;It's a good way to sleep, to relax, and to enter deep space.</p>

<p>There are lots of places on the web to dig this music up. &nbsp;If you're feeling stuck in life here's a quick way to get a boost!</p>
