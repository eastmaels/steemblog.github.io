So, my three main values are Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  I'm interested in educating people and building community.  I want this world to change and in the end you have to be the change you want to be.

## So, here's a first pass <h2>

I'm formally creating a new Discord group called The Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network (I learned a lesson from @fyrstikken who has built a phenominal steemspeak channel).  I'll just call the group "PALnet," and the folks that are a part of it are PALs.  Here's the link to the channel.  I'll work on graphics and stuff next.  We'll use the tag PAL for general posts and palnet for community posts.

## The purpose of the group <h2>
PALnet is meant to help people seeking peace, abundance, and liberty in the world.  We can do that by spreading a positive vision for the future, a constructive discourse about problems of today, and how we might work collaboratively to change things.

The group is just now starting so it's a great time to join us.  If you're creating this kind of content and hoping for an upvote or resteem or are just interested in world views a little contrarian to the mainstream it's a great place to hang out.  I'm expecting a handful of whales with an interest in the topic to support us, so please consider joining us!
