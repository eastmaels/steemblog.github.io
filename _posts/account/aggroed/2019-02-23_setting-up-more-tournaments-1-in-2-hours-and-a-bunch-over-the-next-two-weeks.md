Don't mind me.  Just setting up some automated tournaments for tonight, tomorrow, and a couple weeks out.  I need these images in a common spot to help me facilitate that though.  Look for some news coming out on @steemmonsters.com.

First new tournament- Gold League.  Starts in 1 hour and 45 min.  Come join us.  I'll be streaming and if you stream I'll give you some free boosters.
