https://agx123.herokuapp.com//2018-02-16.jpg<br/><br/>This is the daily AgX chart for today 2018-02-16.<br/>Today's 200 Day moving average is 0.94 for a STEEM/SBD ratio of 0.8.<h3>What is AgX?</h3><br/><br/>The Mayer's multiple (200 days moving average of the BTC/USD price) is known to be a good indicator of the BTC price evolution.
AgX aims to be a similar indicator regarding the STEEM/SBD ratio, in order for users to find the right moment to exchange their SBD for STEEM at the best possible rate.

When the blue line is at the top of the graph that's a historically good time to sell steem and buy sbd.  When it's at the bottom of the graph that's a good time to sell sbd and buy steem.   When the blue line is near the red line or in the middle of the graph it's hard to know what to do.

I'm going to move this off my wall in a week or so and put it on @agx.
