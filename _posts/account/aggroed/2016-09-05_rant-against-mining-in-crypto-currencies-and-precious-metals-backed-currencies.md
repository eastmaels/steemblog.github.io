Everyone knows and loves Bitcoin. &nbsp;Well, maybe not everyone. &nbsp;Some conspiracy theorists out there think it's a way to move everyone to cashless society where every single transaction is monitored by the controllers. &nbsp;@matrixdweller did a post on this yesterday! &nbsp;Welcome to the party bud!</p>
<p>Leaving that aside for a little bit my real beef with cryptos that have mining is that they are inherently undemocratic. &nbsp;Ok, so the first guys that screw around with it can use real simple computers and get a few coin. &nbsp;As the process is harder you need more serious hardware to crank out the code to get your coin. &nbsp;By the end you have server farms running day and night mining bitcoin.</p>

<p>Do you know who can afford to run bitcoin mining operations in third world countries? &nbsp;Rich people. &nbsp;That's it. &nbsp;I get it. You're a nerd and your nerd bro can buy some mining hardware and crank out code too, but what are you going to do in your basement compared to banks that invest in buildings full of servers.</p>
<p>So, the only way to get a substantial amount of Bitcoin without doing labor or selling goods for it is to be rich or to be the creator, but let's face it, that kid probably had a phenomenal background and a host of private schools as a backdrop to be able to build a program like that... so to be that creator you probably had to come from wealth.</p>
<p>Ok, well downer Aggroed, what should we do instead. &nbsp;Your first guess is "We need a gold backed currency." &nbsp;Hold up there too genius. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Who has money to have gold? &nbsp;Rich people. &nbsp;We have a shitty fiat currency backed by the US military, and secondarily backed by the petro dollar, which at the moment seems to be going to shit. &nbsp;The two alternatives that are presented seem to be bitcoin and gold backed currencies. &nbsp;The current wealthy class wins in both of those scenarios.</p>
<p>So, what do I propose. &nbsp;People are the real value. &nbsp;You can't eat gold. &nbsp;If there was a planet made of gold but no one to get it or trade it there would be no perceived value to it. &nbsp;The only real thing of value is life. &nbsp;Your soul. &nbsp;Your labor. &nbsp;Animals. &nbsp;Their flesh and their labor. &nbsp;That's actual wealth.</p>
<p>So, I propose this. &nbsp;Issue currency from a central bank to people. &nbsp;The loan is interest free but the money decays over a finite lifespan so as to not lead to infinite inflation. &nbsp;All people earn the exact same amount for being a living human. &nbsp;Then you can use that currency to live a modest life or earn more by all the normal shit one does in an economy.</p>
<p>I have a basic working model of it. &nbsp;I call it <a href="palcoin.org">PALCoin</a>. &nbsp;It stands for peace, abundance, liberty, and Pal of course means friend. &nbsp;Don't bother telling me it's not a beautiful website or the most robust software ever. &nbsp;I know, I built the whole thing for under $300. &nbsp;That said, when the time is right and I'm actually prepared for it I could launch an all digital fiat backed currency that doesn't require mining and doesn't keep the rich as the rich.</p>
<p>Rant over. &nbsp;You may now go back your regularly scheduled gold vs cryto debates.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Oh, and this goes for you too STEEMIT. &nbsp;People are the value.</p>
