If you haven't noticed I touch upon some pretty touchy subjects while blogging.  I've toned it down a little bit now that I'm running for witness, but  only because my focus is on the start of the campaign.  When that's a little more mature I can let is sit more in the background and focus again on helping to spread my values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  Those three values I think of when I'm trying to envision a new system and when I'm trying to explain what's wrong with the current one.

## The perfect quote for battling the old systems <h2>

I've stated in some previous posts that my current approach is straight talkin' funnyman.  I use Jon Stewart and Colbert as models for what that can look like.  I think they are funny sometimes, but I also don't like how they try to keep the peace and your attitude focused between Dem and Rep.  That's a false choice.  The real choice is between statism and liberty.  So, they can be funny and they use that funny to hit some tough topics.  I try to do that in my blogging.  I think that's why I like the series of "still more believable than" for 9/11.  Some might call it callous, but it's trying to breach the topic in a funny way.

## The one I look to for the future though is this incredible quote by Buckminster!  <h2>

https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2F736x%2F9a%2Fe7%2F92%2F9ae792bca49d9c4ca9961f77b8718c89.jpg&f=1

I fell in love with that quote the first time I saw it.  I heard about it while networking with some other occupy protestors.  It made my current actions feel insignificant.  I know that raising awareness is a good thing, and because of occupy I can say "the 1%" and this whole country knows what I'm talking about.  The challenge though was that simply talking about that wasn't going to fix it.  You have to do action.

I'm moving money to steemit.  I'm taking cash out of my savings account and putting it here.  I don't believe you can change it from the inside.  Apply that to the Nazis.  Apply that to Stalin.  Apply that pedogate.  It doesn't work.  I think the real option is to withdraw your consent to systems in place and stop giving them your power, participation and energy.  The challenge though is that I don't want to give up things.

I don't want to stop being on the grid.  I want to stop being on their grid.
I don't want to stop using internet.  I want to stop using their heavily patrolled internet.
I don't want to stop using currency.  I want to stop using their currency (which they print as debt so it can never be paid back).

So, part of why I'm such an advocate for this place is that it allows me a convenient way to replace what I was doing.  For that I'm really grateful to steemit.  Going to keep working on growing this place.  Let's see what else we can replace as a community.
