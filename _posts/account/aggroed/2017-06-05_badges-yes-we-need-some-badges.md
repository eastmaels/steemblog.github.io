Badges are social proof.  They can be informative.  They can be prizes.  They can be beautiful.  @elyaque was kind enough to help out on a series of Minnow Support Project Badges.

Still deciding, but these are awesome.  Maybe I'll rotate :)  I'm a scientist so I think I'll end up going with the scientist, but the name aggroed comes from my time playing WOW as an orc warrior.  Tough call.

@elyaque says he'll make YOU one too if you message him on steemit chat.  He didn't want my money, but I already follow him for his market updates and I have him on my steemvoter too so I'm always supporting his financial series he writes.

If you are looking for his original badges he's compiled them all here: https://steemit.com/steemit/@elyaque/free-steemit-badges-overview
