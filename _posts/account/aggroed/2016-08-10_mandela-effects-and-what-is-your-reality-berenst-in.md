<p>Look.  You're going to have to forgive ME.  I'm big into Mandela Effects (often abbreviated as MEs).  There are lot of theories of what causes MEs.  None are proven, and all are really hard to prove.  So, what is a ME?  It's when there is a difference between what a group of people remember and what recorded history says is true.  Let's start out with one of the one's that blows people's minds.  You only have to take 1 second to fill in the blank-</p>
<p>Name the family of bears from the series-  </p>

<p>a.  Berenstein</p>
<p>b.  Berenstain</p>
<p>c.  Berenston</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That's it.  You like 90% of the people that I've <a href="http://goo.gl/EhPW8U" rel="noopener">polled </a>probably think that the answer is &quot;a.&quot;  You'd be wrong.  Very wrong.  The thing that astonishes most people is that the answer is &quot;b.&quot;  Take a second.  Go goggle it.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It didn't change.  It's always been that way.  The family claims that they haven't changed their name and it's been that way long before the books came out.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This is the Mandela Effect.  People remember something different than what reality checks in as.  Now, here's where it gets weird.  I know that when I was growing up that it was Berenstein.  It's what rolls off the tongue.  Part of my family is Jewish.  Stein is a common suffix to a jewish last name.  I thought the existence of a family of Jewish bears was funny.  I remember talking about this with friends and family.  I never would have done that for a Stain as it's not a common Jewish ending.  Hopefully you remember this book and series growing up.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What does it mean to you that google records them and history records them as the Berenstain Bears?</p>
