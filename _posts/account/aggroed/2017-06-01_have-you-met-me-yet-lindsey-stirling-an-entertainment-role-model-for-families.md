Lindsey Stirling is a dancing violinist, movie producer, world tourer, and one of the best role models in entertainment I can find for my kids.

## She got her start on America's Got Talent <h2>
Technically, she got her start when her parents enforced violin lessons over and over, but her big break came when she went on America's got talent.

## a few reasons I like her <h2>
1.  She's actually very talented as opposed to just using autotuned nonsense
2.  She's technically inclined and does the video editing to make many of her videos
3.  She isn't a disney princess or a skantly clad idiot.

## My favorite song is Elements <h2>

Look at the costumes she designs and wears.  They are classy and beautiful and avoid going slutty.

## I watch Lindsey with my daughters <h2>
As a parent it's hard to find content that I like.  It's all helpless princesses and mean pirates for a lot of the shows.  And the shows exploit kids.  Seems like there are a lot of mkultra victims and project monarch victims that get tossed into the mix.

I like how I can sit back, watch my kids have their imagination going through the roof, start dancing, want to play the violin, and just be really grateful for what she created.
