This was a fun show.  My normal cohost @isaria couldn't attend so I invited @zipporah, @clayboynn, and @globocop onto the show to discuss an abundance mindset, some history of Steem, flagging, and bid bots.  It's a good episode and even has a little interpersonal drama as we discuss some folks that are currently flagging us... good times!
