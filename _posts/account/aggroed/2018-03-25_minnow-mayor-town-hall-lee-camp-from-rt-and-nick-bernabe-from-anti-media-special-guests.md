Time for another Red Pill.  Should be a fun show tonight.  Looking like Lee Camp from Russia Today will come on around 9pm EST and Nick Bernabe from Anti-Media will join at the same time or after.  We might get a little into the Red Pill weeds this evening.  I'm looking forward to it.  I'm not positive but I believe @suzi3d will be there as well.  Honestly it would be tough to get you a bigger Red Pill than this unless a white hat military insider landed in my lap this evening.

Anyway,  I founded this thing called the Minnow Support Project to help new community members.  I needed a Discord so I founded the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Discord Group](minnowpond.org).  It's up to 16,000 Steemians in there.  Alright, so we wanted to get the word out.  So I founded a radio station called MSP-Waves to get the word out, and put together a Show called the Minnow Mayor Town Hall.

## Logistics! <h2>

Show will happen in Discord.  It's also rebroadcast onto mspwaves.com/listen.

Show starts at 9m after @isaria showcases some musical talent from around the Steem ecosystem.

Show is open to anyone after the guests come on.  

## Rules <h2>

You can say whatever you want and express any thought or opinion.  Just don't be a dick while doing it to me, the guests, or other audience members.

If you post random links during my show that doesn't have anything to do with the show you'll get booted and laughed at.

## Guests and people that want to go on air should hang out in the waiting room channel. 

Be sure to have a working mic and a headphone set.
