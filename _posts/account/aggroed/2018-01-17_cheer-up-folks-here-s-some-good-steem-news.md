Let's do a little throwback Thursday.  For just a moment pause, take the gun off your temple.  No, don't put it in your mouth.  Do you even know where that's been?  It tastes metallic, rusty, and you probably need some disinfectant now.  Honestly, we're gonna be ok.

I know I know. You and lots of people didn't sell at the highs and now you're seeing a sea of red.  if you have some cash this is probably an amazing opportunity to buy in.  Tell your friends to join crypto and be sure to remind them to sell when we're mooning.  Also tell them they owe you for the good fucking advice!

## Good News 1 <h2>

Back to the throw back.  Check out this chart.

Remember all the way back in November?  BTC was around 11k like it is now.  What was the price?  92 cents.  One of the things that gives me light and hope is the fact that the market is placing a higher value on Steem than it has previously.  At the time I'm writing this the price is $3.41.  Now, yes technically that blows compared to highs in the 9s, but that was so last fortnight.  This week we're dealing with 11k btc, some 10k btc, and a little turd of a 9k btc.  But right now we're at $3.41.  That's 3.7X gain in 2 months.  That's pretty spectacular.  So, even if you missed the high highs you're sitting way prettier than you were 2 months ago.

## More good news! <h2>

Steem blew past the previous record for most transactions in a day and is now holding the world record at 1,660,739.  That's amazing.  We're amazing.  

HIGH FIVE!

Also note that the "Dan coins" using DPoS are rocking capacities of under 1% while the most active competitors out there are over capacity and have transactions waiting.

## Corrections happen, they tend to happen in January <h2>

If you don't read @penguinpablo you really ought to.  [Here's](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@penguinpablo/since-2015-bitcoin-s-low-of-the-year-was-always-in-mid-january) his most recent post where he talks about Cryptos having their low annually around mid January.  Here's hoping we've made it through it this year and this is the low point.  Mid $3s for Steem and SBD as a low sounds like a great fucking 2018.

## So, relax, smoke some weed where appropriate, have sex, rub one out, watch Netflix <h2>

It's gonna be ok.  We're all gonna be ok.  You're standing on the precipice of an incredible year and it's gonna be great.  Now excuse me while I go talk this guy down.
