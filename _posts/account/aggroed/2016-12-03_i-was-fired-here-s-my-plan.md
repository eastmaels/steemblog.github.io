<p>So, I was fired from work on Thursday. &nbsp;I've spent the last 4 years at that company making big sales. &nbsp;This year a different part of the company lost $20M in revenue so they went searching for people to fire. &nbsp;The VP doesn't seem to like me so I got the boot.</p>

<p>It's mostly ok. &nbsp;I was thinking of leaving anyway. &nbsp;I have a head hunter, and possibly two actually, looking after me and my job search already. &nbsp;I also have a pretty large network of other people that have been at this company and left that now work in the same space and have a good impression of me.</p>
<p>Here's the plan. &nbsp;Step 1. &nbsp;Spam my network.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-AqCxfV4L3Lg%2FTbCbVuCf6HI%2FAAAAAAAAEpA%2FDCBBIrhKSVk%2Fs1600%2F_MG_1849.jpg&amp;f=1" width="1600" height="1067"/></p>
<p>With so many friends in the higher ed stem sales industry that know that I kill it out there I'm telling everyone I know I was fired and that I'm looking for work. &nbsp;If I had tried to do this without getting fired they all would have been acting against their own interest. &nbsp;Why would I help someone that helps keep me employed find another gig? &nbsp;But now that I've been fired for personal reasons people are like "damn the man, let's help this guy get a new job." &nbsp;The founder of the company that was bought by a bigger company that I work for is helping, VP of stem is helping, lots of people are now engaged in helping me find a new gig.</p>
<p>Step 2. &nbsp;Hard Work</p>
<p><img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fdanblackonleadership.info%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F01%2Fhard_work_sign1.jpg&amp;f=1" width="864" height="573"/></p>
<p>Find a job is a full time job. &nbsp;I literally waited about 20 minutes before I started making calls asking folks to 1. say something nice about me on linkedin, 2. send out feelers to people they know. &nbsp;3. &nbsp;Say a prayer, send some light, or whatever in my general direction. &nbsp;I've been doing this for 2 days and I'm still not done reaching my folks. &nbsp;I'm also calling others that have lost their job in the hope that they have connections to companies that I'm not even considering to help me land some interviews and a better gig. &nbsp;Then it's time to spam applications to random companies too. &nbsp;My industry is dying a bit so I either need to get into the places where it's growing or I need to find a new industry. &nbsp;Either works... &nbsp;I just like doing consultative sales for STEM.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Optimism</p>
<p><img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-vzNju3_yLl0%2FTeBSguLslyI%2FAAAAAAAAAmU%2FbN9sIBzTeCM%2Fs1600%2FOptimism_by_meppol.jpg&amp;f=1" width="350" height="400"/></p>
<p>I didn't spend the last four years kicking ass at sales just to be defeated by one dumb ass with a short sighted plan. &nbsp;I know I'm going to find another job and it shouldn't take me that long. &nbsp;The fun thing is that they gave me severance. &nbsp;I was already planning on leaving. &nbsp;So, assuming I get a gig before my severance runs out they were kind enough to pay me for a job search and let all my network suddenly support me. &nbsp;I'm going to be laughing my ass to bank when I cash those checks and turn around and start a new job almost right away. &nbsp;The VP that fired me was trying to do me harm, but he doesn't know that he kindly just handed me $20k or more. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, based on what I know the company has a shit pipeline for next year. &nbsp;That means next year is going to be worse. &nbsp;That means that money they had this year for letting people go won't be around next time. &nbsp;People aren't going to get nice severance. &nbsp;They are going to get kicked to the curb. &nbsp;Again, he tried to harm me, but I don't think he recognizes that he helped me.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Anyway, shoot me an upvote, send me some love, and if you get fired don't waste time. &nbsp;Tell your network as fast as you can and see what you can put together. &nbsp;I'll keep you updated.</p>
