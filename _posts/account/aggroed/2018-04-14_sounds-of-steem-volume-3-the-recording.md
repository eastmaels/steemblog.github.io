I'm stoked to present the recording of a live digital concert hosted on MSP-Waves featuring Steemian musicians.  As always it's a fun combination of Muppet Show esque antics of live on air radio with some exceptionally talented musicians and performers.

I'm happy to pay 10SBD to the first person in the comments to share a brief timeline showing: musician, time on the recording, and name of song.
