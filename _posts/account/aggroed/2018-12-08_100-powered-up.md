You guys might consider powering up your posts completely.  SBD is pretty low.  If you're getting paid in SBD on the posts at all or we happen to bounce around such that SBD payments on posts are happening you're getting a reduced payment.

I'd suggest going 100% steem power unless you need that .5 sbd to eat something tomorrow.

To change it scroll down past where you would put in tags and there's an advanced settings link.  Choose 100% SP.  You have a chance to scrounge up some extra internet monies by doing so.
