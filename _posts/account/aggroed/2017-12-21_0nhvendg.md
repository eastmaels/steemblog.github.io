Hey all, I just had an opportunity to record a conversation with Rene from @world5list.  He's the owner of the YouTube channel World5list, which has 800,000 subscribers.

He's one of several people I've spoken with recently about how frustrating YouTube has become.  Between demonetization of videos, outright censorship, and growing competition it's becoming less and less attractive for content creators.

Rene has been looking at Patreon and Steemit as two platforms that might offer him a legitimate alternative to YouTube (along with his business partner Angelo who runs TheyWillKillYou with 1,000,000 subscribers).

https://www.patreon.com/theywillkillyou

It seems to me that there are ways to support the central needs of both groups.  Steem needs visibility to help grow our active user population and accounts.  YouTube personalities need steady income streams to support their work.  Pretty sure we can help one another.  Steem can help the YouTube channel operators form a community and start shifting their efforts from YouTube centric to Steem first with a Youtube backup.

Steem can support them financially and they can use their reach to help raise awareness across the internet.  I'm personally committed to helping this happen.

@world5list has agreed to release exclusive content not only to Patreon, but to Steemit as well, and basically shift to a busines model with a world premier on Steem and Patreon and archive on YouTube. These videos normally cost $20 for one-month early access, but they're providing it to us here on Steemit for free!  


To give you an idea and to make this a little more concrete, here is a link to episode 2 of Escobar Uncovered - an extended interview with Pablo Escobars' former main hitman; part of a series that Angelo and Rene recorded in Medellin, Colombia. Several trailers and episode one are already publicly accesible on YouTube, but THIS episode is not yet available to the public and I am curious to see how the Steemit community feels about having exclusive access to this type of unique content. Do you think that this would add value to the platform as a whole? Is this something you would support with upvotes to potentially enable them to eventually abandon YouTube all together in favor of Steemit?!

In the end, these two populations need each other and should help solve one another's greatest challenges.

I'm hosting a YouTube/Media forum on mspwaves Satuday January 13 at 11am EST (1600 UTC).  Hopefully you, some whales, some devs, and some youtube personalities representing millions of subscribers will come join us.
