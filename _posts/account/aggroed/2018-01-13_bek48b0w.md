I'll add more detailed thoughts to the live broadcast later, but we had an extremely healthy conversation with Steemit, developers, and content creators.  Literally millions of subscribers from all walks of life were represented by about 10 content creators and Dtube and Dsound were talked about.

We talked some about the struggles of coming over to Steem, starting a channel, and some of the differences between this community and others, in particular how kindness has incentive on Steem.

It was fun having so many talented people on and I'm grateful for the folks that listened in live (we had around 100 live).  I'm looking forward to a great 2018 and seeing a greatly expanded steemiverse of content creators!
