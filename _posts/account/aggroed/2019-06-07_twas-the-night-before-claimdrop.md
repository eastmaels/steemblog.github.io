'Twas the night before Claimdrop, when all through the house
Not a blogger was stirring, not even a big mouth;
The wallets were waiting by the blockchain with care,
In hopes that Palcoin soon would be there;

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of steem monsters danced in their heads;
And Krystle in her 'kerchief, and Aus in his cap,
Had just settled down for a long crypto winter's nap,

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The promise of moonshot on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the lustre of digital gold to wallets below,
When, what to my wondering eyes has these bods,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight mega mods,

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be Scot's hair flick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;

"Now, Clayboyn! now, Ponsford! now, Kubbi and Crimmi!
On, Disco! on Ma1ne! on, Shaners and Clowni!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the buy wall!
Now steem away! steem away! steem away all!"

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh wallet full of  Palcoin for you!

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of the big fatty goof
As I drew in my hand, and was turning around,
Down the chimney Scot came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of PALcoin he had flung on his back,
And he wide eyes from opening Splinterlands packs.

His eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the sweet icky icky encircled his head like a wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all* the wallets with PALcoin; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside the clock pointing to night noon,
And giving a nod, he promised that crypto would moon;

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
HAPPY CLAIMDROP TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!

Check your wallets.  Millions of PALcoin went out.  You have a month to claim it.  If you didn't get some and think you should have contact us in Discord.  Not everyone will claim and we can figure something out in a month.

Blacklisted users didn't get any.  Inactive accounts didn't get any.  Accounts with 10SP or less on their accounts didn't get any.  Whales got capped.

Happy steeming, should be better than a fork...

## PALcoin mining

## EDIT I may jumped the gun a little.  I’m not positive it’s all out yet.
