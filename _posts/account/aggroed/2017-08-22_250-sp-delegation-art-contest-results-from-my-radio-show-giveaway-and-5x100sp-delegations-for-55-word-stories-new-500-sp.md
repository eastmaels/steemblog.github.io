So, I just tossed another 750 SP in delegations.  These are a combination of winnings from my posts and earnings from my Witness that I'm giving back.

## Minnow Mayor on MSP Waves! <h2>

On the air on mspwaves the Minnow Support Project radio station I run a show from 9-11 PM EST on Sundays called "Minnow Mayor's Townhall."  I'm the self-proclaimed Mayor of Minnowtown, so it's a fun rock show I do.  As part of trying to build the audience I do giveaways.  I gave 25SBD to @sircork for some dice roll offs.  I awarded 150 SP delegation to Sammosk via msp-creativebot and 100 SP delegation to @juliakponsford.  Here is the winning art they made on behalf of MSPWaves!

## Writing Contest <h2>

I ran a 55 word writing contest.  https://steemit.com/contest/@aggroed/500-sp-delegation-challenge-55-word-creative-story

## Writing Contest Winners <h2>

I posted a 55 word short story contest.  Got some great entries.  @gmuxx won squarely by vote total, but when I asked him if it would be ok to spread some love around he didn't hesitate (I'm going to send him 50sbd from the meet your mod post, so he'll be ok).

---

@gmuxx won with:

## Marauder's Curse

The Marauder's Curse shuddered through a tight three sixty turn, the old girl creaking in defiance.

"Ready photons, await my signal." Barked Zain.

Without reply, Swelker prepared the ordnance.

"Steady, steady--Now!"

With four quick thoomps, they hurtled toward their foes, obliterated within seconds.

"Man, I love this game. Easiest crypto we ever earned."

@redhens gets a win with a dark one...

## Clutch

I clutched her body against my chest, her chubby arm loose at my side, her head tipped back, blue lips parted toward the ceiling.

Death stared at us from his seat at the table, then he slowly rose.

"No!" I screamed as he pulled her small lifeless body from my arms.

"You came for me!"

@dogeking comes in with a twist!

## THE MISUNDERSTOOD FATHER

And there I was, faced with the very thing I feared the most.

My senses heightened and my heart thumped loudly as I dodged strikes that would end me in an instant.

It wasn’t the strikes that frightened me. But that they were dealt by my son.

Then I confessed, “Luke, I am your father.”

@andrewgenaille claims a prize with:

## The Orphan

"That's it? I'm out and you forget about me?" Janet asked.
"That's the law," Helen said compassionately, "You're eighteen, you've aged out of the system."
"What am I supposed to do!" Janet was on the verge of panic. "I don't have a job."
Helen smiled, offering hope, "I want to talk to you about Crypto."

@geke earns some real crypto delegation with:

## Fiat

“What's your password, pop?”
Dad blinked at the screen with clouded eyes. “Motleyfool, one word.”
“That's it? No key? 2FA?”
“What's that, son?”
Four clicks and the stock was sold.
“Six percent. Pretty good.” His father leaned back into a grin.
“My bitcoin earned 42 percent, dad.”
“Your bitcoin's not real.”
“Neither are your dollars.”
