I was fortunate enough to have a 40+ minute call with @elear to talk about the utopian-io project and to walk my way through the interface and actually submit my first contribution to the project.  That contribution is this video tutorial on how to get involved in utopian.io, how to submit to it, and how to get rewarded by it.

The first time I logged into the system I felt a little overwhelmed as I was trying to figure out all that was going on.  I thought people, and minnows especially would have a hard time figuring this place out, but with upvotes worth several hundred dollars it seems worth the time to figure it out.

I'm personally quite excited for this project and thinking about ways that I can contribute to it.
