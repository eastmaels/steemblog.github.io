Please find this video of the nominations process.  Voting has started in the Steem Alliance Discord.  A post is forthcoming from them, but you can find them and the voting booth here: https://discord.gg/jTjwkRX.

Congrats to those who are elected.  You have a big job getting proposals in from everyone and managing an election of those proposals by the community.  God Speed and may the eternal blockchain in the sky upvote your efforts.
