Hey folks!  I host a radio show every Sunday night called the Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  It's a call in show hosted on MSP waves radio.  You can find the station at www.mspwaves.com.

The format of the show is to welcome guests who choose to come on.  This week I was lucky enough to have the current champion of the Steemit Witnesses come on and talk about his various projects.

Jesta has amassed a number of excellent projets that help support the block and use it in additional ways to the conventional steemit.com website.

He's created chainbb.  A Bulletin Board styled posting System with Steemit as a back bone.
He's created Vessel.  A multi account wallet for Steemit.
He's created steemdb which is an excellent tracking system for every vote, follow, transaction, witness vote, and basically anything that happens on the block you can see it easily there (I've already posted about how I'm on there literally every day.

So, this gifted programmer comes on air and we have a good 20-30 min discussion about Steemit, his projects, the Minnow Support Project, and the future of the Steemit blockchain.

I had a great time interviewing him and hopefully you'll have a great time listening in and getting to know Steemit's number one Witness on the block!
