![Steemit Minnow.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmecPxF6LjiLPwAfrJb6V4BJrxvG5zVv48emuuEobq1wnq/Steemit%20Minnow.png)Well, it turns out I have about 30 more living relatives than I thought.  I was able to catch up with a cousin of mine and just found out that I have a pretty extensive maternal family.  I thought I was one of the last and the name would die out after my generation.  Turns out there's tons of us.  I spent some time with terrestial friends today for the first time in a long time and spent the evening talking to family.  Pretty amazing.

Anyway, as for Minnow Mayor I don't have much planned.  As per usual it's the muppet show and you all are welcome to come on air and talk about basically anything and everything.  Looking forward to it.
