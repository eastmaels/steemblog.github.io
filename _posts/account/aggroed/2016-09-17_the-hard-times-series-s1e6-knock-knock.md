<p>"No, you can't go out there! &nbsp;It hasn't been long enough!" &nbsp;Molly grabbed at her sister.</p>
<p>"Have you tracked the days? &nbsp;It's been three years." &nbsp;Gwen insisted.</p>
<p>"Momma, said that it would take at least 6 for the radiation to cut down." &nbsp;Molly tried to pull her sister's hands off the door.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, she ain't here no more is she. &nbsp;We can't keep living like this and we don't know for sure if we ever got nuked. &nbsp;The damn radio doesn't work." &nbsp;She shot a glance at radio station with burnt out circuit breaker. &nbsp;One happened to be on the desk, but they never tried to put it back into place.</p>
<p>"Gwen, we don't get but one shot at opening that door. &nbsp;If you go out there and it still ain't right there ain't no going back. &nbsp;We'll get sick, and the air in here will make us sicker every day. &nbsp;We have food and water right here. &nbsp;Enough for 4 more years. &nbsp;We don't need to risk it!" &nbsp;Molly pushed her sister away from the door.</p>
<p>"WE DO NEED TO RISK IT" she yelled "The damn purifier broke. &nbsp;&nbsp;Backup isn't sure to last forever. &nbsp;And get your damn hands off'a me." &nbsp;Gwen poked her sister in the chest. &nbsp;"You just don't want to do this cause you're afraid that the law still knows you stole that car for Jimmy."</p>
<p>Molly was shocked. &nbsp;"Why you gotta bring that up? &nbsp;You know I hate it when you bring that up!" &nbsp;She grabbed her sister's hair and started pulling it. &nbsp;They began shouting at one another and punching each other, but then everything stopped. &nbsp;The world stopped. &nbsp;Time froze and all that lingered was a loud knock on the door...</p>
