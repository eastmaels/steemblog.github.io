For your reading pleasure I present two more 55-word stories.  These are harder to write than you might imagine.  If you haven't tried keeping yourself to just 55 words it's a challenge.  Normally, you have to think about how you're going to double cross your audience.  You also need to foreshadow it.  You want something that makes people think about it after they've read it.  But you can't monologue it.  Have to show it... and give it a twist or leave them hanging.


I'm happy to toss some upvotes to folks that want to write a 55 word response in the comments.

I got this.
She crouched down waiting for the gun.
Sideways glances showed Olympic competition.
They got this too though.
Set.  Game face on.  Bang.
Run, jump, run, jump
Photo finish.
Exhaustion.
A million memories of practice all leading up to this moment.
She started as a kid.  Sprints every day.
And the judges declare...

It used to be Mirror Mirror, but now she says Magic Mirror.
Sex in the City?  NO!!! Sex and the City.
If you build it he will come.
What does it all mean?
My heart skipped a beat when it moved!
Toto, I've got a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
Toto Says "Definately not."
