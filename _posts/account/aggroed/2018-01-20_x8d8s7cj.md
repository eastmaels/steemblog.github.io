It was an absolute pleasure to host the Steem Witness Forum today.  If anything is clear it's that Steem has a fantastic group of people supporting it.  We have devs, community leaders, business leaders, and a team of folks that have a strong interest in seeing the Steem ecosystem continue to grow sustainably.

For the most part this show followed the questions posed in the last post:

What is the largest problem on Steem? How do we address it?
Should Steem grow and if so what does Steem need to grow?
What should our priorities be?
Can we handle the growth?
What's causing the rise in price even as bitcoin hovers in the 12k range?
Are the rewards being distributed well?
What constitutes abuse? How should we handle abuse?
How are voting bots positively or negatively effecting Steem?
What do you want Steemit to work on?
Closing thoughts to share?

## I'll work on getting a outline up <h2>

I'll go back and listen to this, and get some notes up about the event so you can listen in on thoughts to various questions from various panel members.

## A great audience <h2>

I saw a really healthy discussion in the chat and would encourage you to both listen to the conversation and watch text scroll because at time the audience participation especially by @fyrstikken is driving parts of the conversation.

## Intense Gratitude <h2>

We had around 100 live listeners, 7 panelists, and a small crew helping keep Discord running without spam and msp-waves operating normally.  I'm very grateful to the folks that spent some time managing this.  I'm also grateful to the whales and minnows listening in on a Saturday to hear about Steem.  It's an honor to serve as a Witness on this platform and I appreciate your support.
