I'm thankful for the fact that linear rewards now allows vote buying.  I'm concerned tho that the shitposters are gonna win the day.  If you love steem. If you love this place.  then right now I encourage you to go out and vote buy on your best posts!

## But aggroed vote buying is shady! <h2>

Well, vote buying isn't shady or not shady.  it's just a thing that's allowed on the platform because of hf19.  Some people may have written it will be a "clusterfuck," but no one listened at the time.  

So, now we have linear rewards and HF 19 (and a rewards pool at 700k down from 2 million).  If you votebuy you're going to get more rewards.  If you don't someone else will.  Turns out the people that don't want to use them are people that think of their post quality as high.  if none of the high quality authors use them then it's easier for the shit posters to vote buy for less money because there is no competition.  therefor the shitposters win.

## If you don't use the bid bots you're helping the shit posters scam money! <h2>

That's right.  it's as much a problem of you not using them on good posts as it is on shitposters using them on shit posts.  We could also consider changing hf19 and linear rewards, but until then... you're supporting the shitposters by not buying votes.

## quick upside <h2>

Utopian-io relies on hf19 to work.  So if we kill hf19 we likely harm that quite a bit.  @minnowsupport is able to offer rewards to minnows on brand new authors and that works because of hf19.  So many fun choices to make.
