A futurist and thought leader has died recently.  Jacque Fresco, creator of the Venus Project has died May 18th, 2017 in Sebring FL.  This will sadden many people who followed his work looking at one possible iteration of society.

I liked a lot of what he had to say, but ultimately came away from his main thought, namely the resource based economy, as a giant give away to bad people.  Let me explain this as a lot of folks seem to really like his ideas.

## Zeitgeist <h2>
A lot of people learned about Jacque in the movie Zeitgeist.  Zeitgeist goes through a couple of reasonably accurate rounds of problems that exist in modern culture.
1.  Religions seem to be based on the same narrative, which is actually a celestial story.
2.  Money is created out of thin air by banks to the detriment of the world
3.  False flag terrorist attacks prove that bad people are in power
4.  We need a new system that eliminates the creation of money and simply aggregates and trades in resources.

## The problem <h2>

He had me until 4.  Right now the Fed has to print money and then trade that money to horde resources.  In a resource based economy governments would simply control the resources.  I don't like what governments do most of the time now.  Imagine if they had even more control over every aspect of the country.

## a different solution <h2>

A real reason I like crypto currencies is that I don't think there are too few currencies in the world.  I don't think there are enough.  We also don't have enough outside of teh 167 governments that control 7.2B people.  A few more choices... especially those not backed by war, threat of war, or constant violence and media manipulation would be swell.

So, I'm sad that he passed, but I'm glad we didn't just turn over all our stuff to governments... that would make things worse.  That said, some of his city planning work was pretty cool.
