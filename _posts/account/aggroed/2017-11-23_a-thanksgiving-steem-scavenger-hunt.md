Thanksgiving is tomorrow!  My family has had a tradition for years of sharing our gratefuls at the dinner table.  It's always the most prominent on Thanksgiving because that was my mother's favorite holiday.

## My gratefuls <h2>

I feel blessed to be working on a paradigm shift towards a society based on the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.

I feel blessed to be part of an incredible group of people called the Minnow Support Project.

I feel blessed to be a witness on the Steem platform.

I feel blessed to be in good health.

I feel blessed to have a family and a home.

I'm a lucky man with a exceptional work ethic.

I'm grateful to call Steem my digital home and grateful you let me be a part of this community.
