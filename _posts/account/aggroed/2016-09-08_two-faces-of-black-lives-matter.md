<p>If you don't live under a rock you've heard about the black lives matter movement. &nbsp;There are many impassioned people protesting various types of oppression and violence against the poor and especially the poor that are black. &nbsp;One example is in the exploding prison population, which is heavily targetted towards minorities.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/US_incarceration_timeline-clean.svg/693px-US_incarceration_timeline-clean.svg.png" width="693" height="464"/></p>
<p>Taken from google taken from wikipedia: "According to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS),<strong>2,220,300</strong> adults were incarcerated in US federal and state prisons, and county jails in 2013 â€“ about 0.91% of adults (1 in 110) in the U.S. resident population. Additionally, <strong>4,751,400</strong> adults in 2013 (1 in 51) were on probation or on parole. "</p>
<p>When you add together those in jail, prison, and on parole a full 2% of the country has been found guity and dealt with the by justice system. &nbsp;Blacks males represent 37% of that prison population however all blacks make up ~12% of the US population.</p>
<p>In addition to intense incarceration of black men there is also large concerns over violence against black men particularly by police. &nbsp;<a href="http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/unarmed/">Last year alone over 100 unarmed black men were murdered by police</a>.</p>
<p>So, on the one hand you have extreme frustration and outrage boiling to the surface by genuine protesters and family of slain and incarcerated men. &nbsp;On the other hand you have neo-liberal take over of the movement. &nbsp;Don't take it from me. &nbsp;Take it from a <a href="http://breaking911.com/ferguson-protest-leader-darren-seals-found-fatally-shot-burning-car/">recently murdered/assassinated outspoken leader</a> of the Black Lives Matter movement <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/08/16/hacked-soros-memo-baltimore-riots-provide-unique-opportunity-reform-police/">Darren Seals</a>.</p>

<p>At first I was shocked. &nbsp;BLM made millions? &nbsp;No way, but then it turns out to be true. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/16/black-lives-matter-cashes-100-million-liberal-foun/">BLM has pledges of more than $100M</a>.</p>
<p>See, it looks like BLM is also being supported by none other than Billionaire George Soros. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/08/16/hacked-soros-memo-baltimore-riots-provide-unique-opportunity-reform-police/">A recent hack into his email system shows a $650,000 donation.</a></p>
<p>Soros is well known for destabilizing governments by co-opting legitimate movements to further his political and economic agendas.</p>
<p>So, what am I saying. &nbsp;BLM is simultaneously both an incredibly valid and much needed protest against a completely rigged and violent system and also a co-opted movement that is using these activists to drive a particular agenda and destabilize the US in the process.</p>
<p>I'll continue to support the genuine protest against the killing of unarmed people and the long mandatory sentencing for non-violent offenders, but I'm going to have a hard time trusting that anything that comes out of the BLM movement is actually working towards a healthy outcome.</p>
