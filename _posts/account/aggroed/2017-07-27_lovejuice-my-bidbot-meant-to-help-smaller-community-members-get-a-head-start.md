Ok, so I have a voting bot.  It's a bidbot.  It's using the DrOtto build made by @inertia, which is the same program that runs @booster, @bellyrub, and @discordia.  Some people have concerns over these bots and things like @randowhale, but I think they are a neat addition to the community.  If you're just upvoting your own shit posts or comments it's lame, if you're upvoting your own posts that's mediocre, but if you're using it on other people then it can have some really awesome effects.

## How do bidbots work <h2>

Bid bots have SP on them and you can purchase votes from them.  You send some sbd with a transfer note of the post you want to upvote.  Every so often the bot will vote based on the bids.  If there's only one bid then that person gets all of that vote.  If there is more than one bidder it's split.

## Sample Split <h2>

Jimmy bids 1 SBD
Sarah bids 2 SBD
John bids 7 SBD

Jimmy will get 10% of the total outgoing vote.
Sarah will get 20% of the outgoing vote.
John will get 70% of the outgoing vote.

## High bids <h2>

Lovejuice has 12k Sp and votes roughly every hour or so.  The max upvote is around a 60% upvote.  It's worth around 1.2-1.6 SBDs.  I haven't checked exactly so I'm not positive.  In terms of bidding you don't want to bid more than 1.2-1.6 SBDs because you'll get no return.  If other people have already bid over 1SBD worth you may want to wait for the next round of bidding.

## Minimum bids <h2>

@lovejuice has a 0.1SBD minimum bid.  So for 0.1 sbds you basically have a chance at up to 1.2-1.6 SBDs.  If you're timing is good it's a pretty sweet deal.

## it's not a whale <h2>

One of the things about this is that the bidbot is specifically not a whale.  You won't win 40 sbds on a full vote, but you're also not spending a ton.  I also don't feel like it's draining or raping the pool.  I don't think any of these bots are.  It's giving access to larger votes to smaller accounts and a fun way to get a head start.  If you do think those bigger bots are bad though I hope you can tolerate a much smaller one as a way to help newbies get off the ground or to make friends for short monies.

## moar love, moar juice <h2>

So, earlier today I made a post on the account letting folks know @lovejuice got an upgrade.  Here's hoping you choose to use lovejuice.  Oh, and btw, if you want to catch the resteem from me or lovejuice you better use the bot on someone else.

## write up a review and ping me <h2>

I'm happy to share some good stories with the people if you can spare some time to talk about lovejuice.
