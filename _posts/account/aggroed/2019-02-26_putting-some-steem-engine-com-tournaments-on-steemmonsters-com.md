As an example of how Steem Monsters can be used to promote other projects we're taking some of the Steem we've made on Steem-Engine.com, we're making some tournaments for Steem Monsters, and we're hoping to help more people learn about Steem-Engine.com.  This will also line up nicely with some announcements we'll have this week.  GOOD TIMES!  

Here's the art for the Tournament's we'll be offering.  You'll be able to check them out on Steemmonsters.com --> tournaments.

Sometime this year we'll be able to hand out the ENG tokens this way too. I'm pretty excited for that!
