People  ie @berniesanders say we're just crazy conspiracy theorists, but what will they do when presented with an interview like this?  Scoff, laugh it off, and ignore it because it doesn't fit in their world view.  It's a pretty dark path to walk down to figure out how this world actually works.  It's no wonder people don't and instead just do their thing and every so often wonder why we're constantly at war, everyone seems to have a chronic health conditition, 50% of the wealth rests in the hands of 8 people and think of these as abnormalities as opposed to purposely baked into the system.

Laugh if you want.  This is how the world works.
