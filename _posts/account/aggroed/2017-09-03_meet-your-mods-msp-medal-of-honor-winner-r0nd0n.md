OK, quick reminder 1kSP and 25 SBD up for grabs tonight on the Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  Tune in at 9pm EST (about 9hrs from now) right after @swelker101 and @isaria have their show.  Speaking of MSPWaves we wouldn't have a station if it wasn't for the help of this MSP Medal of Honor Winner turned M0derat0r:  @r0nd0n

When did you hear about the MSP?
## @r0nd0n: I was still but a tadpole in the steemit pond, and one of the people I was following happened to share a post by @minnowsupport that caught my eye. 
Why did you join the MSP?
## @r0nd0n: I would have joined right away, but registering on discord was my biggest hurdle. Not that registering there is hard, in fact it's very easy, but I'm hesitant to make yet another account somewhere unless I'm sure I need it. First, I heard there was a voting bot, which was intriguing, but then I found out about a channel for getting posts critiqued by your peers, and that was incentive enough to finally bite the bullet and get a discord username. 
What do you think is the best aspect of the MSP?
## @r0nd0n: In general, the best aspect is definitely the community. The engagement you get on the PALnet discord adds a whole new layer of depth to the people you interact with on steemit, and I find myself constantly making connections with people I'd probably otherwise overlook. MSP has rapidly fostered a plethora of burgeoning communities, services, and niches that constantly impresses me on a daily basis. In essence, joining MSP is like having cheatcodes turned on for steemit.
You're a moderator what does that mean to you?
## @r0nd0n: I look at it as being a vessel for guiding and helping steemians receive the benefits of the largest steemit discord community. I get to do my part to make sure the vision of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty continues for future members to enjoy, and it's worth every second put in.
What's your service project?
## @r0nd0n: I've helped minnows present their content to their followers in (hashtag)msp-workshop ever since I joined MSP, I started a service called @freezepeach which neutralizes flags on controversial subjects to encourage discourse and diversity of opinion on steemit, and most recently I've stepped up to help manage the fascilitation of MSP's very own 24/7 radio station: @msp-waves. I also hope to contribute some beginner and intermediate tech guides for the new MSP Library.
how much time do you spend on MSP stuff?
## @r0nd0n: Enough time to strongly consider lobbying for an addiction warning when advertising the discord server.
Why does it matter to you so much? 
## @r0nd0n: The engagement and action that come from the various projects and services have made me a believer that this is something worth working hard to preserve and nurture.
We need some channel mods, why should people do it?
## @r0nd0n:  You get to be the change you want to see while meeting others who share similar passions in life. Managing even one channel in PAL is hard job, but if you put in the effort, you too can grow your very own community within a community where anything is possible.
What excites you about Steemit?
## @r0nd0n: The combination of paid blogging with the trust the blockchain brings about a whole new way of thinking about things, along with plenty of oppurtunities for those who are willing to work hard to fill market demand. The potential in this market of ideas is one of the most exciting things I've ever seen. 
What's a long term vision for where Steemit is going? and how do you fit into that?
## @r0nd0n: I honestly don't know what the future holds for steemit, but that's also part of the excitement. I have just been taking it day by day, expecting nothing, yet gaining an entirely new world.
What can MSP be doing better?  
## @r0nd0n: Considering that most users don't vote for witnesses, (7.5% voting is the figure I saw), I think we have a unique oppurtunity to educate the minnows in our pond about the importance of witness voting. However, the implimentation of such a measure could be tricky, but I think it's a worthwhile goal to consider moving forward.
How can minnows contribute to the system and grow their accounts?
## @r0nd0n: Be the change you want to see; if something is missing or not done right, make it happen yourself. Also, make meaningful connections with the people behind the steemit accounts which interest you. And finally, don't do it for the money, do it to enrich others. Keep selflessly sharing that bit of wisdom which could only come from your unique perspective, and the rewards will be much more than what comes from upvotes on a post.
What else would you want to share here?
## @r0nd0n: I want to give a big thank you to all the people that help make PAL what it is; to the delegators whose generosity knows no bounds, the members who produce so much wonderful content that I can never read all I want, the witnesses who keep steemit running, the mods over at PAL keeping the balance between chaos and order, and a special shoutout to @sircork and the guys behind the scenes at @msp-waves: @globocop, @ma1neevent, @uniwhisp, and @inquiringtimes
