## <center> *Compromise Leads to Peace* </center>

How do we achieve peace during times of conflict?
Adjusting boundaries and using time and distance to gain perspective can help bring you to a state of compromise.


When two people have an argument there are two conflicting points of view.
It's difficult to compromise and resolve a conflict when our shields are extreme and we haven't allowed some time to pass in order to calm down.
If our shields are too high then we aren't hearing the other person.
If our shields are too low then we are just projecting raw emotion.
Time and distance can help you to gain perspective by self-reflecting.
After we have allowed some time to pass and we feel that we are in an emotionally healthy state of mind then we can work on resolving the conflict through compromise.

## <center> *Using Guidelines to Achieve Peace and Liberty* </center>

Our motto here is ***Do no harm, but take no shit***.
We want people to have personal Liberty, but we also need structure within the community so that other people aren't being harmed.
Under complete and absolute liberty you would actually be free to harm others.
Part of insuring that we can have peace is to have mutually agreed upon rules.

We made community guidelines and standards for the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty discord in order to help achieve and maintain peace.
We can achieve both peace and liberty by voluntarily agreeing to the guidelines and choosing to live by them.

We implemented the governance charter not only as a way to create peace and liberty, but to also create a structure so that it isn't just a small group of people running this place.

The goal is to form committees of minnows that care and who will have a say in how this place operates.
