WOOT!  Finally!  This baby has been merge ready for a few months, and it's finally here!  OK!  Great, so what is keychain and why should we care?!?

## Keychain is:

It's a browser extension for google chrome, brave, and mozilla firefox.  It saves your keys locally.  After you have put in your keys you can interact with steem based websites very easily.  To login to a site that's keychain compatible you literally just type in your name.  Done.

## Giving keys

Giving keys to websites is stupid.  It's like ordering a pack of gum at CVS and handing them your bank login and password.  Why... why would we do this?

Now Steemit joins the list of tools that allow keychain to sign transactions.  No more giving away your keys!

## Websites
Chrome/Brave - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/steem-keychain/lkcjlnjfpbikmcmbachjpdbijejflpcm

Mozilla- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/steem-keychain/

We have a little home for it on the Steem-Engine discord.  So, if you're a dev looking to add it to your site so that anyone on steem can easily use it without fears taht you're going to take their shit then join us here:  https://discord.gg/MbCVbej

## Master Password

You don't have to do this, but I suggest the following.  After you have installed keychain put in your master password.  It will automatically break that down into the posting (social), active (wallet), and memo key, AND IT WON'T SAVE YOUR MASTER PASSWORD.

## Steem-Engine Tokens

Oh, yeah, and as an aside you can check out your steem-engine tokens in this baby.  So, if you've bought some JJM, or saved up some orbs or DEC from Splinterlands you can see how much you have right in the extension, send them, or check a brief history.

## A few websites that use it

splinterlands.io
steem-engine.com
Steempeak.com
Peakmonsters.com
cryptoempirebot.com
dtube.com
steemit.com 

I'm sure there's more.  I think there's a few dozen, but there's a small selection.  One of the things I want to get added to keychain is a list of the various sites that use it and a brief description of the services they provide.


Maybe @stoodkev or @blockchainstudios or some utopian hackzors will submit a PR.

## Thanks Steemit et al!

So, I'm stoked to have this working on one of the biggest sites out there.  I'm pleased to have been involved in the development of this free and open source tool for the community.  Many blessings and thanks to @yabapmatt for designing it, @stoodkev for making it, the splinterlands mavericks for paying for it, @eonwarped for making a pull request and  Steemit (roadscape) for merging this baby in.  Oh, and lest I forget @nateaguila for designing the look and feel of it.
