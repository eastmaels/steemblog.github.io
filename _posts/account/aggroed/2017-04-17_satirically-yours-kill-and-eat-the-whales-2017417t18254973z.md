Satirically Yours news correspondent @aggroed is on the scene covering the comment section of the recent steemitblog hardfork 19 blog.  He is joined by radical blogger Milan E. Al.

Aggroed-  so you seem frustrated with this most recent approach to equality proposed by Steemits central leadership.  Any comment?

Milan- yes!  It would seem the design team is yet again trying to solve the gigantic problem of inequality on steemit that has existed from the very first instance they went live.  Mainly, the steemit oligarchs, some refer to as kindly as whales, are nothing more than federal reserve style aristocrats that have figured out an even less egalitarian way to create wealth.  We propose a sort of reverse cultural revolution where we literally find, flog, and release the finances of the steemit oligarchs so the people have control!

Aggroed- wow, that seems a little intense!  Aren't there other ways that the minnows can have a say?

Milan-  if you want the minnows to have a say you have to make it closer to one account equals one vote.  You can't do that online because bots will take over this place more than they already have.  You'd have to literally have an ID system that was checking that live people were controlling a singular account.  It would look like the steem DMV.  One in every state.  This fledgling entity can't do that especially while providing most of the generated wealth of the community to witnesses that aren't that kind of witness.

It's much simpler to say... "eat the rich."

Aggroed- well I'm a peace nick.  I'm not sure that we should canabalising anyone even those that do have a lot of steem.

Milan-  Ultimately you're as useless as a man without a fine beard.  Do you want 30 people to control 90% of the wealth?  Does that sound like freedom?  Are you some kind of fascist or rich sympathizer?  You too are dead to me.  This interview is over.  I'm going to start this revolution by shitting all over the comments section again.

Aggroed-  and there you have it folks.  One lopsided view of the debate.  We'll try to catch up with less antagonistic spokesperson covering the other side of the debate soon.
