Ok, feels like forever since I've had one of these, though in truth it hasn't been that long.  Ok, so same deal as ever.  This is a call in show.  You guys get to call in and talk about whatever you want.

You want to talk hardfork?  ok
Wanna introduce yourself? great
Got a project you want to expose? I'd love to hear about it?

You got the idea?  If the audience is quiet I'm just sit around and dj random choon songs.  So, come with some stuff you want to talk about.
