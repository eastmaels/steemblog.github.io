# <center> The Peace Academy with @aggroed and @isaria </center>


How do we balance the concepts of Peace and Liberty within a group or community?
Expressing our individual freedoms of speech and actions may sometimes ruffle some feathers.

A guideline that I like to use in order to maintain Peace is:
***Do no harm, but take not shit***


A key element to this guideline is ***Respect***

If your feathers are ruffled due to another expressing their beliefs or ideals in a relatively respectful manner, then it is up to you to take responsibility and *OWN* your feelings.

Someone with a victim mentality mindset would likely blame the other person for *"causing"* them to feel whatever negative emotion they were feeling.

Someone with healthy boundaries would understand that their triggered negative feelings were *their own* and were not *"caused"* by anyone other than themselves.

So let's say for instance you were in a group and you heard someone expressing beliefs or opinions that deeply offended your values, but they were expressed in a way that was not specifically attacking you.
Misunderstanding your own feelings as being *"caused"* by another may lead to you insisting that the other person *STOP* expressing their feelings.  
This is not Liberty, nor is it a Peaceful resolution.

Once you understand that your reaction of feeling offended is completely *your own* and is *not* the other person's fault, it becomes much easier to not even feel offended anymore, which may even lead to a discussion or healthy debate.


Now, if someone is *intentionally* ruffling feathers for the specific reason of trying to get under someone eles's skin, that is a different story.
That's where the guideline of ***Do no harm, but take no shit*** comes into play.
Deliberately trolling or attacking is a form of causing harm and is not conducive to a peaceful environment.


Looking forward to seeing you all tonight!
