Sorry guys.  Construction on the bridge is making me take bus service to make my way to the black rose.  I'm probably still 20 min away.  I'm wearing a bright orange coat and a bright yellow/green vest under that.  I'm doing my best to get there and I'm sorry for the delay.

## in the meantime <h2>

I hope you all find some lovely steemians to sit with.  I know there's a bunch of us going and we are all running late.  If you get there before me grab some appetizers and I'll be along shortly with a credit card.

## door prize <h2>

I'll use whatever rewards this post makes by the time the meetup ends as a door prize for participants.  Sorry for the inconvenience and I'll see you shortly.
