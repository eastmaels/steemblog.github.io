Good morning class.  Here's what's coming up in your ongoing Minnow School.

## 2 places for minnow gathering <h2>

@pfunk was kind enough to create a Minnow Support Channel in steemit chat under the Channel name msp.  Go ahead and check in there and you'll find people have started connecting, sharing stories, and hangin' out.

We also have a Discord channel.  https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw.  The main goal is to get folks to at least have and use an account with Steemit chat, and spend time socializing in Discord.  The Discord room will serve as the primary point of minnow curation.  I'll hopefully have more updates soon, but I'm working on getting a bot up and running to help with curation.

The bot will control @minnowsupport.  And if all the minnows use steemvoter and add @minnowsupport then @minnowsupport will grow more powerful over time.  If all the minnows use streemian and follow @minnowsupport then you'll get the collective strength of @minnowsupport and all the other minnows that follow it.

Be sure you have a mic, an hour to spare, and an example post that you are going to want improvement on.

## I've created a review tab <h2>

On the left side of the discord room is a aggroed-review section.  If you click into that and post the URL of an article you'd like me to review and give pointers on I'll find it there.  I'll probably give public critizism in that chat box so others can see what I think will end up as fairly routine suggestions on formatting and general help guidelines.  But general help, and what to do in this article that I just wrote and what needs to change to make it fit those guidelines sometimes needs eyes on.   If it's too personal I'll use a private message in Discord.

## I'm trying to help a lot of people so please don't ping me directly in steemit chat <h2>

I'm trying to help a huge class, I work full time, I have 2 kids, and I'm trying to post regularly.  Please follow these guidelines.  Post your articles in the discord review tab and I'll help.  Fail once and I'll send you to this page, fail twice and incur my wrath.

## Office hours <h2>

OK, so I'm going to host an office hour in the Discord room.  I'll have a mic.  I'll be talking.  You should have speakers ready to be able to listen.  I'll mention what Minnow School is.  What I can do to help, and start reviewing some of the basics.  From there you'll have a place to interact with eachother, meet friends, upvote and resteem one another, and learn how the dolphins and whales who have a rags to riches story started with nothin' and ended up legends.

## Payment for the course <h2>

If this feels like a free intro level course for Steemit... it is, and it might be the first one like this run by a former college prof.  I'm designing this like a college course.  The payment I'm asking for will not cost you anything tangible.  If you want to attend this class or a later one.  

1. Please upvote and resteem this comment.
2. Follow  @aggroed
3. Tell someone about it in the comments section of an article
4.  Follow @minnowsupport

Once in the class we'll talk about how all the minnows can work together to curate their material and get out of minnowhood.  Should be fun.

I've put up a piece of review and homework here- https://steemit.com/minnowschool/@aggroed/minnow-school-lesson-1-create-your-steemit-mission-statement-in-3-steps
