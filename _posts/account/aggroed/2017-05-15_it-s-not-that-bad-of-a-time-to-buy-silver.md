I don't really track silver day in and day out.  This thing seems to fluctuate between $10 and $40.  Pretty sure the whole market is actually completely manipulated.  That said, right now seems like a pretty ok time to buy.  I want about $1k in silver in my house.  It's not much, but if the hard times come it will be something.  Much more than that and I think it starts looking pretty impractical.  Can't eat it.  Can't shoot it.  Can't make something with it.  That said we're at a low price point for the past 5 years. 

idk.
