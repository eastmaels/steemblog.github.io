So, I'm all about seeing Steem get into the world at large.  Not just the crypto land, but also into the terrestrial world as well.  I'm very keen on the idea that I can live, work, and function off of crypto.  I essentially believe the world is run by immoral banksters, and they operate the Federal Reserve.  Every time I use a dollar I give it value, and I would prefer alternatives.  Another one arrived today.

## @steemgiftcards <h2>

Just launched their account and their [website](https://steem.cards/).

## I feel an obligation to try these things <h2>

I'm getting witness rewards.  I should risk some of those to test things out to help the ecosystem.  So, that's what I did.  I purchased a $100 amazon gift card.  It had $9.95 in fees.  At the time I paid 21.8SBD.

I paid using Steem connect.  Then nothing happened right away.

## A few minutes later <h2>

I got confirmation from them by email-

and a few minutes after that I got the actual giftcard.

I passed it along to muh wife, and now we have $100 more sitting in an Amazon account.  Seems like an excellent way to turn Steem into tangible goods with just a few clicks.


Nice job @xtrodinarypilot and team.
