Picture his hand before you visit this post.  

Ok, I've come to the conclusion that we live in a world where the details around us can change and are fluid.  Things you thought were; aren't.  Things that are one way now won't be later.  It's not just that things change over time.  It's that the world, history, and elements of your life change on the daily.

Here's an example.  Look at C3POs hand.  Was it ever black before?  What about his leg... Do you remember it always being Silver?  Do either of those look weird?  It's not that Star Wars changed something in the movies relative to what you remember.  It's that the fluid universe around you has shifted.  Either we merged timelines, or the matrix had a glitch.  I dont' know for sure, but my memory for Star Wars is pretty tight, and I don't remember this at all.

In my universe it was always shiny.
