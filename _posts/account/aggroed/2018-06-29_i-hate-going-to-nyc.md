So, I'm going to NYC to hang out with @andrarchy and @yabapmatt for a bit tonight.  Should be a fun conversation and I'm very much looking forward to it.  What I'm not looking forward to and already can't stand is being in New York City.

## Country Mouse

I'm a country mouse.  I want a big house, with a lot of land, preferrably an underground bunker with a small militia's worth of armaments with food for me, my family, and a small neighboorhood to last a year.  That's the dream.  The exact opposite of that dream is NYC.

I don't begrudge the people that live there.  I don't understand how they do it, but everyone gets to do their thing in this world.  NYC living isn't for me.  A big part of that is cops.  In general I don't care for cops.  As the great anarchist Ammond Hannesey said "An anarchist is a person who doesn't need a cop to tell them what to do... Ahh judge... what good are your damn laws anyway.  The good people don't need them and the bad people don't obey them!"

## Parking ticket

So, I wake up at like 4am to drive to NYC before I have to hit traffic with every freaking car coming south from New England for 4th of July.  I make it pretty far and then I get into the city and realize everything is 1 or 2 hour parking.  I have scheduled calls all day today so I need a place to stop, but I get in a little later than I meant... Now i have to find a place to use a restroom, get a little food, and park for like an hour.

I find a 2 hour parking spot and leave to get my food craving satieted.  Then I return to find a ticket.  My car was apparently parked in a section where you can't park on Friday mornings from 8:30-9am.  I was there at like 8:53.  So, that 7 minutes of panic to find some cooked food and find a restroom in New York cost me $65.

How do you animals live like this?  You can't park.  You can't drive.  You can't move without getting arrested, tazed, choked, or shot.  Can someone explain to me how this is cool?  NYC is the new modern prison complex.  Here's a little segment from My Dinner with Andre.  Escape friends.  Escape

## On a side note this is where I won one of my favorite traffic ticket fights

I straight up wrote in a letter the judge was committing a crime against humanity for running the legal scheme they are all doing.  Everyone else that morning lost their case to the state.  I won.  Case dismissed.  I didn't even contest that I was illegally crossing the street by their code.  I did that... but I was arguing the state doesn't have jurrisdiction or the right to run the court, and in fact are entering into fraud and committing crimes against humanity for the illegal scheme of private maritime courts they are operating.  

Good times.
