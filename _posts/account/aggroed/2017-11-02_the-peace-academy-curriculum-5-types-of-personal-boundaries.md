## Personal Boundaries Overview

As previously discussed, healthy boundaries fall somewhere between porous and rigid boundaries.

In order to function in a way that brings about peace we may need to adjust our shields and boundaries depending on the situation and our current emotional state.

We need to have our shields low enough so that we can actually hear others and receive any constructive criticism, but we also need them high enough so that we aren’t emotionally raw and  projecting negative energy.
The goal is to achieve the middle range of healthy boundaries.

Having our boundaries at healthy levels allows us to be in the mindset to clearly communicate effectively and with empathy.

## 5 Types of Personal Boundaries

### *Physical*
Physical Boundaries refer to your physical body as well as your privacy and personal space.
The physical aspect involves how we feel about being touched or touching others, and includes an awareness as to what is appropriate depending on the situation or individuals involved.
Personal space can involve a physical aspect, but can also include the privacy of your personal items.

### *Emotional Boundaries*
Healthy Emotional boundaries allow us to separate our own emotions from other’s emotions.
These boundaries help us to not project our emotions on to others and also help us to not take on the emotions of others.  It’s like a force field that can protect us from feeling responsibility or guilt from other’s negative emotions and it also prevents us from emotionally projecting on to other people.


### *Intellectual Boundaries*
Healthy Intellectual Boundaries include being clear about our own values, thoughts and opinions.
Healthy boundaries include standing your ground and not allowing someone else to force their opinions on you, but also being flexible enough to hear opposing views without become angry or rigid.

### *Time Boundaries*
Time Boundaries refer to how you allocate your time for your own personal needs.  Healthy Time Boundaries involve being aware of not demanding too much of another persons time and also being clear with others about your time needs. 

### *Material Boundaries*
Material Boundaries involve your material possessions and what you are willing or not willing to share.
Healthy material boundaries involve not imposing your needs upon others and also setting limits and being clear with others about what you are willing to share.
