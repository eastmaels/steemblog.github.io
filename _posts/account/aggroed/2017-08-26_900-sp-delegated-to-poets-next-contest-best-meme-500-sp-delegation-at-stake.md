In my last delegation post I put up a poetry contest.  I shouldn't have done that.  I'm no judge of poetry.  You're feelings are what your feelings are.  You're writing and passion is yours.  How can I judge that?  Did you solve a problem correctly?  Sure I'll grade that.  You wrote some fiction... does it make any sense?  Sure I can judge that.  Poetry?  Poetry?  The subtle lines of context bleeding from you heart to page and dripping fresh hurt into my eyes... and you want me to judge that?  No way.  So I'm cheating... and it's good news for you.  For those that made a poem I'm just gonna delegate 100SP.  Everyone get's 100 SP delegated to them directly except @sammo, who had asked that I delegate his winnings to @msp-creativebot to help spread the wealth.

He's a good dude!

Ok, here's what I dun did!

Delegated an extra 100 SP to msp-creativebot in honor of @sammosk and his winning poem.
Delegated 100 Sp to @an0nkn0wledge
Delegated an additional 100 to @geke
Delegated 100SP to @isaria
Delegated 100 SP to @lordmok
Delegated 100 SP to @arbitrarykitten
Delegated 100 SP to @himshweta
Delegated 100 SP to @thepotato
Delegated 100 SP to @isohero

Here's proof of wut I dun did-

You guys can keep it until you're dolphins.  Then I'll take it back and give to some other minnow.

## Next contest <h2>

I need more memes in my life.  This is in part because many people on Steemit are currently deep in the Vietmeme war doing the best we can to show the idiocy, kleptography, insanity of what government does on a daily basis.  I want to make a meme the news post that's filled with minnow memes.  There's 500SP up for grabs minimum.  I reserve the right to double it.  Anything you post will be used in an upcoming Meme the News Post and you'll get credit for them.  Best meme(s) will be delegated at least 500SP, but I'm willing to increase if there are some really good ones.

To be clear.  Make a meme about the news.  Put it in this post in the comments!

Get to work guys!  

## These minnow delegations are part of my witness project <h2>

There are a few ways I can help this platform grow and retain users.  I'm forming communities to do that.  I'm supporting people to do that.  I'm supporting curation to do that.  These delegations are part of my Witness promise and I'm planning continue as long as I'm a witness.  As a top witness they'll come faster and bigger.  If you like the idea that someone that earns SP as a top witness is spending hours each week creating contests and evaluating good people and projects to delegate to then please support my Witness along with over 1100 other Steemians who vote for me.

If you'd like to support other people that support the Minnow Support Project please go to www.minnowsupport.org and check out the leadership tab.

If you are a whale and want to help minnows and grow the platform one great way is to delegate to @minnowsupport.  Here's an app that makes that simple-
