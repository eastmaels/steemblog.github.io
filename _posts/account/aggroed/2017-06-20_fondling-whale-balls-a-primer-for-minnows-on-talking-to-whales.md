There are 3.5 billion men.  Each day it seems one of them is successful with the line "Hey, baby wanna fuck?"  This is bad for all of humanity.  The people involved regret their actions.  Men think that they have a fighting chance with that line so it continues.  Women slut shame the fuck out of each other.  It's shitty and we all lose when it happens.

Similarly, when someone walks up to my steemit chat and posts hey F4F, as in follow for follow, I want to grab them by their balls or lady bits and toss them off a roof.  Yes, I started a Minnow Support Project for people that want to grow as a community, but those people want to work.  They respect that it takes time and effort to grow an account here.  These F4F people when it's from a minnow to a non-minnow don't have any respect for the work that it took to get here.  Maybe it actually works with larger accounts sometimes... but that makes me want to follower-shame the whale/dolphin that accepted the proposition.  Seriously, you're just encouraging this kinda shit.

## How should it be done? <h2>

First, if you're just starting out... you probably shouldn't talk to anyone other than another minnow.  Maybe that's too harsh, but it's better to be on the safe side.  Just watch and chill for a bit.  See how this community works.  When I start a new job I try not to say or do anything for 2 weeks.  Start getting a sense of the culture.  Things are probably done a certain way for a reason.  Just because you can't see the reason your first day there doesn't mean you should run your mouth.  Also, day 2 isn't the day to storm the boss's office declaring your manifesto for your new working environment.

## Second it's kinda like courtship <h2>

I'm in sales and I use a dating analogy for sales all the time.  For the genx-ers it's kinda like a man approaching a woman that's a little out of your league.  For the millennials, it's sorta like a vegan gender fluid pansexual fair trade shopper who self identifies as a hampster talking to an amorophous asexual hermphoditdic zombie self identifying as a dino fluffy.  You just don't walk up and say, "hey would you like to drop acid and molly in this cuddle puddle while we roll around stimulating genitals" while you're in a shopping mall dressed as people.

So, you have to be polite, be kind, and build a relationship.  If you start with hey can you upvote my post or something like that they'll likely ignore you.  If you have 2000 followers or 50k SP swingin' around maybe they'll take the call, but if you're looking for a handout with a person in a much stronger starting position I suggest something different.

## Find out what interests them <h2>

Don't come onto my wall and start posting how much you love the USG.  Don't tell me how you think we should invade more than the 7 coutries we're actively at war with or the many others we're occupying with military force.  It won't be well received.  I like Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  I spend my time growing active minnow posters.  If you read that and have something to offer in that arena if you if you don't have a lot of SP or followers I might entertain your stuff then.

## Say hi first, don't spam your shit, and figure out the rules by reading them somewhere <h2>

Everyone is welcome in the PALnet Discord channel.  It's a public channel run by 6 publicly elected witnesses.  We'd love to have you come in and say hi and get ot know us, but if you hop on link your post and ask for shit without anything else it's just kinda rude.  It's like interuptting a conversation among a set of girls and asking which one of them might care to blow you first.  It's rude.  Don't do it.

## If you want some attention start by following and commenting <h2>

Top posters are obsessive comment hounds.  We build  relationships.  That's how we'e grown, and it's usually best done in the comments section.  So, hop in a comment and drop a thoughtful something or a funny gif/meme.  Do that a couple times and then try to interact with us in a more direct way on steemitchat or discord.

## Breaking down the post name <h2>

Whale = rich person on Steemit
Whale balls= high SP 

fondle playing with or gently accessing.

Attempting to get gentle access to a large SP account through friendly interaction.
