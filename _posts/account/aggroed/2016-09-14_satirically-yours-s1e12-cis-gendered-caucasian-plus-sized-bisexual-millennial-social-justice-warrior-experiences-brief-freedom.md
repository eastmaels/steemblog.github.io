<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_insult">@fiercesjw</a> was able to take a peaceful stroll in the woods uninterrupted by over privileged cis white anglo saxon christian males who manspain, emit microaggressive racist remarks, while supporting institutional racism and rape culture by collective inaction towards common areas of equitable justice. &nbsp;The walk featured beautiful flowers-</p>

<p>but the highlight of the walk was in the solitude and physical separation from body shaming heteronormative misogynist patriarchal cis gendered men. &nbsp;The peaceful walk would eventually put her in a healthy state of mind to eat farm raised non-gmo gluten free fat free free range open pasture undyed humanely slaughtered vegan chicken. &nbsp;The ethically sourced meal would be especially good because the chicken was locally sourced from an organic fair trade certified sustainable carbon neutral chicken coop made from recycled freshly grown un-pasteurized bamboo. &nbsp;</p>
<p>She listened to nature sounds unimpeded by racially biased headphones produced by legendary misogynist rape culture enthusiast and physically abusive Dr. Dre with culturally unsound religiously intolerant marketing campaigns designed to disempower women produced from unethical labor conditions in third world countries.</p>
<p>All in all it turned out to be a great day.</p>
