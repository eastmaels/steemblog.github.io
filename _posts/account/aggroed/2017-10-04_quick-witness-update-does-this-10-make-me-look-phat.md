So, umm, kind of a big deal.  I hit Witness 10 tonight.  That's pretty freaking huge to me.  If I wasn't swamped in MSP stuff right now I'd be dancing in the streets.  There's over 1600 people that vote my Witness.  There's about 5000 people in the community I founded with @ausbitbank, @teamsteem, and @canadian-coconut.  It's come a long way, and I'm extremely grateful for the support.  We have just short of 600 separate delegations for around 200k steem (the largest is 15k SP).   We're still under four months.  So, feeling pretty good about what we're doing.

If you check my wallet you can see that I'm delegating almost everything I get from my witness back into the community.  I don't have a ton of time to curate since MSP keeps me so busy.  So, this is a way I can reward the community, help minnows, and provide incentives for things like radio show participation.

I recently changed my Sunday radio show format.  What started as a music show is now turning into a chance for anyone to come get 5 min on air with me.  So, get your mic, headset, and person into Discord then and feel free to ask me anything or promote what you want to.

Lovejuice went down for a bit.  Juice is my sexy little bidbot.  I ended up rebuiding it on a brand new server.  It's the first time I've been able to do that completely on my own.  I'm getting better at the technical side of things.  I'm still keeping up my promise to pay people 5SBD from the rewards to write erotica on there.  Posts there make under $1, so I'm still paying minnows more than I make from the post.  I'll keep doing that.  So if you want to get paid for a short erotica story send it my way in discord.

MSP is gonna have some big changes to announce pretty soon.  We're working on a governance update.  We're working on Community Standards.  We're working on solid rules.  So far it seems like we have some good foundations.  We're trying to position ourselves for growth, better organziation, and allowing more users to work with us.  So, stay tuned for that.  To be clear we're not changing the mission/charter at all though.  We're still spreading the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, helping the Steemit platform grow, and helping to train and retain minnows.  We're just tweaking how we do it cause we've learned a lot in the first 4 months we've been here and we're getting ready to retune and greatly expand operations and services.

Speaking of services... I'm looking into creating a new service called the Peace Academy.  We've developed a lot of tools and strats to help build communities, manage them, and peacefully interact with one another.  I'd like to help more people learn what acting peacefully, with ourselves and others, looks like, and I think the peace academy is the way to do that best.  Stay tuned.

I"m not running an RPC node directly, but I'm following the lead of witness combo @followbtcnews and @crimsonclad, and helping to contribute to that as time and free sbd permit.

## Technical stuff <h2>

What's a witness?  Well, there are two forms.  One is a server that builds the blockchain from all the actions you do on it.  One is a person that operates the server.  My server settings haven't really changed for a while.  Account creation fee is stable, my pricefeed died briefly on my backup witness server, but it's backup and running.  I missed 4 blocks last week, so my total is up to 5.  I have a negligible interest on SBD.  Things seem pretty healthy especially with polo back.  My primary server is hosted through @privex in Germany and my backup is in the US also with @privex.

I'm not effing around on my primary server.  Here are some specs for it.

- 32gb DDR4 RAM
 - Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz
 - 1gbit/s network Germany 
 - 2x500gb SSDs

## Special Thanks <h2>
In addition to the witness voters, MSP cofounders, witnesses, moderators, delegators, members, and visitors, I want to give one special note of thanks to @timcliff.  I wouldn't have even gotten close to top 10 if it wasn't for your help.  Thank you!  Many minnows now benefit because of your help, and I strive to be a better witness every day.  I continue to look up to you and thank you for your help.
