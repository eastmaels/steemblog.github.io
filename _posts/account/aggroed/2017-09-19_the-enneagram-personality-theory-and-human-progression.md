If you've been on Steemit for a while you've probably been to the Steemspeak channel that @fyrstikken manages.  If you've been there you have probably seen a bunch of people in Discord with names like Billy [INTJ}.  The letters are a personality classification system called Myers Briggs.  I have liked that system for a while.  I'm an ENTP; the Inventor.  Actually, it's only 1-2% of the population, but it seems like they are everywhere on Steemit and makes me feel a little less like an alien on this planet.

## Myers Briggs, the good <h2>

I like the system, and I think it does a nicce job putting people in some rough buckets according to how they are likely to behave.  It's useful when trying to predict people's actions.  I lie these classication systems, but one of the things it's missing is "When an ENTP is healthy they tend to do X, and when they are unhealthy they tend towards Y."  Shit like that can be helful to guide people in their lives and use some general guidelines to track their development.  

## Enneagram <h2>

This baby has a pretty good chart and system for personality clarification.  I'm an 8.  If you read about them you may not be surprised by it.  I feel it's done a good job describing me for a while, but it also gives me something to aspire to.  8s tend towards 2s when they are at their best.  They give freely and work to help and promote others.  That sound familiar at all?  Anyway, its not a thing I reference daily on myself, but it is something I like to pay attention to every now and again.

Here's a good page to source stuff.  https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/how-the-enneagram-system-works/  Some pages and books will specificially talk about relationships between people and how playing off another will bring out our best and worst and what to look for in that regard.

Anyway, thoughts on how to grow as a person or help the peeps in my digital homestead grow is nearly always on my mind, so I thought I'd share this gem and trust the universe to deliver it to the right people that may need it right now to guide them.
