Please find below a 1 hour orientation that I hosted inside the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network to discuss Steemit and describe the Minnow Support Project.  We talk about community accounts, programs, people, community, roles, and a ton of stuff.  hopefully this helps you understand what we're doing here!  I know an hour is a little long, but we had just shy of 40 people in there trying to figure out Steemit and MSP.  

## MSP Waves <h2>

This was a live broadcast through mspwaves.com, and this is the recording from the show!  You'll notice there's a live discussion going on.  Throughout the show we had 60-70 people come through.  We capped just under 40 at any given time (which means @crimsonclad still holds the record for most concurrent listeners on air).  The radio show that followed was pretty good too, but I still have to process some of those clips and interviews.  That show was the Minnow Mayor Town Hall and it has 10 interviews during it!

Anyway, thanks for checking out the video.  If you're not already please think about joining PALnet.  It's literally the best thing you can do to help
