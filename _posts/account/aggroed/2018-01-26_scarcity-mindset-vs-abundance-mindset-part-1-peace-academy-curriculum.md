Scarcity Mindset vs. Abundance Mindset // Part 1

### Scarcity Mindset

 A scarcity mindset involves a deep belief that there will never be enough…..that there aren’t enough resources for everyone….and that life is a struggle…that we must constantly “fight” for resources.
This mindset results in fear, anxiety, and stress, which ultimately breeds more of the same.

Everything is energy, including our thoughts.
When you vibrate with low, negative energy, you attract more of the same into your life.

A scarcity mindset will not only negatively affect your thoughts and emotions, it can also impact your life on a physical and spiritual level as well.

If you are already experiencing scarcity, it is difficult to break out of this mindset, but it is possible.
We may not be able to immediately change our external circumstances.
But each of us has the power to change our external self…our mindset.
Shifting to an abundance mindset will result in positive external changes.

### Abundance Mindset

An abundance mindset comes from a deeply held belief that there is enough for everyone……money, resources, opportunities, health, etc.
It involves not living in fear and instead taking risks to achieve goals by reaching out of your comfort zone in order to grow.
It is living with a feeling of gratitude for what you have and what you will have.
It is giving freely, knowing that there is always enough for everyone.
Energy is an input/output system. 
It must flow.
The more you give, the more you will receive.

### Different Viewpoints Bring Different Results

An abundance mindset sees someone else’s success in a positive way thinking…
“Wow, I can be successful too.”
While a scarcity mindset views someone else’s success with envy and might even see it as their own failure.
As if there is a limited resource of “success”.
But, it is important to remember that someone else’s success is not your failure.
We all have the opportunity to succeed in our own ways

Another key difference is that an abundance mindset vibrates positive energy which returns more positivity.
A scarcity mindset not only attracts more negativity, but it can also create self-fulfilling prophecies and  a victim mindset where one may blame others instead of taking responsibility for their own choices.

A scarcity mindset might focus on how there aren't enough common resources for everyone.  An abundance mindset focuses on how substitutes may be found.

Truly woo: You're probably think that the external world is what impacts your internal mindset.  I can't argue it.  What I've come to accept is that this is a holographic universe and what we think and feel will be reflected back at us.  Some call this karma and others the law of attraction.  While many think that what you think is secondary to the world at large I happen to think that what you think and feel is highly likely to shape the world around you.  That's a hard dose for anyone to swallow that isn't familiar with this way of thinking, but if you're having trouble with it start by running small experiments with an abundance mindset over a period of a month or two.

A simple experiment is where you constantly say in your head "I don't  have enough of X" I'd encourage you to think to yourself "I do have enough of X" try to get a sense of what that feels like to you and then try to hold that space spiritually and energetically.  This is undoubtably woo-woo land, but if you're constantly finding yourself in a scarcity mindset never with enough and you're unwilling to change your mindset or beliefs my only question is "how's that working out for ya?"
