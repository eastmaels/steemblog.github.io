@ned says the plan is to have over 100k new businesses start up using the Steem blockchain.  Some of these will be revolutionary new blockchain companies.  Others will be traditional businesses that incorporate Steem payments.  Today I'm happy to introduce you to Eye Heart Organic.

## A homestead, farm stand, and grow op <h2>

These guys are still in their business infancy at this one business location so it's not going to knock your socks off just yet, but you can see it.  The guy talking is @movement19 and the website is: https://eyeheartorganic.wordpress.com/

There is a main farm house, a big barn with an attached greenhouse, and a second greenhouse under partial construction.  The plan is to grow seedlings in the attached greenhouse, grow organic food and the legal limit of medical marijuana plants in the second greenhouse, have a small aquaponics setup in the garage of the barn that also will double as a farmstand. 

They'll take food from other vendors in the area and sell in the common area.

They also want to sponsor various events.  They'll have a cannabis hang out lounge that's part of the facility.  it seems like a good time all around.

## The farm was preexisting, but in handyman shape <h2>

There's 4 kids on the property.  They are all being unschooled there.  Here are folks working on the barn.  Still a little time before planting the seedlings starts so they have some time to finish up.

They are building organic grow beds.  The plan is to have the soil take care of itself through good planting and rotation rather than simply dumping chemicals in to replenish the soil they remove all the nutrients from.

The sceneary is pretty nice.  They have a stream literally right behind the property.  It makes me a little nervous with kids, but there are a fair number of adults and children on the property and people have managed to live by rivers for eons without all the kids dying.

Here's a picture of the farmhouse with some of the mini vehicles that are on the property.  Kids are playing non stop inside and outside.  It's nice to see how the old farm houses were probably run.

This is the garage.  It's going to host the aquaponics facility and also the farm stand.  It's a good mix.  People will want to see the fishies and start asking questions like "what's the fish and vegetables doing together?"

I got a bit of the shakes so the focus sucks, but here's the attached greenhouse that they got.  It's a little small but should work great as a little nursery to get them started.  It's March, but it was warm in there.

## Taking Steem <h2>

This project have @movement19 as the VP of marketing for the project.  He's a Steemian.  The plan is to accept Steem for what they sell and barter, or for memberships for growop side of things.  So, to me this represents a pretty unique business that's a testament to the Liberty future and a throwback to the healthy past.  We have a multi-family homestead, creating a sustainable zero waste farm using up to date organic farming techniques and aquaponics.  They are going to accept the people's currency ie cryptocurrency, and they are pushing the business limits by running a growop at the same time.  

So, here we go.  Here's your future headed throwback small business that's going to help power the Steem economy.  I'm looking forward to supporting them as they get crops up and running.  As I learned from Steemit it should be "soon."

## Witness work <h2>

I'm not programmer.  I do manage some program work to help make tools that enable community building, but the community building itself is my witness agenda.  This is a good example.  If you think that bringing a small organic farming business to the Steem ecosystem is helpful for our community at large then please consider voting for me.  This is my commitment:

I promise to help spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.
To help grow the Steem ecosystem.
To train and retain minnows on the platform.
