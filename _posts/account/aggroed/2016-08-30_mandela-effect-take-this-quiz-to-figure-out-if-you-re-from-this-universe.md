<p>The Mandela Effect is the difference between the recollection of a large portion of the population and what written records show actually happened. &nbsp;These come in lots of variety.<br>
<br>
1. Movie Quotes</p>
<p>2. Historical Changes</p>
<p>3. Religious Changes</p>
<p>4. Geographical Changes</p>
<p>5. Changes to Physical Products</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Here's a short <a href="http://goo.gl/Q1KIRf">quiz </a>that will show you some of the effects you may have been exposed to and help determine if you are originally from this exact universe or somehow it's different.</p>
