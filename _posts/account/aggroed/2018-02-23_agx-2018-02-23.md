https://agx123.herokuapp.com//2018-02-23.jpg<br/><br/>This is the daily AgX chart for today 2018-02-23.<br/>Today's 200 day moving average is 0.92 for a STEEM/SBD ratio of 0.89.<h3>What is AgX?</h3><br/><br/>The Mayer's multiple (200 days moving average of the BTC/USD price) is known to be a good indicator of the BTC price evolution.
AgX aims to be a similar indicator regarding the STEEM/SBD ratio, in order for users to find the right moment to exchange their SBD for STEEM at the best possible rate.

Historically a good time to sell steem for SBD is when the blue line is at the top of the chart, and it's a good time to sell SBD for Steem when the blue line is at the bottom of the chart.  

I originaly intended to take this off my wall today, but I'm not planning on moving it Saturday or Sunday to @agx.
