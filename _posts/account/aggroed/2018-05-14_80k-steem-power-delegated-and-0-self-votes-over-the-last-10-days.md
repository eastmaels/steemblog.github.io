So, this morning I delegated another 2,000 SP to @msp-waves.  It's an account that's used to upvote DJs on the the MSP-Waves radio station we built inside of the [Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network](minnowpond.org).

The addition brought my delegation to over 9k there.  Let's look at my overall delegation amounts.

To turn those number into SP divide by 2 and multiply by 1000.

So, basically my biggest delegations are to

@lovejuice- 15k it's a bid bot where a lot of the profits goes to pay new authors on the platform to write original content.
@msp-curation 12k - Manually curated Steem curation by a team of roughly a dozen people
@msp-active- 10k Support active members of the Minnow Support Project and PALnet by upvoting their posts.
@msp-wave- 9.5 help the radio station grow it's account, pay DJ, and pay it's server cots
@msp-lovebot- 9k Give a little love back to people that delegate to various MSP projects and accounts
@msp-bidbot- a tiny bid bot that gives 5% rewards back to @minnowsupport and otherwise gives back to the delegators
@msp-mods 4k- an account that upvotes moderator and witness accounts from MSP

## 64,500 SP!!!

Ok, then on top of that I'm delegating to some good people and projects around the block.  That makes up for the other 16,000.  I don't think that everyone has to delegate back to the community or selflessly vote on the platform, but I think it's important and it's something that I'm working on.

The USD value of that is 240k!  All the curation rewards from that are going back to the community.

## Self votes?

I do support @minnowsupport and @msp-waves with autovotes.  I don't take rewards out of it and I use the funds to give back to the community... so I don't think that counts as self-voting, but you be the judge.  It's about 8% of the votes I use because I hit them with 100% votes when they post.

I'm not going to promise to never self vote, but for now I'm following the example set by @ausbitbank and others to curate through a combination of manual and automatic means to encourage growth on the platform.


## Anyway(s), transparency as a witness is important

My main contribution continues to be running the Minnow Support Project and heading up the radio station inside of it.  It builds community and keeps people on the blockchain and interacting.   Can't moon without people!  I'm going to be doing another scavenger hunt soon to encourage folks to write 1M Steem account articles and post them places.  That should be fun if a little expensive...
