So, as with every Sunday night we're gonna be in PALnet talking away about the Steem stuff.  So, come show up, hang out, and have some fun.

Show starts in 15 minutes.  Anyone is welcome on air to introduce themselves or a project or talk about whatever they'd like.

join us in Discord at http://minnowpond.org or online at mspwaves.com/listen
