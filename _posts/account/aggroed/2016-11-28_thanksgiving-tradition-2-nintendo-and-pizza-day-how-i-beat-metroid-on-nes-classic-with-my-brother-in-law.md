<p>I wrote about my first thanksgiving tradition, which is to say one thing I'm thankful for on Thanksgiving. &nbsp;The following days normally have a second tradition called Nintendo and Pizza. &nbsp;This weekend while my brother in law visited we decided to uphold the old tradition after the NES classic came out.</p>

<p>Oh, you don't have one... I'm very sorry to hear that. &nbsp;Anyway, I do! &nbsp;We decided to go on a Metroid spree-</p>

<p>Classic fun. &nbsp;We started by trying to play legit, but we realized that the map is so large that it's too hard to remember for the short amount of time we had. &nbsp;So we busted out the map.</p>

<p>with the map in hand he navigated while I played. &nbsp;I strongly suggest getting the armor early and skipping wave gun. &nbsp;We finished the game in a little over 5 hours. &nbsp;So we got ending two.</p>

<p>she waved in ours.</p>
