There's lot of reasons to join the PALnet Discord server.  We have around 200k SP from almost 600 delegators in community accounts that can upvote minnow posts.  We can help you listen to tunage as we have a killer radio station called mspwaves.  We can help you find a community, because with 5,000 people there's something for everyone.  Though that said, one of my current favorite things to do is battle some fools in the Epic Rap Battle channel in PALnet.

## @GoldenArms <h2>

Recently a new edition to the channel decided to come at yours truly.  It's a little bizarre, but he's the best Canadian rapper I've ever heard of...  Anyway, he came at me in the channel.  You can find us battling in here: https://discord.gg/ZZvKUMJ.  I have no regrets.  I did what I had to do.  I present "Dinosaur."

## Dinosaur <h2>

All right goldenarms I admit you’re the best!  But only if standard’s a Great Wall of text.
We’ve made many advances like even return key! Let's go canada!  Join this cen-tur-y.

And now you talk big bout being a lion, I lie in wait for lion I’m spying, 
you talkin’ all grand like a big of man of war.  Fuck it I’ll go straight dinosaur.

Your verbiage is weak you need a thesaurus while you do that I’m stegosaurus.
I was sitting there chilling eating some grain but now that I’m aggroed I’m stomping your brain.

You’ve started as lion and seem quite perplex, I think that’s quite normal as I’m now T-Rex. 
Mufasa just told you of “all that light touch.“ I ate him too didn’t fill me that much.

I’m sure that by now your whole pride is in peril; bad time to share I’m now pterodactyl?
Spreading my wings I’m lord of the air, eating your Family like I doesn’t care.

Ok, for fun, I’ll retro Zeus god'a'thunda, and lyrically smack you back you to the tundra.
