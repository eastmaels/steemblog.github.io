We've talked before about the lack of transparency and even outright lies told by the mainstream media. 
More and more people are waking up to this fact as it is public knowlege that roughly 90% of the mainstream media is owned by only 6 corporations.

What many still have a hard time accepting is the idea that keeping the general public in the dark is purposely by design and extends beyond our media into our very school systems.

The Deep State is a prime example of information that has been purposely withheld from the public.

# Q-Web by Dylan Louis Monroe

[Dylan Louis Monroe](https://www.dylanlouismonroe.com/q-web.html) created a Deep State Mapping Project.  One of his maps, which he calls the Q-Web, is a chronological timeling of key moments in history which have been hidden from the public.
The timeline includes government operations, de-classified information, lies that have been told by mainstream media, and occult practices by world leaders.
