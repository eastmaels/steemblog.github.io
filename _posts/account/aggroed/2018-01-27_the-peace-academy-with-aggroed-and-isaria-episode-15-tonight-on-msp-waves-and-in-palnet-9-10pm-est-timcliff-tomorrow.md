# The Peace Academy with @aggroed and @isaria: Episode 15 Tonight on MSP-Waves and in PALnet! (9-10PM EST, 0200 UTC)


Our curriculum this week focused on Scarcity Mindset vs. Abundance Mindset.



It is a common belief that our thoughts and feelings are only reactions to what is going on externally in our lives, as if we have no control over our mindset.

So for some, it can be difficult to grasp the concept that our thoughts and feelings can shape the world around us.

But we can control what is happening within us through shifting our mindset from one of scarcity to one of abundance, which will ultimately affect our external lives in a positve manner.

We need to work through necessary negative emotions in order to have emotional balance, but we don't need to hold onto negative thoughts that do not serve us.

Rejecting unnecessary negative thoughts and replacing them with a more positive mindset is a great first step.

For example, instead of dwelling on the lack of money in your bank account, focus on what you do have, and what you will have with feelings of gratitude on a daily basis.

We'll talk more about this on the show tonight.

## I'm also very excited to announce @timcliff is coming on the Minnow Mayor Town Hall tomorrow night! <h2>

Tim is really my Witness mentor and I'm very excited to bring him onto the Minnow Mayor Town Hall Show Tomorrow Night.  Tim is often found in the top 4 witness spots, the help chat, and aiding people all across this chain and helping to change code to change for everyone's betterment.  We're lucky to have him on the block and I'm excited to share he'll be on my show.
