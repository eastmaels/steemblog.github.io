# <center> Show Highlights  </center>

Our discussion during episode 14 revolved around Abundance.
We talked a bit about last weekend's Steemit Growth Forum on Msp-Waves, Distribution of Steem, and how you can grow on Steemit as a new user.

## Steem Witness Forum
Many of the top 20 witnesses joined Aggroed during the last growth forum.

They all agreed that the biggest problem with Steemit is the sign up process.

They talked about some technological hurdles that we may encounter in the next few years.
All the apps on the blockchain go through RPC nodes which take an enormous amount of RAM to run.
We are growing by 1 GB per day, but we will start growing faster.
Eventually we will need 2 TB servers which will be extremely expensive unless we find alternatives.

They also discussed the rise of SBD.
Most witnesses are holding on to the idea that 1 SBD should be pegged to 1 USD.
Aggroed thinks that the free market should decide the value of SBD instead of forcing the peg.

## Steemt Inc., Steemit, and Steem
These are 3 different things that are constantly confused together.

* Steemit Inc is the blockchain development company that develops for steemit.com (condenser) and for the steem blockchain (hard forks)
* Steemit is the website
* Steem is the actual Blockchain

## Distribution

![Distribution.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcN5DLson3TCPp33Foi5KRHmLjMLXvncdhAUWsC6voD3s/Distribution.png)
This is a few month old snap shot of distribution.


The distribution of Steem is a huge problem, but there are a couple of solutions that may work to even out the distribution.

As the price goes up, developers will likely sell and cash out, at which point minnows will have a chance to buy more steem if they can afford it.

Another idea is regarding platform inflation.
It's generally around 10% every year.
We get to decide where it goes with our upvotes as opposed to Stake weighted inflation, where the only people that benefit are the people with the most steem.

## How can you grow on Steemit as a new user?

Someone from the audience asked how we can grow with the distribution being what it is.
The best way to grow is to interact on the blockchain and within the MSP Palnet Discord to build relationships and network.
Itâ€™s a very slow process, but consistency is key.
Commenting and posting every day while creating a niche will help you gain and retain followers.
