The following is the recorded broadcast of the Peace Academy.  A show hosted by me, @aggroed, and @isaria. 
 Here's a description of what takes place during the show:

Aggroed talks a little bit about some of the hardship of his life.  He talks about he made some poor decisions that hurt people due to some extreme external distress, and how he came to find the non-aggression principle, how to lead a life of peace, a little dip into the woo, and some life experiences of how the quantum nature of the world makes us all progress through levels.  We see this in growth of people, growth of currencies, heights of young children.  Life happens in spurts as if new quantum levels are reached.
