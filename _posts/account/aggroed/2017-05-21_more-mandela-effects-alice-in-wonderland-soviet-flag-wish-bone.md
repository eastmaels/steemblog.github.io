You ever heard of the Mandela Effect?  It's a really weird phenomena.  I've been studying it heavily since July of 2015.  The origin of the name stems from people who recall the same story in great detail about Nelson Mandela dying in prison, the riots that occured afterward, and how they had a ceremony in school or news played on the radio... except, it never happened.  Nelson Mandela became President of South Africa and died years later (no longer in prison).

Many of these Mandela Effects are known.  I have a quiz with around ~50k takers that show a strong bias towards something very bizarre.  People with extremely accurate memories remember a different sequence of events... in some cases so does the vast majority of the population.  Take these quizes to see which ones effect you.  The shortest is the first one.  The middle is a middle length one.  The last one is a doozy.

Here's an image from Alice in Wonderland.

It freaks me out because I know they had little twirly beanies on their head.  I remember owning a beanie with a twirly like the ones they had, but now they have flags... It's not like the movie has been remastered... In this reality they have Flags.

How about this one of the old communist flag.  Do you remember the star?  The star I associate with China.  This was never there for me.

What about the name of this dressing.

VinAIgrette?  it's supposed to be an E not an AI.  Totally weird.

I think we're in a matrix.  I think the matrix changes around us.  I think the Mandela Effect is evidence of that.  I just don't know why it's changing.
