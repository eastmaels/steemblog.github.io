Good Morning!  I'm excited to report that in 11hrs from now @timcliff, @theywillkillyou, and @world5list will all be on the Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  The show starts at 8pm est 0100 UTC.

@timcliff if one of the Top Witnesses on the platform.  A Witness is a server that builds the blockchain and the person who runs it.  The Witnesses provide technical and social services to the platform and Tim does both.  He's constantly helping people on steemit.chat and he's known for putting together projects with large scope to look for ways to improve the blockchain from user experience and then get them implemented.  We'll spend some time talking about the blockchain as a whole and probably diving into some certain topics which may or may not include the conversion of Steem back in SBD.

@theywillkillyou and @world5list manage two youtube channels by the same name with a combined 1.8M subscribers.  They are on a Steem fueled kick to reimagine some of the content they produce, how they monitize, and get back to stories that YouTube would demonetize, but Steem will make sure they get paid for.  It's an exciting time to watch how successful YouTubers even with 5 years+ of history on YouTube can see brighter pathways forward.

## Panel Discussions <h2>

I'm getting ready to announce a February line up of Forums/Panel Discussions.  This is highly subject to change.

Intro to Crypto Trading- Feb 3
of Steem- Feb 10
Women of Steem aka Steem Queens - Feb 17 (cohost @crimsonclad, @stellabelle and @surfermarly confirmed)
Steem Witness Panel - Feb 24
Artists of Steem- March 3
Musicians of Steem- March 10 (this is hopefully a live performance show. Working on it.)

All panels will occur at 11am EST (1600 UTC) in the [PALnet Discord](minnowpond.org), they will be recorded and broadcast on mspwaves.com, and those recordings will be put on @aggroed.

## Show Format <h2>

These are invited guests.  After the guests have had a chance to speak I'll go back to the normal format of giving time to whoever would like to come on to talk about whatever they would like.  I base time decisions on how many people are in the waiting room.  So if you'd like to make sure you get some time to talk hop into Discord and listen to the show in the waiting room.

## Logistics <h2>

## Onair guideline <h2>
This is do no harm, but take no shit land.  As long as you're not intentionally being malicious you can say whatever you want.  If you cross the line to personal attacks you'll likely get booted.
