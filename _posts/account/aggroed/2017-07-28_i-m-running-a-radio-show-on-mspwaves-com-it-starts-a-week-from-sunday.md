This is a quick PSA to let folks know that starting a week from this Sunday I'm going to be hosting a radio show in the PALnet Discord Chatroom on Sunday evenings from 8pm-10pm NYC time.  It's called Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  It's just meant to be a Q&A session with some funny anecdotes tossed in there. 

## Why we started this <h2>

There are tons of people with lots of good ideas, but it's hard to get them out there.  You need to interact with folks and form community in order to get things accomplished.  The radio station is aimed at pulling people together and getting to work.  Some of this is just to foster a sense of community, some is to share news, and some to make friends.  I continue wanting to support the values of peace, abundance, and liberty.  This seems like a way to make connections, spread Steemit, and get the word out.

## Pretty likely I'll use the word bankster at some point! <h2>

Yeah, just a heads up, pretty negative thoughts on the world's economic systems.  that will likely get some airtime.

## Please join me and other MSP show hosts <h2>
