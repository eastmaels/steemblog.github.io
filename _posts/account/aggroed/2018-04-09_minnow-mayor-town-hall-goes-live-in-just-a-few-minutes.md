hey party people.  I'm happy to declare that the Minnow Mayor Town Hall goes on as scheduled.  We're going to be to be talking with some of my favorite people on the block this evening!  You!  That's right, the Minnow Mayor Town Hall is a radio show dedicated to you and for you.  This way you can ask whatever you want, promote whatever you want, share whatever you want, and I'm happy to indulge you!

## Logistics!

Starts in 10 min!  

All you have to do is hop into [The Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel](minnowpond.org).

Once you're there scroll down the list of chatrooms a little and you'll see a bunch of people in a live audience channel chatting and listening.  You can be one of them!

## Delegation

Don't really do it anymore, but you can get a spot on msp-active if you think you're an active participant in the community, but don't get votes or only small votes right now.

## Dice Bitches!

That's right 25 SBD up for grabs!  You're not gonna wanna miss it.  I'll explain how it works once you're there.

## Requirements to speak

Everyone can get 5 min at least that wants it up until I'm too tired for more chit chat
You just need a mic and a headset (earbuds ok, just don't want speaker noise going back to your mic)
Follow the Server community guidelines, which basically means don't intentionally be a dick to me, guests, Steemit, or peopel on the platform.
