I don't know a lot of guys renting magic decks.  it's too risky.  The stranger might run off with them.  With blockchain assets and delegation you don't have to worry about it.  It's all on the blockchain!  Because we eliminated the need for trust we can have a great rental market rolling!

Did you guys know you can rent cards with Splinterlands?  It's been going on for a while.  I'm 1/3 rented and making a 12% ROI on my cards.  It's the ultimate passive income!  it's also great for the game because it helps lower the cost barrier to get new players in the game.  But not many people seem to know it's happening!

## What does renting mean in this context?

It's like delegation.  I keep ownership but let others use it.  Here I own the cards and I'm letting other people rent them from me.

## How to rent?

Yabapmatt wrote up the ability to rent cards through a decentralized process, but didn't add a UI for it in the game.  If you'd like to rent a card or lease one out you have to find someone who wants the cards socially or you can go to peakmonsters.com

To rent head on down to peakmonsters.com, click market, choose rental, and be sure to look at a variety of card types (alpha, betas, gold, promos, rewards)

If you see cards you like you can rent them.

## Why do this?
Every match you win you can earn DEC.
Every day you can win a quest and get cards.
Every Season you can earn lots of cards.
Every day there's a minimum of 3 tournaments that can be free to enter.

There's lots of ways to earn by playing.

In terms of how much you have to stake it's a lot less upfront if you're renting rather than buying.

## Time vs Money

It's hard to find people with a lot of money and time.
It's easier to find people with just time or just money.

Renting cards makes it so some people can own and rent and others can play but not own.
