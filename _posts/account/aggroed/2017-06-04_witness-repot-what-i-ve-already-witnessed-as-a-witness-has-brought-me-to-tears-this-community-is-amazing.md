I wanted to share some of what's in a block and a few posts that my witness helped put on the blockchain!  The idea was @ausbitbank 's and I'm so grateful I started looking.  Here's the page where you can find the blocks I witnessed.

I didn't know what to expect.  A few votes?  A reply or something.  What I found was absolutely astounding.

Here's the page showing the block I witnessed.  https://steemdb.com/block/12449949

You'll notice it's a response to @bethyi 's first post- https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@bethyi/my-name-is-beth-and-i-want-to-die

You can see the response by @skycornish that my witness put on the block.

I have multiple friends that have committed suicide, and knowing that my witness has helped one community member support another through their emotional struggle of this magnitude is incredibly touching to me.  I didn't write the message, but because of the witness that I run this message got sent.  I am so thankful and simply filled with gratitude to this community for supporting one another and allowing me to be a part of it.  

@bethyi I want you to know you're loved, you're supported, and we're glad you're here.  I'm following and I look forward to your posts.  Please write at least once a day for a little bit so we know you're ok.  Stay strong!
