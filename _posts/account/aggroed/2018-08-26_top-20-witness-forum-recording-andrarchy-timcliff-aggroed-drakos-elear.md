Here's the Steem Witness Forum Video.  Had a great discussion around HF20 and what's coming, culture of Steemit, and what the various witnesses are working on.  

Thanks @andrarchy for joining us and giving us the update from the Steemit perspective.


Starts right now!  We'll be joined by @timcliff, @aggroed, @pgarcgo, @drakos, and @elear.  I'm typing while on air!
