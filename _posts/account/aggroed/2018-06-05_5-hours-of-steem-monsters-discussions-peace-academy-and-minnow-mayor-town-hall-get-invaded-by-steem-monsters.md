Hey folks.  Normally I would do these as two separate posts, but I'm so slammed and tired it's hard to imagine cranking both of them out right meow.  I haven't been this exhausted since my last year of grad school while writing my dissertation.  I thought I was busy before Steem Monsters launched.  That pace would feel like a vacation.  It's a wonderful problem to have and one I'm grateful for.  I mean... we've sold about $50k worth of Monsters in the first 10 days.  That's pretty incredible.   You being stoked makes us more stoked.

## Peace Academy <h2>

The first video is the peace academy.  We have a discussion here about how we're going to put the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty and weave them into the game.  We have a bit of an esoteric adventure figuring out how that might happen and what it's going to look like.  Good times!

## Minnow Mayor Town Hall

This is 3.5 hours of discussion around steem monsters.  We continue the story crafting of Steem Monsters in the first part of the show, and later @yabapmatt comes on and we discuss how to setup some standard rules for how the stats will operate.  If you're looking for more detail on rule mechanics we're passionately discussing them in the second half of the show.
