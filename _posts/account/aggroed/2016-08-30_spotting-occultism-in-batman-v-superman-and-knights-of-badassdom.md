<p>Can we talk about some really weird and esoteric shit for a moment? &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/50c1368631.jpg" width="1920" height="999"/></p>
<p>So, above is a Screen Shot from Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice 2016 Extended Ultimate Edition. &nbsp;Now, I don't know about you, but that thing looks a lot like what I think satan is supposed to look like. &nbsp;Giant horns. &nbsp;Weird eyes. &nbsp;Floating black cube thingies. &nbsp;Christ like dude in the blood water for some ritualistic baptism. &nbsp;That looks like some weird occult shit. &nbsp;It's totally freaky. &nbsp;It's also not even the bad guy. &nbsp;It just makes a quick cameo in the movie.</p>
<p>So, I went down this rabbit hole. &nbsp;Honestly, I've been down a lot of rabbit holes. &nbsp;Some of my buddies think I've lost it a little bit, but hopefully some randos on the internet will hear me out.</p>
<p>I was listening to an interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUGAkBTVShM">Fade to Black with Jimmy Black</a>. &nbsp;He was interviewing David Wilcock. &nbsp;David talks about a lot of stuff, but in regard to this article he was talking about occult and Luciferian messaging in Batman V Superman. &nbsp;David says puts some of the following statements together to&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Jesse Eisenberg plays Lex Luther. &nbsp;Lex Luther is how they (the occult) see Jesus Christ... &nbsp;He's the guy trying to detonate the illuminati. &nbsp;(He cuts his hand, his blood goes in the Kryptonian cadaver to make a monster.) The monster has a glowing heart, which is the glowing heart of christ. &nbsp;They see it as a demon. &nbsp;(You later see his cut hand with his bloody palm, so they are not being subtle). &nbsp;They have a picture of Lucifer in the movie as a fallen angle.</p>
<p><img src="https://geekiversedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gphds8i-copy.jpg" width="1852" height="2544"/></p>
<p>Eisenberg says himself during the movie while looking at that picture: "The devil's don't come from hell beneath us. &nbsp;No, they come from the sky."</p>
<p>He talks about Superman and Batman actually being aspects of Lucifer as in both represent Lucifer. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mVP5YZNe2p0/VTHESQ9cK1I/AAAAAAAAXlA/N6advMYHzQo/s1600/Batman%2Bvs%2BSuperman%2Bglowing%2Beyes.jpg" width="1600" height="691"/></p>
<p>In their version Lucifer defeats Christ and his glowing heart monster</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/51f5b63a8c.jpg" width="1911" height="861"/></p>
<p>and then sends Christ to prison.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/513777f253.jpg" width="1729" height="817"/></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Well, ok, this explanation makes some sense to me, but where else can I see it? &nbsp;A buddy of mine who likes D&amp;D said go watch Knights of Badassdom. &nbsp;The movie is horrible all around, but it follows a&nbsp;similar pattern. &nbsp;It's an occult version of the killing of Jesus hidden in a terrible movie about Larping in the woods.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>They summon a bad girl from a parallel universe that turns into a giant demon monster.</p>
<p><img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/96cd95d10610f4186a0f4322e4118013/tumblr_n14hjiZ68w1sjuk9jo1_1280.jpg" width="960" height="1280"/></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The monster is crucified.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/516d8a3f9d.jpg" width="1443" height="661"/></p>
<p>Then he's stabbed while crucified.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/5178b90d71.jpg" width="1403" height="731"/></p>
<p>The hero sings a ritualistic death metal song.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/51899c1f44.jpg" width="1455" height="685"/></p>
<p>The lyrics I can hear are "Cast down into thine dark crypt. &nbsp;Shadows of our dead minions drag. &nbsp;Thee into the abyss. &nbsp;(His soul) Rises bringing his deadliest gifts. &nbsp;His soul is devoured in wrath. (something about a chosen one while his friends talk over him singing) His dreams are and yet twisted. &nbsp;in blood red eclyspe He is reborn in the dark light. &nbsp;He instigates they doom. &nbsp;Ravens wings turn the sky to black. &nbsp;As he makes this world thy tomb.</p>
<p>This is when he summons a previously dead minion.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/51bd689f2e.jpg" width="1473" height="627"/></p>
<p>The song continues</p>
<p>Lifeless husk. &nbsp;From you raise you blade defeat. &nbsp;The vile snake your heart. &nbsp;His wings turn the sky to black as he makes this world thy tomb.</p>
<p>The minion attacks relentlessly.</p>
<p><img src="https://toomanyposts.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/kob-dinklage-comeback.jpg" width="584" height="271"/></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The monster dies.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/51c9da6942.jpg" width="1479" height="653"/></p>
<p>and the minion vanishes.</p>
<p>The lyrics continue</p>
<p>Made a sacrifice of my soul</p>
<p>before a blazing funeral pyre for you.</p>
<p>The monster really dies completely, and the heroes say drop to the nether realms, bitch.</p>
<p>The girlfriend says ""You have questionable taste in women." &nbsp;which is a reference to the story where the monster came from a succubus that resembled his girlfriend, but also seems linked to an emasculation of Jesus.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So, that's my dose of weird occult imagery in modern movies depicting Christ as the monster, Lucifer as the savior, and is clearly a weird distortion of the stories you may have read about in the Bible etc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Itt makes me want to revisit the weird dance from when they opening the big sweedish tunnel and it was clearly another weird occult ritual dance.</p>

<p>So, when folks tell you that Hollywood has some weird satanic shit. &nbsp;Well, here's a few places to start your search.</p>
<p>Other than that these movies were fun to watch.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Bear-McCreary-feat-Brendan-McCreary-Brendon-Small/Your-Heart-Sucks-My-Soul">Lyrics </a>I found online are: &nbsp;</p>
<p>A sacrifice of my soul,&nbsp;</p>
<p>before A blazing funeral pile for you&nbsp;</p>
<p>A thousand deaths and I'd suffer more</p>
<p>Eternal cold forever yours &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ye enemy Hellspawn &nbsp;</p>
<p>Cast down into thine dark crypt</p>
<p>&nbsp;Shadows of our dead minions&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drag me into the abyss&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the choking cloud&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of dust&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chosen soldier rises&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bringing his deadliest gifts &nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He is reborn in the dying light&nbsp;</p>
<p>He instigates thy doom&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ravens wings turn the sky to black&nbsp;</p>
<p>As he makes this world thy tomb &nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Underneath his slain brethren&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vanquished soldier&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marches, save us from the abyss &nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>His soul is devoured in wrath&nbsp;</p>
<p>His dreams are empowered and yet twisted&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the great crypts &nbsp;</p>
<p>He is reborn in the dying light&nbsp;</p>
<p>He instigates thy doom&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ravens wings turns the sky to black&nbsp;</p>
<p>As he makes this world thy tomb &nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lifeless husk, revived from new&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plant your rage defeat the fallen&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save your heart and soul &nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He is reborn in the dying light&nbsp;</p>
<p>He instigates thy doom</p>
<p>&nbsp;Ravens wings turn the sky to black&nbsp;</p>
<p>As he makes this world thy tomb &nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With a sacrifice of my soul,&nbsp;</p>
<p>before A blazing funeral pile for you</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So, there are two pretty&nbsp;</p>
