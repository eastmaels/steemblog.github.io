This may not be the sexiest post ever, but I was doing a test.  Today I got the second of my 3 answers to my test.  The test was regarding paywithsteem.

## Test 1 <h2>

Earbuds.  They are allegedly on order and shipping from China.  They'll be here in like 2 weeks.

## Test 2 <h2>

Amazon gift card.  It was instant for the egift card.  I was the dutiful crypto enthusiast husband and simply gave the access to muh wife.  She's bought some ~~shit~~ household items with it already.  

## Test 3 <h2>

Puffs Plus.  I wanted to test their Amazon Wishlist service.  It came today.  It was slightly more expensive than just doing it straight through amazon, but now I have a very convenient way to turn crypto into household items.  If I'm being fully honest I was preparing an unboxxing video for this, but my 5 year old opened the box before I even got home. (*&^(*&%&%^$&^%*&^(*&^


## My main point is you should own steem as we keep getting more and more useful tools and websites <h2>

I'm just pretty stoked for this platform.  I needed a way to spend crypto to get physical home goods to settle some waggro.  Within days of me wishing it was here it was already up and running.  We have an incredibly passionate group of talented people who spend hours making programs and colorful content for the Steem ecosystem.  Specifically on on top of that now is a gateway to Amazon direct from Steem.  This is a great thing for the platform and I'm encouraging you to use it.
