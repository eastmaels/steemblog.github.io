I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be writing this post.  Steempeak just integreated Steem Keychain and it's as easy as can be to login, switch accounts, and get posts drafted.  This is huge news because as we integrate more sites into the network using Keychain, and as we integrate more tools directly into Keychain the community will have many tools directly at their fingertips!

I'm so proud to have been involved in getting Steem Keychain up and running.  it's just at the starting point.  Firefox and tokens are coming soon...  it's gonna be YUGE!
