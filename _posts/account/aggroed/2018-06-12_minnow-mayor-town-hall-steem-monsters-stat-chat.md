Get your head out of the crypto blood bath and join us for the future digital blood bath of simulated monster combat.  This show is technically the Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  For the first hour I spend time talking to @offoodandart for her food contest that she shares with a few friends.  We discuss crypto current prices for a few minutes, then talk contest, and then talk about the writing components of what we're doing over with Steem Monsters.

The next 90 min is really all about stats in the game that we're planning on using for the cards.  


## Stats 

Monsters will have 

Physical attack- Physical Damage done
Magic attack- Damage done to health
Armor- Physical damage absorbed before damage to health
Health- hit points before dead
Speed- determines who goes first and liklihood of landing a hit
Special Abilities- A long list of abilities that monsters can have to give them special powers.

## Card value

Generally speaking a Mana cost 5 common = mana cost 4 rare = mana cost 3 epic = mana cost 2 legendary in terms of overall strength

Generally speaking a common a level 2 common would be a like a level 1 rare.  A level 3 common would be like a 1 epic.  A level 4 common would be a like a level 1 legendary.  

## Steps

Essentially there are three dials you have for card power.  

Mana cost
Rarity
Level

Tweaking the mana cost up by 1 = common level up by 1 = rarity up by 1.

It's trickier to think of the other rarities because they don't have 10 levels, but if you need a guage of how good a card is relative to another this is a pretty good metric.


## Enjoy the show
