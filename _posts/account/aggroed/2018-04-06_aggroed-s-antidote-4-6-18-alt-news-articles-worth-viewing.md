Reviving Aggroed's Antidote for a little bit while so much news is pouring out of the woodwork.  Basically if it doesn't fit on a meme, but seems like important news I'll try to segregate onto here.  I happen to believe that if more people had a better news feed they might be more skeptical of what governments are doing to their people and possibly wake up faster or see through lies quicker.  Here's hoping.
