I often wonder if Trump is a force for good or bad in the world.  On the one hand he's a crass man that seems intollerant to other people.  He at times seems pretty racist and clearly doesn't treat ladies that well.  We just passed an ombibus budget that seems to grow the national debt and fuel projects at the tune of 1.3T.  That's expensive...

But while digging for memes for Meme the News I came across a meme regarding one of the leaked HRC emails.  This one is to Donna Brazile who at the time was the chair of the DNC.

## Clinton Body count <h2>

If you're not paying attention you may have missed the myraid of crimes that seems to follow the Clinton's around.  There are multiple websites dedicated to how much violence they have caused.  Some of it is documented like killing hundreds of thousands of people in wars over seas, and other parts of it are more hidden like alledged murders, drug running, and human trafficking (especially out of Haiti).

## The quote

The fact that HRC herself has some pretty strong language regarding him makes me feel better.  One idea is that there's not difference between Hillary and Trump.  That they support the same stuff and are part of the same billionaire's club.  I've read allegations in a lawsuit that Trump was involved in sexual abuse/rape at the Epstein Ranch.  It makes me pause and doubt whether I think he's a force for good in the world.  He also has some business practices that seem to have crossed the line into unethical.  

That said we also have stories about human trafficking being stopped around the world.  To me pedophilia and human trafficking are center pieces of the deep state heinous crimes.  that and the opiod epidemic.  It's been exposed for a while that the CIA was using military bases to fly drugs around the world.  I don't think that all military people are bad... but I think there are a lot of bad people in the military.  I mean they kill a lot of people every year.

## Clinton is a particularly bad egg

I used to be a Democrat.  I still have some Democratic values thinking everyone should be housed, fed, clothed, educated, and medicated as necessary.  That said I dont' share the idea that we should be nation building elsewhere, violent with our troops, or stealing/extorting money through taxes to pay for things you don't fundamentally believe in or want.  

Watching how badly Clinton would talk out of one side of her mouth while simultaneously acting in a completely opposing manor.  Reading about Uranium One.  And learning about the Clinton Body Count, the body double, the sickness, and just watching her intently under the microscope really helped me learn what a bad leader and person she strikes me as.

Combine this with recent revelations by Abel Danger aka Field McConnell that Hillary is operating much of the Pedo network along with Field's sister in the Senior Executive Service just further clarifies that she's an enemy to the people.

In her own words Trump is a "fuckin bastard.  We're all going to hang from nooses [if he wins]"

Nothing has given me more confidence he's a force for good than hearing from her just how dangerous she thinks he is.

Now I just gotta hope the trial is faster than the complete deterioration of her health (Huma, her aide (lover?),  called her a walking corpse).
