<p>Steem is crashing. &nbsp;Whatever support people thought there was at $0.20 was minuscule compared to overwhelming amount of Steem looking to be sold (millions of liquid steem, and hundreds of million SP locked steem). &nbsp;At the moment I think the only people putting money into steem are well wishers who want to see the platform do well. &nbsp;They are the active users. &nbsp;This place is going to get mighty lonely mighty quickly because people are going to bail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>First your reward gets cut down to 3/4 cause curation goes away, and then it gets divided by <del>five</del> 7 because steem is only worth <del>$0.20</del> $0.14. &nbsp;So now your well written article that didn't have any whales vote on it goes down to less than $0.01 USD. &nbsp;That picture only gets more grim when steem drops lower, and that's the main reason why people will leave.</p>
<p>How many rants did you read at $5 steem when people actually left? &nbsp;Probably not many because even those rants were probably worth $10USD. &nbsp;Now, you can't make any money. &nbsp;Now you leave the community. &nbsp;That's a double whammy because the people most likely to buy steem are the ones that like this place and use it and want to support it. &nbsp;So, not only did you lose an author but you lost a potential investor, and that means that there is an even bigger amount of pressure on the sell column versus the diminishing buy column.</p>
<p>This is a fast race to the bottom people. &nbsp;You'll see how many people really believe in steem by the new year because their posts are going to be worth absolutely nothing financially.</p>

<p>So, short picture: steem is crashing (at an accelerated rate), people are leaving, that makes steem crash faster, and that makes people leave faster. &nbsp;This is a vicious downward spiral.</p>
<p>Oh, and what do Ned and Dan have to say about this?</p>
