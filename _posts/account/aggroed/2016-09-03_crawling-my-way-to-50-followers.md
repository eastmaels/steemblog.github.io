<p>I suppose I'm over thinking I'm going to get rich off of STEEMIT. &nbsp;It's still fun to post here. &nbsp;One thing that does make me sad though is how hard it is to gain followers. &nbsp;I've been on for 4 weeks now. &nbsp;I have just shy of 50 followers.</p>
<p>Granted. &nbsp;I'm talking about weird shit. &nbsp;I dig the Mandela Effect. &nbsp;I dig conspiracy. &nbsp;I talk about the occult. &nbsp;I love Harambe. &nbsp;Maybe that's not the secret to getting fans on here.</p>
<p>What does get fans is having a fan base somewhere else or being famous for something. &nbsp;Adam Kokesh comes on and gets a great big following overnight. &nbsp;Silk Road's mom gets a huge following overnight. &nbsp;I mean I get it. &nbsp;Those are overnight successes that took 5 years and a bunch of drugs and prison sentences to earn, but I'm still here making a face like this.<img src="http://www.unk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/jealousy.jpg" width="900" height="673"/></p>
<p>Anyway, as I keep up what I internally call my "online diary of a conspiracy theorist that basically no one reads" I'll just have to live with my imperfections and current state of envy.</p>
