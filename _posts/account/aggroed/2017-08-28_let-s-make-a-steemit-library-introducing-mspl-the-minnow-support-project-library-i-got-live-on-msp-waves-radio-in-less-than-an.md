OK, first off, @swelker101 is on the radio right now with his lovely lady friend @isaria!  You should tune in for the second half of his show and check out his cleverness.  http://mspwaves.com/home/listen/

Second off I'm going live after @swelker101.  Gonna play a mix of music and talk about Steemit and the direction of the Minnow Support Project.  We're recruiting channel mods, general mods, and working on a variety of projects!

## Speaking of Projects- MSPL <h2>

That's right.  So, I saw this great post by @justinw and it really got me thinking.  

https://steemit.com/steemdev/@justinw/how-easy-it-is-to-develop-steem-blockchain-apps-with-video-tutorial

What if we could build a library to help everyone on Steemit learn to code?  Or learn English?  Or learn whatever?  Generally speaking here's how it could work.  You make a post on Steemit.  Possibly include a video from dtube, youtube, or vimeo.  Then you send it our way.  And we put it in the archives.  You get paid, you get views, you build your rep, and then we host it in a place where it's likely to catch post rewards and followers even after you're done!!!

How can we do this?

## Steemshelves.com <h2>

A little while back I wanted a place to put all of my serialized posts.  I've been telling folks since day one you have to serialize posts so that people that like the content will come back.  Just stick with a few things you're intersted in and other folks that like those same things will follow.  That said, I also have a ton of interests on here.  So if you're reading through my blog trying to find Meme the News it's a pain in the ass.  So, I turned to @rhondak and had a conversation with her and before I blinked she had created a website called steemshelves.  Ok, so now you can send her a link and we can archive it in a central location!!!

So, how this work for the library?  Well, you still have to send her a note with a link to the article, but now we can start putting these things into sections in the library.  We're going to start with Steemit programming.  So, that folks that are making tutorial videos on how to make apps and programs for Steemit we can house all of those in one place.  I'm spoken to a few people and here's a partial list of stand outs below.

@heimindanger
@justinw
@ausbitbank
@blueorgy
@sircork
@martibis
@inertia
@netuoso
@r0nd0n

## What to do?  <h2>

Tag your post with #mspl and after you author it send the url in a transfer note to @rhondak.  Please include which language you're using and a general sense of the challenge level: start-here, novice, intermediate, or advanced level.

We're going to start with programming and then find another active and/or active community and start storing things in the library, but programming seems the most immement need for Steemit, so let's start there?

## What are the benefits? <h2>

Well, the community will have a library of posts stored in a central archive folks can put into.  If you're authoring you'll get your  own post, your own reward, and then we'll archive.  So, we're not taking anything from you.  We're just adding a service.  To start this @minnowsupport will cover the cost of labor for @rhondak to shelve things.  So, literally it will only cost you the 0.001sbd to add your work to the central library found at steemshelves.com and I made the account @mspl which may eventually get used.

## It's just another witness project brought to you by @aggroed and the Minnow Support Project Community!!! <h2>

If you like what we're doing please vote for my witness and that of the other folks running campaigns out of MSP-

## Vision <h2>

MSP is a big town or small city, and we're growing.  We're going to grow faster because @timcliff got us on the welcome page with his latest pull request.  Cities need to offer services.  We started with bot to allow us community accounts.  We added a webpage.  We created a radio station with mspwaves.com.  Now we're adding a library.  We'll get a school eventually.  All your government services that you could ever want, free to use, and completely open to the public.  That's where we're headed!  Come join us.  If you don't have the time to work with us, but want to support what we're doing please delegate some Steem Power to our various projects!
