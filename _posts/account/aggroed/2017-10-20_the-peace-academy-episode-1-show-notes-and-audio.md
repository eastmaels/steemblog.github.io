## <center> *Peace, Abundance, and Liberty* </center>

Peace, Abundance, and Liberty are not simply nouns or static ideas.
They are constantly in motion.
They are our ultimate goals, but the path is not always easy or clear.  We continually make adjustments due to our experiences and challenges in order to figure out what the best solution is for all three.
Just like when sailing a ship, the wind may shift the boat’s direction, but it doesn’t change our destination.


The question to consider is how can we achieve these goals within our own lives, in our communities, and ultimately within the world?

* How can we bring about Peace?
* How can we actualize Abundance so there is plenty to go around for everyone?
* How can we negotiate Liberty - to say or be who we are while not hurting our neighbors?


Peace, Abundance, and Liberty in this sense are verbs and actions.  
They require a mindfulness to consistently be able to actualize them.
There aren’t always clear answers, decisions often fall into the grey zone.
So we try to find guideposts and choose a path where we can live with ourselves and live with our neighbors.

## <center> *Curriculum* </center>

Because we can’t just work on these ideas once a week during a radio show, we have decided to start a Curriculum for Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.

The first step to achieving peace with others is first attaining a sense of inner peace within ourselves.
If we can’t sit with ourselves and feel some sort of inner peace then how can we have peace with others?

Self-care is key. 
Think of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. 
We start first by taking care of basic physiological needs then move up the chain, ultimately working on our Mind, Body, and Spirit.

## <center> *Energy* </center>

Part of this work includes the realization that we are all connected through Universal energy.

Technology has shown the energy that our thoughts create through experiments where devices can measure brain waves and we can interact with other devices by only using our brain waves.
Our thoughts are energy and this energy interacts with other people.
How you think and feel will impact the reality around you.
So, be aware of your thoughts throughout the day.
Unnesecessary negative thoughts lead to negative emotions.  
This energy is sent out and then reflected back.

*We attract who we **are**, not what we want.*

There is so much more to this world than what we have been taught and concepts like these are often misunderstood or disregarded, but they are the basis of our existence.
Think about radio waves.  They are here, everywhere, all around us.  Just because we can’t see them doesn’t mean they don’t exist.  
We just aren’t tuned into a frequency to receive them unless we use a receiver.
We are energy and we can tune into one another.  
We can either resonate constructively or destructively.

We are not isolated, detached beings.
We are interconnected beings that share in this thought matrix of the universe.

And all of us together can make this world a better place with Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.
