## Removing Consent

  
When you fight something you are actually acknowledging that it has power over you.
In a sense, this is a form of consent.

Completely removing consent involves dropping all energetic signatures that you might be feeding into it in order to not give it any power.

This is why it is said that the opposite of love is not hate, it is apathy.

## Removing Consent from the Biggest Lie Ever Told
  

We are taught to believe that people from certain countries are an existential threat to our nation, and if we don’t kill them where they live they are going to harm us.
People believe this bullshit rhetoric and enlist to fight to protect our nation based on these lies, putting themselves and others in danger.

There is no need to fly a drone over some Third World country, dropping bombs and killing innocent people.
But this has become acceptable to us because we have been fed these lies since childhood.

This is not by accident. It has been purposely designed in order to control the masses by way of fear.
When there is an external threat, it is a lot easier to control people.
This has been happening since Ancient Roman times and still continues today.

## The Greatest PR Campaign in History  

The United States has unleashed the greatest PR campaign in history by deluding it’s own citizens into believing that it is the greatest country.
Our citizens have been brainwashed since childhood to believe that we are the only country that can provide freedom to everyone…..but it must be through force.

**Forced freedom…is not freedom!**

Those in power **must** create wars in order to  justify the gross amount of military spending. 
We have billions of dollars for unnecessary weaponry, yet we don’t have the money to take care of our own soldiers….or the millions of Americans currently living in poverty.
