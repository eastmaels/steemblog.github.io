Nothing like a little MS Paint to help you explain how you're feeling post Hard Fork!  So, we don't have a rewards curve anymore.  We have a rewards coaster.  It's pretty thrilling at the start, but it leaves me crying on the inside a few days later.

## Point A: Creating your post <h2>

I checked my spelling.  Looks good.  Whales are online.  It's not too late.  Not too early.  Made a funny title.  Check.  Newb friendly?  Check.  I want this to reach 3k... so I should probably talk about EOS, but I'm not ready to go there yet.  I'm still kinda working on Steemit.  I'll just talk about whale balls and Hard Forks.  Shit looks good to go for a few hundred dank amps.  Fire the big blue button.  POST!

## Point B: happy slappy whale balls <h2>

BOOM!  Giant Balls straight up ahead!!!  We've taken a full hit.  Dank amps register a $100 upvote.  WOOT.  Call yo wife!  Call yo' kidz!  Erryone is gettin' paid up in this bish!  Trending here we go!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Point C: Holy shit another whale!!! <h2>

We've hit the thirty minute mark.  We have not 1 but 2 whales on board.  Holy fuck.  We're rich son.  Gonna quit my job.  Slap my boss.  Poop in the copy the machine.  Who the fuck cares.  You see them whale ballz hit!  I never have to work again!!!!

## Point D: wait... shit... ugh, I guess they didn't mean 100% <h2>

Ok, so whale 2 readjusted their ballz.  It's ok.  We're ok.  Sorry about that sir.  I can clean up the mess I made.  I'll go talk to HR about physical conduct.  Sorry.  It won't happen again.  

## Point E:  Hey did my post go down a little?  <h2>

I mean, I'm not sure, but an hour ago when I was obsessively staring at my post and reading and then rereading my own post and the replies I made to the comments on my post I could have sworn that I was a little bigger than this... I mean.  I checked on esteem and it doesn't look like anyone adjusted their vote... Fuck, I'm getting old.  I think I'm losing it a little.

## Point F:  Nope, confirmed, where's my money Nedowski?  Give me back my post rewards or I'll cut off your johnson <h2>

Yeah, you heard me.  We're nihlists.  We believe in nothing.  Give us the fucking money.  I saw my post rewards.  I had two whales spray fat amps on my post.  Now you're taking it away?  That's bullshit.  You had one job.  One job.  Send me the post rewards that I had two days ago.  It's down like 15% what the fuck gives?

## Point G:  Why god why?  Why did you take my post rewards?  Why Lord?  I'll be good!  Pleazzzzzzzzzzzzz <h2>

How can this be.  My posts.  My fucking posts.  I had so much in them.  It's 20 minutes before they give me rewards and they're down 30%.  Why god why?  I was gonna elope that 24 year old secretary.  I was gonna start a family.  I was promised a free lambo.  Now... Nothing.  It's all gone.  Why u do dis?

## At least it appears to be regressive <h2>

What's that mean?  It looks to be cutting about 30% off of all my posts.  If you're making a dollar it'll cut off $0.30.  That kinda sucks, but it was just $0.30.  If you're at $1500 it brings it down to like $1,000.  Same percent, but now it's $500.  Maybe that's good for minnows?  Tough to get a read on since I'm only now really starting to see it.  I wonder if this is adjustment or the new normal.  Ironically my posts are making more, but by the end it feels like less since it went down 33%.

What do you guys think?
