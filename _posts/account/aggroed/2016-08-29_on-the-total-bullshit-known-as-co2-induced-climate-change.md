<p>&nbsp;Sometime around 2012 I stopped believing in CO2 enacted climate change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I've taken a lot of shit for this. &nbsp;However, it seems that the ice caps on the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2738653/Stunning-satellite-images-summer-ice-cap-thicker-covers-1-7million-square-kilometres-MORE-2-years-ago-despite-Al-Gore-s-prediction-ICE-FREE-now.html">oceans are growing back</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2738653/Stunning-satellite-images-summer-ice-cap-thicker-covers-1-7million-square-kilometres-MORE-2-years-ago-despite-Al-Gore-s-prediction-ICE-FREE-now.html">image source</a>.</p>
<p>First hand accounts of coral by <a href="https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/06/03/expert-scientists-exaggerated-coral-bleaching-story/">deep sea divers and scientists</a> say 85% of the Great Barrier Reef isn't bleached, and much of it will recover. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.space.news/2015-10-06-entire-solar-system-is-heating-up-scientists-blame-solar-warming.html">Planets around the solar system are heating up</a> (not just Earth). &nbsp;Now, we find out from DCLEAKS that none other than insurrection funder George Soros <a href="http://wearechange.org/george-soros-paid-al-gore-millions-lie-global-warming/">paid Al Gore and his organization $10M/yr </a>to sell the climate change story to the public. &nbsp;This whole thing is a bullshit scheme to scam taxpayers of even more money to keep the whole petrosystem going.</p>

<p>That <a href="https://ftmdaily.com/preparing-for-the-collapse-of-the-petrodollar-system/">petrodollar</a> system extends beyond just the oil itself. &nbsp;The oil itself is a lot of billions, but it's nothing compared to keeping the USD propped up as the reserve currency. &nbsp;If you want energy in your economy you have to buy oil, and the agreements make it so you have to buy it in USD. &nbsp;That's why America's currency isn't worthless despite the fact that we've been printing new dollars since 1930s when the central bank was created and ramped it up to 11 after the 2008 financial crisis. &nbsp;Our dollar is the only way to legally buy oil. &nbsp;So, Russia et al. have to trade their currency for USD to purchase oil. &nbsp;It means the paper we print is now worth foreign goods. &nbsp;The other thing that backs this is the US Army (and their proxy wars and mercenaries) who literally kill anyone that tries to stop this system from working or providing an alternative (Iran, Syria, Iraq, Libya have tried circumventing the petrodollar and you know what happened to all of them). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, it's not even really a conspiracy theory anymore that US invaded some if not all of those nations to <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/declassified-emails-reveal-natos-true-motive-topple-gaddafi-stop-creation-gold-backed-african-currency/">protect the petro dollar</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;(just saying I didn't need to put that last sentence into parentheses)</p>

<p>Now, in case you forgot about <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2011/11/23/climategate-2-0-new-e-mails-rock-the-global-warming-debate/#48ee9256988d">Climategate</a>, a quick reminder: a leaked email trove from the Nobel Prize winning International Panel on Climate Change So that suggested basically everything they put out was a lie, manipulated, and highly political instead of scientific.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What they are doing is selling you a totally bullshit climate story to raise a global tax to give them more money to sell more bullshit to you and continue to prop the oligarchs and globalists in control. &nbsp;The same media that told you that global warming is real and a carbon tax is necessary told you that: <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/05/20/george_w_bushs_cia_briefer_admits_iraq_wmd_intelligence_was_a_lie/">Iraq had weapons of mass destruction</a>, <a href="https://28pages.org/">saudi arabia had nothing to do with 9/11</a>, and the <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/secret-and-lies-of-the-bailout-20130104">bank bailout</a> was necessary to make sure the economy didn't collapse. &nbsp;[and that's without even getting into the really touchy subjects]</p>
<p>Anyway, just wanted to say "I told you so."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Do you still believe in the climate hoax? &nbsp;What convinces you?</p>
