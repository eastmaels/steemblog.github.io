Looking around the room both Bill and Hillary Clinton are exceptionally pleased with how large of a crowd they drew.  This reporter was able to briefly catch up with them.

Aggroed: Hillary, how are you feeling today?

Hillary: Great!  You know, Bill and I just couldn't be happier to have such a large crowd gathered today.  It really helps us know our place in history.

Aggroed: What a momentous occasion.  What's going through your head right now.

Hillary: Well, in just a few minutes I think those soldiers will have some thoughts on that.  *laughter that then turns into coughing fit.*  But in the meantime we just couldn't be more excited to be with the American people on this historic day.

Aggroed: What do you think brought you here?

Hillary: Well, Aggroed, you know, it's a combination of things.  Of course Russian Collusion in the last election seems to have misplaced the American votes.  Without the Russians I think everyone knows that I would have been President.  But that's just not how it played out.  I supposed being scandal ridden for 30 years, and I'm not just talking about Bill here, but a whole life time of public service I think was a major contributor.  

That said, the real culprit is the military tribunal we sat through.  Not only was it dreadfully dull, but they decided that we were guilty of a body count in the dozens, were guilty of child trafficking especially in Haiti, don't even mention Benghazi, Uranium One, my email server where I sold classified military secrets, or a million other things.  What that court did to us was inexcusable....

Bill: But we're not gonna let that get us down!  We're so happy the media and so many great Americans from the proud State of Texas could be here with us to celebrate this book signing.

The lights flickered a little and it was clear it was time for the show.  Bill and Hillary ushered me off.  They looked so happy to have a full stadium!

I've heard it said a few times that the promise of uncensored stories isn't really lived up to on the Steem ecosystem.  That the liberty platform isn't important.  I'd just like to note that if I wrote this piece of satire on other platforms I would get banned.  I say this having been banned on Facebook at least 5 times.  I wouldn't completely dismiss the power of an immutable blockchain to record political commentary.

Sorry if you were offended.  I was offended when I discovered their crime spree too!

No politicians were harmed or threatened during the making of this political theater.  It's all just a joke.  Calm your gender neutral chest lumps.
