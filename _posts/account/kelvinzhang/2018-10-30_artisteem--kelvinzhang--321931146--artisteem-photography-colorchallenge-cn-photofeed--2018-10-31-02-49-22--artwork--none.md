When the light of sunset fell on the yellow larch it presented a dazzling orange-red color. It looks like the trees are on fire.
This photo was taken by me when we were hiking in Xinjiang Kanas National Geopark of China. Actually, we had finished the photography for a lake behind this place.We were preparing to set up camp fot the night. Suddenly we found this scene and took the photo immediately.
Camera: Canon 5D II. Setting: ISO800, 1/160s, f/5, 70mm
