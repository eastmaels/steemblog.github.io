![ntopaz-image-0](https://artisteem.io/media/7940f883-6108-41ce-89ac-62b58412890c)Hemu village is located in the northwest of China. There is very cold in winer. When I took this photo the weather was cloudy.  The birch trees had shed their leaves. And the spruce leaves had been almost black. The whole village was covered with thick snow. The birch forest ups and downs over the mountains, alternating with the village. Just like an ink lanscape painting. Even I took this photo in color mode, the color were almost black and white.

禾木村坐落于中国的西北部，冬天的时候非常的冷。当我拍这张照片的时候刚好是阴天，白桦林的叶子已经掉光，云杉也差不多都程黑色，整个村长被厚厚的白雪覆盖着。层层叠叠的白桦林高低起伏于山峦之间，与村庄错落交替，俨然一幅山水墨画。即使当时我拍彩色照片，其实照片也差不多就是黑白色的。
