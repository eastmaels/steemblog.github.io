<p>Four Girls town is located in Sichuan province, China. There is a famous scenery spot - Four Girls Mountains. The four Girls Mountains are as beautiful as their name. The below picture was taken on the road from Four Girls Town to Danba and not far away from Four Girls town. This place is over 3,000 meters above sea level. So here is between at the end of autumn and at the beginning of winter. There was a heavy snow the night before. The yellow leaves on the trees haven't fallen completely yet. It looks like a painting when the high mountains were covered with a layer of snow.</p>

Our trip was special designed for the autumn scenery of Danba. The altitude in Danba is lower than Four Girls town. Now is the best time for fall colors here. There was some Tibetan village in Danba county. There are beautiful buildings with local ethnic characteristics. Jiaju, Middle Road, Soupo are the most famous villages. The below picture was taken in Zhonglu village. Because the village is located in a valley surrounding high mountain. The sun would completely set after half past five. We found a place for the backlighting on a hillside of east to get outstanding fall colors.  The tall buildings are the watchtowers of local Tibetan in ancient times. The oldest existing watchtower is more than 2,000 years old. And the last watchtower is more than 200 years old. The watchtowers was made of stones. They were stand there even encountered the famous big earthquake.  And the shorter buildings are the house of local Tibetan people.
