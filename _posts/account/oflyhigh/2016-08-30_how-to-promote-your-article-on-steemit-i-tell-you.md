Today, I found that a new section "Promoted" was added near the trending, what's "Promoted", how does it work?
Maybe everyone want to know it.

今天，发现了 trending旁边多了个"Promoted"，什么鬼？怎么用？

And I found an article made by @steemitblog ，a good introduction of it， but some out of date.
Because an easier way to promote your article is online now,  we don't need to transfer Steem Dollars to @null manually.

我发现了 @steemitblog 的一篇文章，介绍了"Promoted"，但是里边操作啥的还是手工转钱给 @null 账户，有些过时啦，因为更容易的方式已经上线啦。

And how to use it, Let's begin.

那么到底咋用，来，开课了

* Submit or select an article you want to promote, at the end of article, you will find a `PROMOTE` button.

* Click this button, you will open a `Promote  post` dialog page.

* When you finished promote processing, the fund will be added to `Boost payments`

And now, you can find your article in promote section.
This section sorts articles based on `Boost payments`.

现在，你可以在promote 标签下找到你的文章啦
这里边的文章按 `Boost payments` 总金额排序。

Now, Enjoy it.
