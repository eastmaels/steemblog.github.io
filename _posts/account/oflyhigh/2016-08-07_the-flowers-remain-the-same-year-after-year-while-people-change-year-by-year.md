年年岁岁花相似，岁岁年年人不同。
The flowers remain the same year after year while people change year by year.

以下一组照片摄于沈阳世博园。
This group of photos was taken at the Expo Park in Shenyang.

风光秀丽，花香醉人。
Beautiful scenery, beautiful flowers are intoxicating.

就像歌词中唱的，
Just like the words in the song
>Looking back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed
