##  Items under BALANCES 
As we know, there are three items under BALANCES 
1. `STEEM`
2. `STEEM POWER`
3. `STEEM DOLLARS`

And all of them are used to calculate `Estimated Account Value`

## Long time taken to  convert
It will take place one week later if we convert `STEEM DOLLARS` to `STEEM`.
The `STEEM DOLLARS` become unavailable once you confirm it.

## Annoying process, Where is my money?
But What is puzzling is that the amount of `STEEM DOLLARS` we try to convert is disappeared from our wallet!
We **CAN NOT** find it in any items under balances.
There **IS NOT** any information in history also.
And if the `Estimated Account Value` is $100,  it should be $40 after the conversion!

After 7 days of waitingï¼Œ the `STEEM DOLLARS` are converted to `STEEM`,  everything is back on track.
But this process is not good.

## My suggestion
So I suggest that add a new item  `STEEM DOLLARS(Locked)` under the  balances field.
And calculate this item in `Estimated Account Value`.
This will bring a better user experience!

## Please upvote me
Hope the management team can see and accept my advice.
If you agree with me, please upvote, thank you.
