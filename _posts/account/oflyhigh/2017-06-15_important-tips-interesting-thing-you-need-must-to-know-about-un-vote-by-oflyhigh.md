Cut a long story short: 
##### ***un-vote will not recover the power***

# upvote consume voting power

You may already know: 
**upvote a post or reply will consume some voting power.**

For example, if you have 100% voting power, and upvote a post with 100% weight,  then you will cost 0.5% voting power of you.

The left voting power can be calculated by the following formula:
`vp = vp - vp*weight*5%`
(I am not sure, but it should be)

# un-vote doesn't restore your power

But some of you may don't know that:
**un-vote doesn't restore your power**

Let's illustrate the following example:

1) You up-vote a post
Your voting power should be reduced

2) Then you un-vote it,
Your voting power will not recover

3) You up-vote the same post again
Your voting power should be reduced again.

I test the example with my account,  the voting power at each step:
* 52.85 (before upvote)
* 52.58 (upvote with 100% weight)
* 52.58 (un-vote)
* 52.32 (upvote with 100% weight again)

Wow, Wasted twice voting power.

# Conclusion

* ***un-vote*** or ***un-vote then upvote using different weight***  will not save your voting power, but it wastes two times.

* ***un-vote carefully unless you really want to cancel the vote.***

Hope this article will help you to make more curation rewards.
