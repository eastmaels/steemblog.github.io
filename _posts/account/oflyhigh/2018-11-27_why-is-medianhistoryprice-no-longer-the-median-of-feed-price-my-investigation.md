According to my previous understanding,  witnesses feed prices for steem blockchain, as shown in the figure below.

![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYCUwxt2NH6XQRL58aFkSTXvFQ42KWE9ahPrwWTnMfd59/image.png)
(From: https://www.eztk.net/witnesses.php)

And about per hour(***`STEEM_FEED_INTERVAL_BLOCKS`***), STEEM read the feeds from the 21 witnesses(***`current_shuffled_witnesses`***) in current round, and sort the feeds value, get the median value of it.

Then STEEM ***`push_back`*** the median feed value got in above step to the globe feed history object(get_feed_history/price_history), and then remove the oldest feed by pop_front(). The price_history looks like the picture below.

![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUVcRNePEH1u1xxHmnhRVQjysFrrgM1kiq4kXhV5Tdx3w/image.png)

The  price_history length keeps 84, is defined as follows:
>***`#define STEEM_FEED_HISTORY_WINDOW             (12*7) // 3.5 days`***

Then sort the price_history and return the median value as the ***`current_median_history`***.

But now I found two questions, 
* The price of STEEM has been under $0.35 for a long time,  Why is  the  ***`current_median_history`*** still higher than $0.4?

* In the past, we always get the feed price in the form of ***`{'base': '0.308 SBD', 'quote': '1.000 STEEM'}`***, Why now become such a form of ***` {'base': '117738879.462 SBD',  'quote': '285479893.989 STEEM'}`***? This problem also leads to the ***`Estimated Account Value`*** of the wallet shows abnormal.


To find the answers to these two questions, I went to learn the code STEEM, then the following code was found:
https://github.com/steemit/steem/blob/master/libraries/chain/database.cpp#L3258
>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmeXHPjd931ujx4akfnMcVGBpxwy41C4DC4hUbCbwg9jQj/image.png)

The intent of the code has been written in the comments, so I will not repeat them. This code perfectly explains two of my questions.

In the current market conditions(***`min_price > fho.current_median_history`***),median_history_price is no longer calculated by witnesses feeds and history feeds(price_history), it's determined by the supply of STEEM and SBD.

Why hasn't this happened before? I guess it's because we modified ***`STEEM_SBD_START_PERCENT`***  and ***`STEEM_SBD_STOP_PERCENT`***  in HF20. Before HF20 there are 2% & 5%, in HF20 they are 9% & 10%.

# New question

But the new question comes:
The ***`sbd_print_rate`*** is calculated from the supply of STEEM & SBD and the ***`median_history_price`*** and will be zero when ***`STEEM_SBD_STOP_PERCEN(10%)`*** reached. 

But the  ***`median_history_price`*** always be checked to force SBD to remain at or below 10% of the combined market cap of STEEM and SBD.

It seems that we will never get a SBD percentage greater than 10%, So ***`sbd_print_rate`*** will never be zero? If my calculation is correct, it's really an interesting thingðŸ˜€.
