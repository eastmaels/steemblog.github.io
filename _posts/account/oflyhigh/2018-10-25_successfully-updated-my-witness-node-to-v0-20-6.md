About 19 hours ago, steem released the new [v0.20.6](https://github.com/steemit/steem/releases/tag/v0.20.6) version. More details can refer to @steemitblog post [Steem 20.6 Officially Released: RC System Update and Optimization](https://steemit.com/steem/@steemitblog/steem-20-6-officially-released-rc-system-update-and-optimization)

About ten hours ago, when I saw this message, I recompiled the new version of steemd(v0.20.6), and started re-indexing on my backup server.

Now, the replay has been completed and everything is working well, and I have switched my witness to this server.

I am very happy to see that many  issues have been fixed  in this version, I believe that steem will become better and better.

In addition, I have provided a simple tool for you to find witness information.
https://www.eztk.net/tools/my_witnesses.php

You can find detailed information about it here: [Just another witnesses list with some other functions](https://steemit.com/witness-category/@oflyhigh/just-another-witnesses-list-with-some-other-functions)

# 中文版

见证人节点在备份机上完成同步啦，我已经将我的见证人切换到这台服务器上。
顺便宣传一下我的小工具：https://www.eztk.net/tools/my_witnesses.php
