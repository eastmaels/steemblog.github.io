From investigating and analysisï¼Œ I found that `IF YOU DO NOTHING`

## STEEM POWER be increased at a rate about 0.67%

Table: Daily increase rate of STEEM POWER
Date|Rate
----|----
2016-08-08|(0.66%)
2016-08-07|(0.67%)
2016-08-06|(0.67%)
2016-08-05|(0.67%)
2016-08-04|(0.69%)
2016-08-03|(0.69%)
2016-08-02|(0.69%)
2016-08-01|(0.69%)
2016-07-31|(0.70%)
2016-07-30|(0.68%)
2016-07-29|(0.73%)
2016-07-28|(0.71%)
2016-07-27|(0.88%)
2016-07-26|(0.96%)
2016-07-25|(0.96%)

So, If we have 1000 STEEM POWER, and  keep `DO NOTHING`
* ðŸ’¡NO post
* ðŸ’¡NO upvote
* ðŸ’¡NO power up 
* ðŸ’¡NO Power down
* ðŸ’¡NO other action which may cause STEEM POWER changed

## As we can see, the STEEM POWER doubled every 100 days!! 
It seemed incredible!

In the steem white paper :
>STEEM is constantly increasing in supply by `100% per year` due to non-SMD incentives.
Someone who holds STEEM without converting it to SP is diluted by approximately `0.19%
per day`. 

So Daily increase rate of STEEM POWER should be `0.19%` instead of `0.69%`.
And the STEEM POWER should doubled` every 365 days(one year)` instead of `100 days`.

## So, The question is:  What's wrong?

Maybe the programmer of steem entered the wrong number?ðŸ˜€
