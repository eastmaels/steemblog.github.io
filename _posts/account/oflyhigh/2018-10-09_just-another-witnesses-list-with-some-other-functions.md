We may have known that there are some witnesses list.For example:
* https://steemit.com/~witnesses
* https://steemd.com/witnesses
* https://steemian.info/witnesses by @drakos

These lists are very informative and friendly, but do not provide me with additional functions I need. 

For example, I need a ***`reward estimation function`*** to check how many STEEM I earn every day, and at the same time; I also want to know how long it has been since the last block time(***`last confirmed block age`***), In this way, I can roughly predict my next produce time.

In addition to the vote ranking, I also need an ***`active(real) ranking`*** because some witnesses are offline, or run the wrong hardfork version.
***(witnesses list by @drakos already has the active ranking)***

And It would be better if it has a function to ***`check which witnesses we (or others) have supported`***.

So I wrote a witness list script containing the functions I needed above. The temporary URL of it: https://www.eztk.net/tools/my_witnesses.php.

It is some simple but I will continue to improve it, I hope it will help us select the right witnesses to promote the prosperity and development of steem.

Any suggestions are welcome.
