This is the magnolia flower I took in winter, so beautiful.  Magnolia flowers have white, pink, beige, and purple flowers.  Its petals are spread out in all directions, and the cup-shaped corolla not only has a high appreciation value, but also can be eaten (for snacks, tea drinking, etc.).  The white magnolia flower is extraordinarily pure against the blue sky.  The magnolia flower has a lot of words, and it has the meaning of repaying the good, letting people know about the thankful; and the pure and sincere love is really noble.
