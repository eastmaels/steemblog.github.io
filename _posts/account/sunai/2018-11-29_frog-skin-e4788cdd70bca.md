青蛙皮，你敢吃嗎？

Frog skin, do you dare to eat?

一定嚇到了吧！其實不是真的青蛙的皮。是長在岩石或者樹皮上的一種苔蘚。主要分佈在雲南空氣質量極好的高海拔原始森林裡。因為長得像青蛙皮而得名是一種名貴的野生菌。

Must be scared! Actually it is not really the skin of a frog. It is a moss that grows on rocks or bark. It is mainly distributed in the high-altitude virgin forest with excellent air quality in Yunnan.It's a rare mushroom that became famous because it looks like a frog skin.

他真的長得太像青蛙的皮了，第一次在雲南吃到這個菜也著實嚇了一跳，剛開始沒敢吃，以為是真的青蛙的皮，後來才知道是一種野生菌類。哈哈哈。

He really looked too much like the skin of a frog. The first time I ate this dish in Yunnan, I was really shocked. I didn't dare to eat it at first. I thought it was the skin of a frog. Later I learned that it was a wild mushroom. Hahaha.

青蛙皮味道比較淡，但是口感很特別，吃起來硬還脆。入口剛開始有點兒苦，不過，卻是越嚼越香。如果是第一次吃，可能會有點不適應，但吃過後就會愛上他的。

The frog skin tastes lighter, but the taste is very special and it is hard and crisp to eat. The entrance was a bit bitter at first, but it was the more chewy. If it is the first time to eat, it may be a little uncomfortable, but after eating it will fall in love with him.
