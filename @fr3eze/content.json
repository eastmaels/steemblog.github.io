This will leads to eyestrain, headaches and overall decreases the experience.Many studies show how such background lighting can help to improve visual enjoyment on digital screen. Bias lighting isn’t just a showy trick akin to putting superfluous lights on a street rod but a very useful technique that not only increases viewing comfort but image quality at the same time. Bias lighting especially RGB colors of your monitors or television can be the most awesome way to light up your workspace or living room. It just makes everything looks cool. Lately I’ve got a new Dell UltraSharp 27 Monitor U2717D for my personal desktop. It features 1440p resolution with IPS panel makes it the best monitor I’ve ever owned. As I often working with it in my dimmed bed room at night, that would be great if I can add some bias lighting on it. So it begun.How to make my new monitor even more awesomeInstead of getting one of those fancy RGB LED strip with ridiculously expensive price tag, I decided to DIY with these 2 LED USB strips I got from TaoBao for less than $5 including shipping, what a steal!It has double sided tape for me to paste at the rear side of monitor. Powered by USD connection,  simple controller is attached with each of the strip for mode, brightness/speed, color control. For my case to setup a persistent bias lighting for long hours, brightness and color control is most important feature to make hundreds of combination possible.2 LED strips are now attached  to the back of monitor.Next step will be cable managementAlthough the USB connector and controller are light, but the USB cables however is too long and those extra weight is going to pull the pasted LED strip over long hour of application. We need to improvise with something else for the weight problem. I’d go with the almighty binder clips to solve this problem, as some of you may already know how this little tool can be of great help sometimes in the random situation like this.This is how I run the cables as I have 2 USB ports behind the monitor which is a huge advantage for hiding the cables completely from the front view. Do note not all monitors have USB ports.The binder clip keeps all the cables just above the bottom level of monitor, at the same carries all the weight so LED strip would not be pulled off.Now the fun part, color combination!We have everything set and ready, now I have to choose my favorite combination of color. This can be changed anytime by using the color controller and it is easy. Behind the scene, this might not looks great yet, but wait…Voila, This is the final result! Now you can sell why I used 2 strips instead on just one. Because this setup allows me to play with the so many combination of colors when I got bored of the old setting! Of course single color will do just fine for bias lighting, personally I would like to have more options.Oh damn now I will really prolong my already long working hour in front of this sweet monitor!More color combination This page is synchronized from the post: ‘How to make your display more awesome by bias lighting’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/how-to-make-your-display-more-awesome-by-bias-lighting/"},{"title":"Never knew I gotta introduce myself!","text":"Yo there, glad to greet y’all in this awesome platform!I’m a 27 years old from Malaysia. Computer lover with IT background, as well as a new believer in the amazing blockchain technology.I deeply believe blockchain gonna be the future and improve our live in every aspect. I started to spend a couple of hours every day on studying this technology, exploring new projects, and trying my best to take part in interesting projects. Steemit turns out to be the most easy project for anyone to dive in. Woohoo! 大家好！我是个电脑爱好者，27岁，来自马来西亚，是区块链技术的新拥护者。 我深信区块链技术将会让我们未来变得更美好，所以每天都花几个小时来学习这项技术，探索新的虚拟币计划，和不断尝试参与其中。Steemit 是目前为止最容易让人们全身投入的计划，没有之一！ I love workout.I called this ‘hobby of life’. However as a total big fan of bodyweight workout, I do not belong to the mainstream ‘gym rat’ race, so I can happily workout anywhere anytime with the least environmental restrictions. No time is wasted going to the gym and no money is wasted on gym membership. Lesser cost yet higher intensity. Yay, train like a gymnast! 我爱锻炼，这是个终身爱好。 但我对健身院并不太感冒，徒手訓練才是王道。不需花时间赶去健身院，不需花钱在会员证。随时随地就能训练，免费的同时还能保持高强度！ I love art.I love creating them, admiring them. As much as I used to indulge in this addictive activities, I’ve been away for quite a while. Missing those days having so much fun with the the brushes, may be I should pick them up again in the near future, and of course I shall share it with you Steemians! 我爱艺术，包括创造和赏析它们。 尽管我曾经那么的热爱这项活动，忙起来现在也许久没有动笔了。但那些挥笔如洒得日子也真够令人怀念的，希望不久的将来能够再度回归艺术的怀抱。当然了，一定要来这里分享的啦！ I love travelling.Apparently, who doesn’t love travelling? I enjoy recording every trip as I think video talks better than picture. But well, currently I don’t spend too much time on this yet. May be once or twice in a year for a short getaway for not more than a week. Time and money is the biggest constraints for me to plan for more trips, as I prefer to put the resources more onto higher prioritized stuffs. I swear I will travel all year long when I’m a cryptomillionaire, haha! 我爱旅行，其实有谁不爱呢。 比起拍照，旅途中我更喜欢用视频记录一切，视频让日后的回味更有味道，难道不是吗？其实现今阶段我并没有花太多时间在旅行上，目前还有更多值得我把资源投入的事还没达成。但要是日后我有机会成为虚拟币百万富翁，全年旅行是绝对跑不掉的，呵呵！ And, creating more quality contentsYes I think this is the only effective way to grow our beloved community. I’v promised myself to create at least one content every one or two days, HARD for a lazy person like me, but I should keep on trying! Peace~ 最后，我相信创造有价值的内容是让Steemit日渐壮大的唯一途径。我计划每两天起码写一篇文章，但以我对自己的了解程度而言，有点难度啊。无论如何，让后我们拭目以待吧！加油！ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Never knew I gotta introduce myself!’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/never-knew-i-gotta-introduce-myself/"},{"title":"Will #NSFW be the biggest payout topic?","text":"Steemit as miniature of the InternetEveryone know how big the internet porn is. But you might not have a clear mind how big it actually is. By all these studies we can tell pornography is so linked to human nature. That’s the result of freedom provided by Internet. Wipe out the whole internet search history of mankind and start everything over again, one hour later you will find the same amount of traffic to the porn sites. As much as Steemit granted so much freedom to the user that no other social medias can even come close, same thing is likely to take place here. These are the trending top payout topics. God know will someday tags like ‘#NSFW’ ‘#porn’ ‘#sexy’ be at their pinnacle? Will this kill Steemit?Well, I would keep a wait-and-see attitude how thing is going to play out.Steemit grants us the ability to “Say No to Internet Censorship”. That’s why we love it. People up-voting quality works, flagging the contrast. And flagging is the only way to censor a content by reducing its visibility in the platform, but the content isn’t going anywhere. I’d say this is the right how things should be “censored” by users instead of centralized authorities. Finally, as Steemit is still in the infant stage considering how much we expecting it to be the next Reddit killer, I shouldn’t be over-worried by now.

During trips? Clearing customs? What awaits you will be numerous visits to the customs office, police stations, and embassies. I can definitely imagine the doomed feeling although I have no experience on that yet(touch wood). Passport is the last thing you want to lose in a foreign country, simply because the maddening troubles you have to go through before getting a new piece of paper to prove your identity again. Isn’t this funny in this modern world? We all relying so much on an extremely vulnerable proof of identity during traveling, we must protect it like our most previous whenever we go, endless troubles ahead if failed to do so. Fortunately, there is BlockchainWith this amazing technology, getting rid of paper passport become realistic. Flexible capacityOne of the remarkable features of blockchain is that network capacity can be easily expanded. Migration of traditional passport information to digital form can be done in large scale without pressuring the network much, as there is thousands of hundred computer help scaling the network capability and size. Better securityThere is no single point of failure to shut down the blockchain network. Of course, perfectly secured system is non-existent in the world, but so far nothing offer higher security other than blockchain. There will be no paper passport, thus you will have one item less to keep or to lose. ImmutabilityAll centralized databases are prone to corruption. One has no options but to trust the third party authority to keep safe our identity. While in the world of blockchain, you have to trust no one. Computer hashing power and algorithm makes it almost impossible to change the history of record in the database. Faster settlementIn the case of losing a passport, you need to provide alternative documents as proof of your existence in the world. And those things take forever to be validated. Retrieving information from blockchain is almost instantaneous. As long as you can provide something(may be a private key) that can link to your identity in the network, boom! You are a legal traveler again! Final thoughtI’m so sick of double checking if my passport is still sleeping well in my bag when I was busy climbing a beautiful mountain or visiting a crowded market in foreign places. Sure, there are still plenty of technical and political details need to come to an agreement between nations to make all these happen. In fact,Dubai airport is going to make seamless entry a reality. Let’s see how long we need to say goodbye to our passport!

Every minnow having a dream of building an army of followers, receiving tons of votes, and of course, making a decent income. There is only one way to get all these done, which is persistently creating value here. And I know this going to take time.

What happened?? First thing came to my mind was ‘a whale must have said a hello to me’. This was quickly confirmed by checking the short list of voters. And soon I noticed my reputation has increased. From 36 to 41. 13块! 到底发生了什么？ 第一个想到的就是“一定有只鲸鱼刚刚向我打招呼了”。那短短的点赞名单肯定了我的想法。很快的也发现我的名声从 36 上到了 41. Hell yeah! 太他*爽了!That feeling when you found out the hard work paid off, nothing can describe it. I was awed the moment all this happened, dozens of excited thoughts flashed. “God this really works!” “Making money never been this easy!” “May be full time writer career is not so infeasible?” “Man I gotta write more!” 当你发现付出得到回报时，那种感觉是无法形容的。当下发现这一切时，各种念头不断闪现而过。 “我的妈这真的能行！”“赚钱好容易啊！”“来专业作家的梦也不是那么遥不可及嘛？”“来料真的要写多点料！” “Haha, silly” “呵呵，真傻”I might have said that looking back from a few years from now. May be for now I was fussing for the reward. May be the reward amount was not worth mentioning. But at least, the reward was real, the motivation was solid. Nothing feels better than the sense of achievement. I shall keep this momentum going! 可能几年以后往回头看，我会这样说。可能我现在有点小题大做了。可能那一点点的回酬微不足道。但是起码，那回酬是真实的，随之而来的动力也是实在的。 没什么比成就感更令人鼓舞了.把这动力保持下去吧！共勉之 Credit to Mr.MyFirstWhale @teamsteem do follow him for his awesome posts!

Outline with soft stroke to avoid unwanted lines to be overwhelmingly obvious at the end of the drawing. 2. Backbone is everything in a sketch. Now heavy stroke can be used. 3. Simple shading to give basic 3D feeling to the petals. Gives a better idea of the flower structure. 4. Fine tuning the shadow with different strength of storkes. 5. Touch up the stem and leave. 6.

A red packet will normally be blessed to the newborn(locally referred as ‘angpau’) which consist of a random amount of cash. As the newly appointed uncle, I’ve decided not giving my newborn the traditional cash, when there are so much of interestingly potential cryptocurrency out there! 祝我的小侄儿桉桉仔，满月快乐！根据华人传统，古人认为婴儿出生后存活一个月就是度过了一个难关。这个时候，家长为了庆祝孩子渡过难关，都会举办满月酒，或是封个红包祝愿新生儿健康成长。 作为新上任的二叔，我决定了不包传统的红包！ Advantages of not gifting the old-fashion cash 虚拟币取代传统红包的好处 Encourage adoption for cryptocurrency My brother and his wife will get the chance to learn about the cryto-world. How to restore a wallet, how to perform a transaction, how to secure the coins and much more. They might end up growing more interest in this new technology and bring it to more people. Or they will just learn just enough to safe keeping the current holdings. Either way is beneficial to the ecosystem. Interesting way of gifting Instead of the boring cash which can be spent within a blink of an eye, gifting cryptocurrency to the laymen can spark some sort of fun. New skills could be learned, comments can be exchanged. Huge potential of value I told my brother, keep the recovery seed for your son and treat it as the ticket to the Millions. Keep it safe for a couple of years, recovery it to see the value when my nephew is a few years older. At that moment, the value attached to the seed can worth a total zero, or it can worth a million. This may sound exaggerating, but everything is possible in the crazy crypto-world. 鼓励虚拟币普及化 大哥大嫂就有机会接触到虚拟币的世界。如何恢复电子钱包，进行交易，保护钱币，还有更多。他们最后可能对这新科技产生更浓厚的兴趣，从而把新资讯带给更多的人。也可能只学会如何保障既有的虚拟币。无论怎样，这对虚拟币的世界都是一件好事。 送礼变得更有趣 送虚拟币给外行人比起传统的现金更能激发不同的火花。不同的资讯能够被交流，彼此也能交换不同的意见。 巨大的升值潜力 我告诉我哥，把这后备种子保护好，把它当作你儿子通往百万之路的门票。保存个好几年，当我侄儿长大了再打开来看。那时候，可能钱包里头的价值已经为零，或者，那些虚拟币已经值得百万！听起来有点夸张，但虚拟币的世界没什么是不可能的, 不是吗？ Prepare the paper wallet 创造纸钱包I chose Exodus wallet. They support BIP39 which using a 12 Word Mnemonic backup seed and I think this is good for small amount of holdings and beginner friendly. The same 12-word seed can be restored to other BIP39 wallet like Jaxx wallet in case Exodus run out of business. Myetherwallet is a solid option for paper wallet as well but only ERC-20 tokens are supported. 我选择了Exodus wallet。它们支持 BIP39 来生成十二个字的助记码。这种钱包很适合新手也适合少量的虚拟币储存。这十二个字的助记码能够在同样支持BIP39的钱包里恢复，譬如Jaxx wallet。同时Myetherwallet也是纸张钱包的一个不错的选择，但它们只接受ERC-20的币种。 1.Download the wallet according to your operating system. They currently support Windows, Mac, and Linux. These are the coin currently supported in this wallet. Send some coins first before we proceed to the backup step. 下载相应运行系统的钱包，现已支持Windows，Mac 和 Linux。 如图所示这是所有支援的币种。备份之前钱包里头必须不能使空的，先把虚拟币寄过来。 2.I’ve picked EOS, Ethereum, Golem, and Litecoin. They all add up to $75. Let’s hope they are going to the moon in years to come! 我选择了EOS, Ethereum, Golem and Litecoin。 目前为止加起来共值75美元。希望以后能节节上升！ 3.Set password for the first time. Write this password down on a paper for this is the key to unlock the wallet in your computer. 创建密码，并在纸上记录下来。这密码是用来把钱包在电脑上解锁。 4.Now we’ve come to the critical step. You must write this recovery phrase down and never store it in any digital form. Who owns this 12 word owns everything inside this wallet! Make sure you keep it safe as there is no way to recover it. 最关键的一步。 一定要把这十二个字按次序抄在纸上，并且不要用任何电子形式储存。 要知道，谁拥有这备份种子谁就拥有钱包里的一切！请确保种子的安全，丢失了就没办法追回了。 5.Send the backup to your email and backup process is completed. However, you can choose to delete the email thoroughly as I mentioned never store the seed in any digital form. 把备份寄到自己的电子邮箱就备份完毕。要是你担心这增加了种子暴露的风险，也可以完全删除这电子备份，不是说过了不要用任何电子形式储存备份吗？ 6.I wrote the 12 words seed down with some simple guide and time stamps. 我把十二个助记码与一些简单的时间记录在纸上。 7.Put it inside the red packet, done! 放入红包，好了！ How to restore wallet in computer 如何在电脑中恢复钱包1.Open the wallet and click on restore. 打开钱包，点击恢复 2.Input the 12-word backup phrase。 把之前备份的12个字输入进去。 3.Gotcha! 恢复成功！ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Gift cryptocurrency instead of old-fashion cash 不要再把现金当红包了’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/gift-cryptocurrency-instead-of-old-fashion-cash/"},{"title":"How to choose your first mechanical keyboard","text":"I’ve heard much mysterious myth about how a mechanical keyboard can take your typing experience to another level. However, despite being a computer lover myself, I’ve spent most of my computing life on laptop thus found no need for another dedicated keyboard. Until lately I decided to upgrade from laptop to desktop PC. I’ve spent plenty of time on researching every single piece of the rig component. Keyboard has been one of the most time-consuming part I’ve spent on. Following are the main factors to be considered when you are going for your first mechanical keyboard. Keyboard size and layoutFirst, you have to decide which keyboard size and layout (from top to bottom in the picture): Full-layout/100% (with numpad and arrow/navigation keys) Tenkeyless/87% (no numpad, but with arrow/navigation keys) Compact/60% (no numpad or arrow/navigation keys) Besides this three forms, there are some other form factors like 90%, 75%, 70%, or even 40% (refer to picture below) which I personally think is pretty ridiculous. These are mainly meant for the niche market. May be you can recall how often you will need to use the numpad, function key row, or navigation keys. For a gamer, the numpad is not important. For data entry job, one cannot live without the function key row and navigation keys. Depends on what you intent to do with the keyboard, a suitable size can not only save you some space on the desk but increase the aesthetic of your desktop. Mechanical switchesThe next decision is which type of mechanical switch for the keyboard. Switches represent the soul for a mechanical keyboard and that spells the biggest difference from membrane keyboard. Under every key there is an individual switch responsible for single letter input, they often provide tactile feedback and audible “click-clack” sound during typing. Main characteristics of switches: Tactile/Linear: Tactile switches provide additional tactile feedback as the key actuates, imagine there is a bump in the middle of the switch when pressing down. Linear switches have a simpler operation, they moving up and down without additional tactile feedback. Clicky/Non-clicky: Clicky switches add a louder “click” sound along with the tactile bump allowing a more noticeable feedback. Actuation force: Heavier switches require more actuation force to bottom out a key which makes the switches feel stiffer. If you hadn’t owned any mechanical keyboard before, I’d suggest you to spend more time finding the best switch type that suits you the most. Test switcher is the best thing that will let you get a feel for what each switch type feels like and how they sound. Also, they are not expensive. Amongst variety brands on the market, Cherry MX switch is the most popular option in most places. We are not going to discuss rare switches like Topre, Gateron, ALPS, or any other switches as they are less common. Cherry MX Mechanical Key Switch comparison: Cherry MX Blue: Tactile and clicky. Loudest sound and distinct tactility provide most outstanding mechanical keyboard experience. Good for typing but caution to be used in shared working spaces. Cherry MX Brown: Tactile and non-clicky. Lighter version of Blue switch without the audible click. Good for the beginner. Cherry MX Black: Linear with high actuation force. Good for gaming with stronger typing force. Cherry MX Red: Linear with low actuation force. Good for gaming and typing while allowing rapid keystrokes.

Nike logo in suede leather feeling. The short strap does help in tightening fore foot but I don’t utilize this too much as I have fatter fore feet already. But they do complement in the aesthetic and I love how the little bluish tag highlights the overall look. Tongue-less design offers a complete wrap-up feeling PG’s personal signature at the inner sole, which I don’t think can survive for even a game.(And I was right, brushed completely off after a game session) Outsole in my favorite brown color and PG logo at the middle.

This thought is particularly serious in the Chinese circle. Parents work hard to bring up the children, apart from hoping for them to succeed in their own life, that is, hope that the children can be grateful to feed back the parents when they are old. In some way, raising a child become an investment, you expect the assets to be able to produce a return on maturity. Oh did I make the warm parent-child relationship sounds snobbish? It is snobbish if the parents raise the children in the expectation of return. But don’t get me wrongWell, we must be grateful to our parents. Without a single doubt, I believe that it is our born responsibility to support our parents.My parents are typical of the older generation. They are not highly educated, started working at a very young age in all kinds of work. With the hard-working essence of the previous generation, my parents provided me a great family without shortage of food and clothing. I’m able to grow up healthily under their selfless contribution of years. They may not have much, but absolutely unconditionally put all the dedication to the family. Take my dad for an example, he used up all his retirement fund for the down payment of our only house, just for the sake of the children can live better with the mortgage when he is no longer with us. Financially he gave us all he had, and keep his way closed for a retreat. I’m speechlessly thankful for all of these and hopefully can repay them in every way I can. Control the rest of your lifeWestern liberalism is worth learning in this aspect. Parents bring the child to this world and strive to cultivate him, that is, in order to let him have the idea of independent thinking, and eventually become an independent individual.How many houses or money does the father own is not related to the son. The father is unashamed even he decided to spend it all and don’t leave a cent for the son. He owes his grown up son absolutely nothing. Relatively, parents shouldn’t take the support from their child as granted. If they are doing well and being grateful to their parent, that would be a happy ending. On the contrary, if they already struggling to make a living themselves, the unattended aged parents will be a social problem. This is not an uncommon news on daily basis. In the lower social class, it is not hard to see many of the poorly educated parents, they live a lowly life due to their mediocre inaction but raising a horde of children in the hope of their children can bring a better day for them. On the other hand, they aren’t willing to invest in the child’s education, letting them grow up ‘naturally”. The truth is chances are slim for the children to succeed in the society under such an ill-upbringing. Be a free old manYoung people should strive to make money, never spend beyond the mean, and invest the difference. Considerable wealth is not far away if the said process is repeated again and again. At the same time you will have to access the risks and unknowns of future, thereby invest wisely in the insurance and retirement plans. With the right mind of not relying on anybody at any stage of your life, dignity at the old age can, therefore, be guaranteed. I don’t wish to be rich and take care of the world, but to go well with myself when I’m old.

The friendly price tag put things in the sweet spot between budget and quality. As much as you may refer this is merely for the beginner due to the low price, the quality is not compromised at all. UnboxingSolid packing + thick self-absorption wrap = perfect dent-free box Simple transparent dust cover Drevo Excalibur is a 75% keyboard with 84-key. This layout can be found mostly in laptop keyboard. Personally, I found this layout works best for me as I can get the Function key row and navigation keys while keeping the layout as compact as possible. Together with the borderless full metal body, granted this keyboard a really minimal and clean style. The floating-key design makes things feel futuristic and you will be grateful for that when you are cleaning the keyboard. Dust and hair can be easily cleaned even without removing the keycaps, a simple air duster will make it clean like new. One of the great points is that the keycaps are using double-shot technique in ABS material. The official claims that the keycaps have enhanced texture to prevent keys from getting greasy. But we can only tell over the time. It does bring a better feel than those normal keycaps I’ve been used.However I’m not a fan of the too boastful font in gaming accent, but I can always get another set of keycaps and customise it. This keyboard comes in 2 colors which are black and white. White version really makes the perfect match with the black extended mouse pad. It also has white LED backlit with a couple of stunning lighting effects: Breathing mode Snake marquee mode Reactive mode Advanced reactive mode VerdictI’ve chosen the famous Red switch and I’m glad about the decision. It doesn’t produce loud click-clack sound that might be annoying to the surrounding while providing a solid feedback. Solid build quality, rich in features, and you just can’t ask more at the $65 price tag. So far I’ve typed most of my Steemit posts with this gem and I couldn’t be happier with the experience.

Steemit送了我一个机械键盘","text":"Love this gift! Last post I’ve shared the unboxing and review of my first mechanical keyboard. I’ve just registered in Steemit not long ago when I received my keyboard in a parcel. And as a young Steemian I already actively seeking for ideas to write about and tends to start recording everything potentially interesting that could be shared in the future post. I decided to record down the unboxing process of this new toy. From peeling off the package, taking photos in different light conditions, to the live lighting effect demonstration. This doesn’t take much of my time and I enjoyed the whole process. After one month of using it as my daily tool, I think it’s about the time I should make a review post of the keyboard. Though it is my first ever unboxing post of a product and it might not as deep as those from the pros, I tried my best to make it as interesting as it can be. Within the first day after the post is uploaded, as usual I monitored the reactions the post has received at the same time doing some self-examination. “Hmmm, it is gloomy like always.” “May be I shouldn’t put the ‘keyboard’ as the first tag, who cares about keyboard here?” “The phone-taken photos must be too dull for a good photo.” And then the magic happenedOut of nowhere, a couple of whales just happened to drop some heavy votes on the post. those votes jumped me from reputation 45 to 50 and earned the post a hundred dollars. The next morning, the post gained 70 something more votes due to the initial visibility boost. It ended up like this A jaw-dropping(to me at least) $123 and 90 votes. You have to know the highest I’ve achieved in a single post is just 10 plus dollars and less than 30 votes. And what makes the whole thing even greater? The moment I realized I’ve just earned a free keyboard from its unboxing article! According to the steemstats, the author will take 91.457 SDB (45.729 SBD + 33.773 SP) in reward. Assuming 91 SDB is priced at $1, I still earn an extra $26 after deducting the price of the keyboard which is $65. This is plain amazing especially for someone who has joined a new community not more than 2 months. Though this is likely the result of major luck, I’m absolutely convinced by the power of Steemit. 在上篇分享了我第一个机械键盘的开箱和评测。 在我注册Steemit不久后就收到了这键盘的包裹。尽管在Steemit入世未深，我已经开始了不断寻找灵感的习惯。也慢慢的开始记录一切有趣的材料，好让以后的创作更有效有趣。 所以我记录了这新玩具的开箱过程。从拆开包裹，不同角度的摄影，到录下那些酷炫的灯光效果。整个过程相当有趣而且花不了我多少时间。 在一个月的使用之后，该是时间写个评测文章了。虽然这是我第一个开箱评测文，也许没有那些大神们的文章那么深入，我尽可能的让整个文章更真实和有趣些。在上传后的一天里，我如常的观察所收到的反应同时也做出些自我检讨。 “嗯,还是一样的反应惨淡啊” “或许我不该把‘键盘’放成第一个标签？这里没人在乎键盘的课题吧” “用手机拍的照片果然是不够吸引人啊” 然后奇迹发生了 有好几十只鲸鱼不知从哪里冒出来给我投了票。而这些票数不知让我的声望从 44 升到 50， 还让文章赚了一百块。第二天早上，由于先前的巨票效应该文章再度增加了近 70 个票数。 最终成了图一的模样。 让人大跌眼镜（起码对我而言是的）的 123元和 90票的成绩。必须知道我在这之前我最高的成就才区区十几元和少过三十个票而已。还有一件事是比这个更振奋人心的？那就是我意识到了该篇文章让我赚了一个免费机械键盘！ 根据 steemstats 的数据我将收到 91.457 SDB (45.729 SBD + 33.773 SP) 的稿费。如果把SDB估价在一元，扣除了键盘的 65元 我还额外赚了21元。 这对一个加入不到两个月的新人而言是完全不可思议的。虽然这起事件很大的成分上是运气作祟，但我已毫无保留的相信了Steemit的力量。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Thanks for the free keyboard, Steemit!

It has to be mounted with the E27 connector and this is where Ikea Tertial work lamp comes in. 小蚁的Yeelight智能灯泡是个能变1600万种颜色的好玩灯泡，虎视眈眈已久的我终于入手了一个。生活在一个租来的房间里，这个小小空间就是我的睡房和工作室。奈何天花板的白光吸顶灯太醒目了，不适宜作为休息放松的好光源。我需要一些能够提供柔和光线的灯具同时也不能太贵，当然灯具本身也需要有点逼格才行。Yeelight智能灯泡如果不用连接app直接使用也是没问题的。但要是配合小米之家的app，各种好玩的东西就可以开始了。它使用的接口是E27，所以就有了接下来登场的Ikea Tertial啦！https://steemitimages.com/DQmSskpfRmSY4LU3CRG6mJ8gPCPp3ouYvZfUamVrqf4UMux/2.jpgTertial is a perfect choice for wall and table mounting lamp with classic steel design. The adjustable arm and head make it so flexible to direct the light into any corner in the room. Either pointing it to the desk for more concentrated work or shoot it up to the ceiling for soft brightness all over the room by reflection(love this method).Tertial 是宜家一款能够装在桌上和墙上的灯具。经典的钢铁设计，可调动的臂弯和灯头都让它成为我的上上之选。把灯具射向书桌好进行一些需要高度专注的工作，又或是照向天花板让反射的光线制造一室柔和的光，我个人非常喜欢后者。Installation breakdown 安装过程Typical simplistic XiaoMi packaging using only paper material. Comes with a small instruction notes on app connection later. The bulb itself feels solid and heavier than normal bulb as wifi module is included inside.典型的小米包装，全部使用纸材料，足够环保。随之而来的还有本小册子指导如何使用app链接。灯泡本身感觉很扎实也比一般的灯泡来得重，应该是里头的无线信号与灯控系统所致。手感不错。The Tertial has several components which the assembling is as easy as Lego.Tertial 灯具就如一般的Ikea家具般简简单单就可以完成安装。Yeelight bulb fits perfectly in the bowl.Yeelight 灯泡的完美融入。White light mode 白光模式After successfully connecting the Mi Home App to the bulb, you can now start to play with the lighting. In the white light mode, we can adjust the light temperature from 1700 to 6500k. Below is the minimum and maximum temperature respectively with the app control page. The higher the temperature the more yellowish.成功连接了小米之家app后，就可以开始各种测试了。白光模式可以调动从 1700 到 6500k 的色温，色温越高颜色越暖。下图是最低和最高色温的对比，旁边的是app调动画面。Default mode will be on if using without the app, brightness and color temperature will at the highest level.如果不用app，默认模式会被启用。光度和色温都会是最高的。Colorful light mode 颜色模式https://imgur.com/DgcMbdi.gifThe bulb features 16 million colors customization and you can control it at your will for various color according to your mood. Be it the blue light for movie time, warm yellow light for reading and red light for some romantic moment. Below is the focus shot on the green, red and blue light effect of the bulb. And the GIF is showing a full cycle of color in breathing mode.小蚁灯泡具备了1600万种颜色的变色功能，能够自定义喜欢的灯光场景。不管是影院模式的蓝光，阅读模式的暖光，还是浪漫情调的红光，它都能够胜任。GIF展示了全部颜色循环的呼吸模式。Verdict 后记There are a lot more features packed into the app. You can:Set sleep timer so the light will shut off after the certain countdown period.Turn on and off the light without leaving your comfy bed!Combine with another accessories, you can customize a time plan for the bulb on when to turn on and. But this feature is only available in the China region.I personally found the combination of Smart Bulb and Tertial work lamp works great for me. I can achieve all light condition with just a single light bulb and this setup just cost me less than $30 in my region.此小小灯泡还有更多的功能，譬如：睡眠倒数自动关闭模式，开关灯不再需要下床！还有配合小米的各种周边产品时能够自定义灯泡开关的时间表，不过这功能只有在大陆才开放。我觉得小蚁灯泡和Tertial的结合是无缝的，非常适合我的需求。我可以调动各种光度和色温来配合当下的需求。再者，两者加起来花不了30美元!Links:Xiaomi Yeelight LED Bulb:https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=525169060714&amp;spm=a1z09.2.0.0.2ed6e7970CkUw5&amp;_u=821m3vh0821aIkea Tertial work lamp:http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20355434/ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘How to setup cool work lamp for thousands of light customization. 小蚁智能灯泡和Ikea Tertial的好玩结合’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/how-to-setup-cool-work-lamp-for-thousands-of-light-customization-yeelight-ikea-tertial/"},{"title":"Drawing contest of Animal: Eagle 动物绘画比赛：老鹰","text":"This artwork is a pencil drawing and took me about 45 min to complete.

Everything started off Y wanted to celebrate her girlfriend in a deluxe suite in Singapore but mostly were reserved due to the busy holiday season. So Y “had no choice” but to settle with one of the private yacht services he could find. Told you he is rich. 托我女友的福，她的土豪朋友，Y，邀请了我们去参加他女友在游艇上的庆生会。首先，这只是个简单的庆生会，并不是你想象中的好莱坞式的游艇派对，各种比基尼美女和源源不绝的饮食提供，抱歉不是这回事。为何选择在游艇上？皆因 Y 想在新加坡寻找一间豪华的酒店套房来帮女友庆生却因为假期高峰期很多酒店都客满了，所以他“无奈之下”只好租了艘游艇。都说了是土豪吧。 A night in Ferretti 630https://img1.steemit.com/500x500/https://steemitimages.com/DQmcPXqhvt3YjbWF5NPW1FwkHhQYT5yHyG4iya2myUqfUpF/1.PNG We only spent a night on this Ferretti 630.

But it doesn’t mean much if your goal is just to finish the book, or claim that you read 200 books a year. Which may sound you have put your time to good use, but it is all worthless if you never apply what you’ve learned from the books. I’m not an avid reader but I’m on my way trying to be one. Often I found that most of the books I’ve read didn’t leave many impressions unless some quotes are so interesting that I noted it down and deliberated it for some time. And when I reread some of the books I discover some noteworthy points to ask myself that why I don’t have the memory of it at all after the first read? From now on I will start to write a simple review of every book I’ve completed. This can help me to summarize the contents better, make sure I don’t miss any highlight-worthy points and have a better memory of it hence higher chance to take it into the application. To the others, this might gave them a brief idea what this book is about which they might eventually become a reader of it, or they can just share the information without having to go through the whole book. You dont need a new and special idea to earn a million Plenty of everyday businesses, run by everyday, ordinary people, make extraordinary money. This is the primary idea of this book. All you need is a tried and true business model that already existed. Truth is there is always unconsumed demands in the market of the “traditional” business like car washing and cake making. Pick an ordinary idea and truly execute it with proper planning. Any average Joe can make his first million in 3 to 7 years. When it comes to working for yourselves, there are several businesses you can pick from. Buying existing business, buying a franchise, even joining a Multi-Level Marketing, the author recommends none of the those but creating your own company. The author also comparing the online business and traditional business. While the latter is preferable for first time entrepreneur, being digitally savvy is a huge competitive advantage. Start a real business and use the web a tool in your toolkit. You dont need money–you can be completely broke If your goal is to get $1,000,000 in the bank, you don’t need to raise millions to start your business. Raising fund is not a headache or myth if you know where to look for. Where the Money comes from: Getting a bank loan, mainstream way of raising money Crowdfunding, lesser risk and can be quick if your business idea is promising. Peer-to-peer lending (P2P), this can be useful to small and medium businesses that usually have difficulty securing a loan from a bank. Friends and family, with the already established trust they can be the easy target of your potential investor. But use with caution or this may destroy your network. Personal savings, easiest since you have to rely on the others however you will have to bear the full risks as well. Or you can even spot the investors right in front of you. They are everywhere. They sit beside you at the barbershop or beauty salon. They’re in the waiting room at the dentists;s office. They’re standing in line behind you at the bank. The author has developed a habit that he can turn to anyone even in the elevator. For example, he once met a wealthy gentleman in the car wash waiting room and they exchanged contact information after some delightful chatting. This will not always work but if you are polite and decently confident, chances are you will turn the conversation into an investor willing to back your business idea. Take the g*ddamn action Creating a business requires a big picture perspective and a willingness to make a long-term investment of your time and resources. The biggest obstacle to success may just be getting started. Did you ever imagine that you can quit your 9-5 job and commit fully to work for yourself? You had some great business idea that you think may potentially change your life and grant the lifestyle that is you dreaming for? Most people do, but the majority of them never take actions too. Thus your ship will never come in, you have to swim out to meet it. In contrast, don’t get so fired up about your new business idea that you quit your day job so you can go full force with it. The wisest idea is to start the business in your off time while still holding your current job. Only to quit the job when the time comes, and quit in good term. You never know who might help you in the future. This book civilize the unattainable entrepreneurshipThere are much more solid words you can find in this book but I have to summarize only what matters to me the most or it will be too long for this post. Get the book if you are interested. I appreciate the author present the idea that starting a successful business in such a real and authentic manner. He explained many real-life cases that even a undereducated person can run a business and pocket his first million within 10 years. Practical advises are given, solid guides are well presented.

I’ve mentioned that I dislike the original keycaps of my first mechanical keyboard and finally it’s time to make a change. Due to the fact that my 84 key Excalibur has some non-standard keys like the right Alt and Ctrl in 1.0u size instead of the standard 1.25u, I got a hard time finding compatible keycaps set but I finally managed to order a set of custom keycaps from the almighty Taobao. The keycaps are in Dolch color and made of thickened PBT which will be much more resistant than the original ABS keycaps. The whole package costs 168 RMB, kind of a reasonable price for beginner customization. 换键帽本身就是机械键盘的一大特色。之前提过我不太喜欢我第一个机械键盘的键帽，太倾向游戏式的风格了。现在是时候了。 由于我的84键的Excalibur有好几个键是不标准的，譬如右边的 Alt 和 Ctrl 键是 1.0u 的（标准的是1.25u），寻找自定义的键帽时时常会遇到困难。幸亏有万能的淘宝，始终还是让我找到了。 这套键帽是用加厚的PBT材质来制造，会比原装的ABS键帽耐打油得多。价格是168人民币，对入门级的键帽来说也算是友善的了。 Meet the Dolch customized PBT keycaps Simple package and the keycaps are well positioned on a foam. This helps to avoid collision inside the box which might hurt the keys.&gt;简单的包装，键帽都很好的固定在海绵板上，有助于避免运输过程中键帽的互相碰撞。 Also come with a keycap puller to make the work later much handy. 赠送的拔键器，待会可是很实用 Feaures OEM height and sided letter for Win, Esc, and Alt key. 键帽用的是OEM高度 Get the work started Slide in the key puller and pull it straight up.

This might seem easy but I found this is quite tiring as it takes time. And you better not to mess up the order of the keys as you will have hard time tracing them back. 新键帽植入当中。整个过程看起来容易但其实也颇有难度的。记得必须要保持键帽的次序，否则可有得你头痛了 Completion, satisfaction. Love the color combination of grey, black and the little red. I may need to switch other significant keys like the Enter or arrow keys to red. 灰黑一点红的配色实在是不错。我想以后在增加红色的比例在重要的键上，例如Enter和方向键。 This is how it looks when the LED backlight is on in a dimmed environment. The keycaps are not transparent and since I spend most of my time typing on this keyboard at night, it is as good as blind typing since the sided letter can be hardly seen. 这是在昏暗的环境中看起来的样子。由于这键帽是不透光的，在晚间使用时几乎就等于盲打了。打开背光的LED时看起来的效果还是很好的。 I like how the sided-letter of this keycaps looks as that is the biggest reason for I selected these custom keycaps. Absolutely minimalistic looking from the top while the letters lurking at side providing casual hints what letters it is. At the same time, I can really start practicing my blind typing skill. 字母侧刻是这套键帽最大的特色，也是我选择它的原因。从上面看来几乎是光滑无字的，简洁非常。侧刻在前字母又可以在适当的时候作为提示，不愧是锻练盲打的神兵！ Keyboard-related posts:How to choose your first mechanical keyboard Best mechanical keyboard under $100: Drevo Excalibur unboxing This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Changing keycaps on mechanical keyboard 机械键盘变身之–换键帽’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/changing-keycaps-on-mechanical-keyboard/"},{"title":"Super-Villain drawing: The Venom 超级反派之毒液","text":"I’ve spent 2 hours on this.

Tonight at 00:00, the owner of A will be given the equivalent amount of new object B. No one can predict the price of B and because the appearance of B, the price of A will fluctuate aggressively. In the given facts, we have 2 questions: 1)If you already have 5 A, what will you do? 2)If you don’t have any A, but with a $15000 investment fund in hand, what will you do? You might probably know I’m describing the BTC fork at the 1st August. I took this question to those who aren’t familiar with cryptocurrency and the result is kinda interesting. 1) Withhold of 5 A, most of them will sell off 2-3 A and use the rest to claim the free B. This decision is obvious and reasonable to me, reduce the risk yet maintain the position to get more reward. 2) Without holding any A, surprisingly only a few are willing to take this chance to buy some A to claim the free B. Maybe my access objects are conservative. I’m a proud aggressive investor. I’m young and I’m willing to take higher risk for greater reward. Back in the time before the fork, I had 3 BTC and I decided to leave it be,luckily it turned out to be I won the bet. A friend of mine was exactly in the condition (2). Holding some cash equal to 3 BTC, considering whether to buy the BTC before the fork or not. Finally, he bet that the price will sure crash since there was a huge rumor saying the recent surge of BTC was due to man buy-in for the ‘BTH lottery.

Expect to win from a casinoFirst of all, the casino is a big business. All the games you can find inside were the result of actuarial science by a bunch of mathematicians. Given sufficient amount of rounds, most players are going to join the losing site thanks to the statistic which granted advantages to the home. You can win in short term but not long term. Acknowledge this fact and you will stop to fantasize bringing out piles of cash from a casino. The right way to enjoy in a casino is equipping the “have fun” mindset. You can long to win but don’t take winning as granted. There are a lot of fun in the process too. Take the Blackjack as an example, we can have fun by analyzing the edge of each hand, apply different strategies to maximize our advantage or to fold or split the cards. After all, the casino is a business of entertainment, of course winning is good but losing is expected as well. Do not want to be frightened by a Horror movie“I don’t pay to scare myself, bro.” We all have such friends who don’t enjoy the horror movie and that is the sentence I heard the most from them. What is the ultimate goal of a horror movie? To frighten the audience. We expect the laughter when we watch the comedy. Expect to go into the detective mode and reasoning with the characters in the mystery film. For the action movie, we love the adrenaline rush by the fierce fighting. And what do you expect watching the horror film if not to get frightened? Laughing the whole 2 hours just like you were watching the comedy? I love horror films. I enjoy to be frightened by a well-planned plot and that is how I decide if the ticket is worthwhile. Steemit is going to make me richI believe this the biggest myth in Steemit yet many will fall for it, I wasn’t an exception. It was really bitterly disappointing to see the others earn hundreds easily every post while your 4-hour-worth of the article just sink to the bottom of the sea. And soon I realized my motivation was all about money, which is not appropriate at all. There are bunches of advantages we can develop using a platform like Steemit. Training the idea muscle, improving writing skills, keeping a personal journal, and so on. When I found the balance between expectation and rewards, the motivation becomes natural again.

Typing on my first mechanical keyboard does help the new blogging life a lot. I’ve been cutting down the frequency of a leisure walk in the mall, because spending that time on a new blog is in the higher priority now. 但我不能一直和电脑一起 But I can’t always stick with my desktop由于我在外地工作（新加坡）， 每个月总有几天需要回家乡（马来西亚）。刚换的台式电脑得到强劲性能的同时，也完全失去了之前笔记本的便携性。往来两地，唯有手机随身矣。虽然手机在操作市场和写作上还勉强可以凑合，但也实在是很不方便。 Since I’m working in Singapore, I often travel back to my hometown, Malaysia few times in a month. Traded the portability of notebook with try performance of desktop pc, smartphone is the only device travel with me now. Trading and blogging on it is such a struggling mission. 于是就有了买平板电脑的想法 The thought of buying an tablet kicks in Microsoft Surface 是目前的最佳人选。融合了两大优点于一身：屏幕大，让交易操作更容易，windows也可以轻松处理多重任务；可加载键盘，让写作更有效率。 而且还有电子笔和触屏特性组合也可以让我开始学习最学很久的数码艺术（digital art)。一举多得啊。 A tablet have a big screen makes trading a breeze and try detachable keyboard would type better than on the phone. Furthermore I can start to pick up the long-wanted skill in digital art. Microsoft Surface series is a great match so far. 但是花钱不能这样任性 But we shouldn’t at our free will之前在Quora上看过一个很好的分享： 在你决定买一样东西之前，就算你可以直接买下，也不要这么做。相反的，你应该现在就开始存钱，直到够钱为止。 这样做的好处是： 有效的阻止冲动购物。很多的直接购物行为都免不了冲动的成分。很多人一定试过，在购物广场看上的某件很喜欢的货物，二话不说就买下了，到后来才发现其实没什么用处。这样的‘存钱才买’方式就是解药。等到你存够了钱，发烧的脑袋已经冷静了不少，到时就会再度考虑自己是否真的需要这东西：依然想买的话，很大成分这就是你真正需要的东西；否则，你就无端存起了一笔钱。无论如何获利的都是自己。 This is a random wise advice from Quora: When you have got a new stuff to buy, don’t buy it even you can afford it right now. Instead, start saving up for it. By doing so, good chances you can eliminate the potential impulsive spending. We bought what we wanted during causal shopping and regret with the purchases after some days. To stop wasting money on impulsive shopping the key is not to act the moment we would like to own that item. Make it a goal and start saving towards it. Two things is gonna happen when you have enough money: if you still want to buy it, likely you are really needing it; if you lost the interest already, congratulation that you have just skipping the unnecessary spending at the same time accumulated small wealth in the pocket! 所以我也设定了一个有趣的存钱方式 So I came up with a interesting way to save up那就是我在Steemit的收入必须达到购买Surface同等的数目的时侯，才可以出手购买。这样除了可以给我动力继续不断的创作，到时赚到了目标收入时也可以再度审核此刻的购物欲是否理智的。因为我自己也觉得购买平板电脑这件事上，冲动的成分还是居多的，哈哈！ 当然这方式还是适合非必需品的购物居多。譬如好基友@we1even身为摄影发烧友，想升级相机很久了，就给自己定下个目标，说是必须要在任何一个摄影比赛中获奖时才能让自己下手买新相机。这未尝不是一个好方法，至少到现在为止他都还没获奖。可能近来都买忙碌事业无暇参赛还是什么别的原因，相信他当初炽热的心目前应该冷静了不少。这样的方式有效的减少了他冲动购物的成分不是吗？ 控制冲动购物欲，给自己一个目标去达成梦想，无论是购物还是做某件事情，结果都会是充满成就感的。你最近有什么想买的啊？开始存钱吧！ To buy that Surface, I must earn the equivalent amount on Steemit. This strategy not only can motivate me to keep writing, I will be able to reassess the need of a tablet. As I’m suspicious this is likely to be another impulsive buying, haha! Have anything to buy?

They could have used that free time on something else useful. You might say, they are hired to work not for the other stuff. But they are playing games on their phone anyway don’t they? I was in the same shoe when I was a teenager. This kind of part-time job is so boring that you have to prepare your own entertainment to kill the time, especially in the unloved zone. 不打游戏，那干什么呢？ What to do if not gaming? 看书:增广见闻 在自己有兴趣的领域磨练技巧，如学习coding，学习交易策略，学外语。 看有营养的视频，如Ted talk 甚至是加入Steemit，开始写作(当然他们很可能也不知道Steemit的存在) 还有很多用一个笔记本甚至手机就能做到的事情，就举例不尽了。或许你也会觉得我在打工的时候做这些有些太疯狂吧，这当然得视情况而定，如果你的工作闷得让你不得不做些事情来打发时间，那为何不做些有益处的？ Reading books, learning some skills like coding or new languages, watch educational videos like Ted Talk, or ever join Steemit and start blogging(they probably won’t realize the existence of Steemit already), and more. It takes a huge ambition for someone to be that self-improving. Learning is not easy, not everyone has a difficult goal in life. 珍惜时间 Cherish the time我并不反对玩手机，反而认为偶尔的放松是必要的。只是那些都必须是有目的性的和受控制的。这不是自以为上进，也不是有什么优越感。只是以一个曾经无度浪费时间的过来人的身份，偶有感悟而已。冷发兄@coldhair的《聊一聊工作后的学习》写的很好，犀利的指出坚持学习的重要性，实在是不能同意更多。 其实需要有如此强的学习心的人一定有个远大的目标，不会甘于只做些令人闷得发慌的工作，领那最低薪资。反之，我有我打工轻轻松松，刷刷手机就下班，还有工资拿，这样的美差事去哪里找。这两种思想没有对错，只是看你最终想要到达哪个目的地。 I’m not against gaming nor any form of entertainment to pass time.

But I wasn’t really into it. I draw when the mood come and stop whenever it stop interested me. I was good at drawing the Japan manga, Dragon Ball was my favorite. My mom spotted my talent and thought that I can use some help from art classes to develop my skills.So in the class drawing, I was. I always thought the assignments given by the tutor was too easy for me. Every time I was the quickest to finish my drawing and I would stroll around the class. One day I spotted there was a comic corner at the living room. My interest soon got attracted and since then, I finished my assignment on the class quickly just for reading more comics on the couch. Until my mom caught me bloody-handed as I made the drawing class’s fee that she paid worthless. That was my last art class ever. Since that day, whenever I occasionally started to draw, my mom would keep doubting if I can finish it. As she thought I wasn’t serious into this art stuffs. She would challenge me to finish it. But her tactic didn’t work as I was so rebellious back then. And I stopped drawing for a long time because it was not fun anymore. As I’m growing, I started to correct my misunderstanding towards the attitude of art. Creating an art should be free and fun. It can be any form of materials and styles. The truth is, I felt like I don’t have to do it to please anyone. As soon as I realized this, art creation becomes fun again. From the material collecting to sketching, coloring to framing. I could not feel the ticking of the time when a few hours was actually slipped away. Doing something so serious that you throw whole mind and body into it wholeheartedly, and anything could be enjoyable. 哈哈哈，每次看到都忍不住要笑。可以把他画成这摸样看来我才华不可小觑啊，看得出这是谁吗？？【画于中学初】&gt;Can you tell who this is?? 当初我认为世上最帅的就是华哥。【画于中学初】&gt;The most handsome guy I thought back in time, Andy Lau. 永远的李小龙，我的第一偶像。【画于中学】&gt;Bruce Lee will always be my favorite. 某同学选了艺术课却交不出功课，我仗义出手救济画的。【画于大学】&gt;I save my art class friend with this for his assignment. 英雄面具系列，登登登Spiderman！【画于大学毕业后】&gt;Hero on canvas—Spiderman! 在Steemit所参加的动物绘画参赛作品,得了第三名.【画于加入Steemit初】&gt;Entry for a contest in Steemit and ended up with 3rd prize. 超级反派之毒液，也是在这里的参赛作品【画于加入Steemit初】&gt;Another entry for a drawing contest. 这是我目前最喜爱的作品之一，挂在我家的饭厅上，怎样？看着都开胃吧！【画于大学毕业后】 I have this hanged on my living hall, appetizing isn’t it?

Despite all the complicated political and social factors, can we really equalize the wealth? Not possible as of now. Let’s do an experiment, we create an environment with equal resources distribution, same geographical location, and a fair policy: In a village, there are 100 villagers and 1000 chickens. For the purpose of wealth sharing, each one of them gets 10 chickens. The followings are likely to occur: Some of them will kill the chicken to eat whenever they are hungry, soon they will have empty the chicken they had. They will start to exchange more chicken for food with other assets. Some of them will kill the chicken to eat, but they won’t eat them all. They keep some chickens for laying eggs. The eggs will get them more chicks so that they can continue to kill the old unproductive chickens for food. Because they keep regenerating the source of food, they are self-sufficient. Some of them will kill the chicken to eat whenever it is necessary. At the same time get more chicken from the others by trading. Laying for more eggs, more eggs for more chickens. Repeating that, they will have more and more chickens to start selling to those who are in need(like the people from the first point). A few months later, 10% of the villagers own 80% of chickens, 20% own 15% of chickens, and 70% people will sharing the remaining 5% of chickens. Wealth inequality happens again. This is how our world working now. Those who are insightful put the resources to good use instead of spending them all at once. They will keep consuming at the minimal rate and invest the difference. Everything that pays off will have a harder start, spending or investing? Reading or gaming? On the contrary, the poors will focus solving the immediate problems. Kill the chickens for the hungry stomach, get the job when the pockets are empty. This can keep them survival too but provides no security in the future. Suffer now for better future, or enjoy today and leave all the worries tomorrow? 贫富悬殊一直是各个国家的问题。各国国情政策不一，产生原因也各异。尚且不讨论复杂的政治社会因素，贫富悬殊可以彻底地被消除吗？以目前世界的情况来说，很难实现。假设我们创造一个环境，哪里拥有平等的社会资源分配，同样的地理条件，一视同仁的政策： 在一个村庄里有一千只鸡，人口一百。为了财富均分，每个人可以得到十只鸡。接下来会出现以下情况： 有的人会在饿肚子把鸡杀来吃，很快的鸡就吃完了。他们就需要开始向还有鸡的人用其他物资交换以获取粮食。 有的人会在饿肚子把鸡杀来吃，但不会一下子吃清光。留下一部分鸡继续饲养，下蛋生出新的小鸡，才把生产力下降的老鸡杀来吃。这样他们虽然不会有太多的鸡只，但因为不过度消耗资源，生活倒也自供自足。 有的人只会在必要的时候把鸡杀来吃。同时也会用其他物资来像其他人换取更多的鸡只，饲养下蛋，等到更多的鸡。如此循环，他们拥有的鸡只就会持续增多，可以出售给需要的人们（第一类人）。 几个月后，可想而知的，10%的人支配了80%鸡（资产），20%的人支配15%的鸡，其余的70%的人支配剩余的5%的鸡只。贫富悬殊依然出现了。 这就是我们所在的世界，成功的人会善用身边的资源来得到更多的回报，不会一时之馋把所有鸡都吃了，相反的尽量减少花费珍贵的资源，将它们放在长远的投资上。很多会带来回报的东西开头都是没那么享受的，读书还是玩游戏？剁手还是投资？ 穷人却只会关注眼前的问题，饿了就杀鸡来吃吧。好比钱没了就去打工吧，有钱了就可以先享受，把钱花完再说。过日子的确不成问题，但手停口停的日子对未来却毫无保障。三天打鱼两天晒网，怎能不会越来越穷呢。 一时的难受换取未来的安逸，还是今朝有酒今朝醉？ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Wealth inequality is the result of humanity 贫富悬殊是人性的结果’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/wealth-inequality-is-the-result-of-humanity/"},{"title":"Money game bring me to the world of Bitcoin 庞氏骗局带我进入比特币的世界","text":"金钱游戏（Money game)或是庞氏骗局(Ponzi Shceme)，有些人也叫金字塔游戏，就是类似中国盛行的传销。所谓金钱游戏是因为参加的人们不用买卖货物，只用金钱就足以“钱滚钱”。金钱游戏的噱头不外乎: 投入一定数目的本金，在特定的时候可以好几倍的价格连本带利拿回来。低风险，高收入。 鼓吹人拉人的无极限的单向性增长。比如说每拉一个人做下线，就能从他的本金里抽成。下线再不断的发展下线，你就在家躺着都有钱赚了。 几乎有点金融常识的人都知道这是违背投资周期的影响的，完全不可行的，崩盘只是时间问题。金钱游戏赢钱的为一法门就是尽早入场，制定目标，捞了一笔后在崩盘以前全身而退。 Money games/Ponzi scheme is so popular with some obvious characteristics: Low risk, high return.

And the game evolved to switch from fiat currency to Bitcoin to avoid monitor from the banks. After all money game was sort of illegal fund-raising. I was too lazy to study this new technology and just simply registered an account on an exchange which introduced by the game master. 第一次正式拥有比特币 The first time to own Bitcoin首遇比特币 First bitcoin for me 2016年9月，游戏正式崩盘。我们小组之前放出去的资金有很大部分都拿不回来了。我最后一个收到的记得是代表600马币的 0.28723400 BTC，第一次正式拥有比特币。当时也不当一回事，因为600马币对我们最后所发放出去的资金总数来说只是很小的一部分。心痛收不回的资金对游戏的心寒，我们把两三个月里的本金和利润均分然后就解散了。我也渐渐忘记了留在那交易所的‘一点点’比特币，继续生活。 September 2016, the money game is finally crashed. Most of our last batch of an outgoing fund is not coming back anymore. The last payment from the system was 0.28723400 BTC which was equal to RM600 at the time. We split the fund together with the earnings and call it an end. I thought the Bitcoin that left on the exchange is just ‘tiny’ compared to our lost fund, so I just let them be staying on the wallet and life goes on. Bitcoin price from Spectember 2016 to April 2017 2017年4月，开始在各种新闻和社交网站上再度听到比特币的名头。原因好像是比特币状态大勇，涨了不少。记得还读到一则有些在北京的年轻人专门靠交易比特币为生的新闻。他们年入百万，似乎就是全职搞这个的，当时中国交易所应该还是零手续费的时代吧。这时比特币让我越来越好奇了，决定好好研究一下这到底是什么玩意。同时也想起了我留在那交易所的比特币，查一查价格。0.28BTC等于1200马币？印象中应该没有这么多啊。 后来再三确认，发现当初价值600（200美金）的比特币半年之后已经变成了1200（400美金）！ WTF！ April 2017, I started hearing about Bitcoin again from various source of information. Mainly due to the price spiking and how people make tons of money from it. I remembered the tiny amount of BTC I left on the exchange, logged in to make sure they are still there. And I proceeded to check the value, only to find out 0.28 BTC has become RM1200 worth. Something that worth RM600($200) doubled to RM1200($400) within half a year! I was blown away. 于是我正式进入了虚拟货币的世界 I decided to study more of it听到某某资产增值是一回事，实际感受自己的资产增值又是另一回事。由于比特币的短时间暴力大涨带给我的震撼太大，自此我就开始不断地学习和研究关于这科技的一切，从区块链到各种小众货币（Altcoins），实在是收获良多。这段日子学习了很多之前压根不会接触到知识，比如地域性搬砖需要知道当地相关的金融法规和条例。最重要的是，明白了开明的学习态度的重要性。Steemit的出现真的很合时宜，可以从各路高手的文章中汲取资讯的同时也可养成写作的好习惯。 金钱游戏不可取，过程中可能会毁灭你的人际网，最后还很可能血本无归。有过那一次不美好的经验，决不会在重蹈覆辙。但也正是这次糟糕的经验，把我带入到了虚拟货币的神奇世界里。回想起来，还是血赚的！ It was so amazing when something this unbelievable actually happened on you. I started studying everything about cryptocurrency. From blockchain to various altcoins, and all the knowledge that I wouldn’t even touch before this. I realized the importance of learning persistently. And it was a pleasure to discover Steemit along the way too. Taking part in money game was a bad experience, it could destroy your network and potentially lose all your money at the end. That was my first as well as the last. But it was this bad experience bring me to this exciting new crypto world. I would say it was worthwhile though!

Our parents used to educate us that the strangers are dangerous. Don’t date them out of the internet, don’t get on the cars that you have no idea who the driver is. The appearance of private ride services like Grab and Uber has changed the game rule. I used to take public transport to work in Singapore because the infrastructure is so convenient. It however still inferior to private car service in term of time-saving. The price war between aforementioned private ride services has brought down the cost tremendously by providing a huge promotion. As a consumer, I was glad to see his happening as I can afford the private ride as they will be even cheaper than private transport from time to time. From saying no to all the strangers, we now summon the strangers to our doorstep so that we can board their cars. The transformation was so natural and without being forced that we won’t even noticed the change. Technology has made the impossible possible. Cryptocurrency allow us to transfer fund without being charged unfairly by the banks, Steemit allows the bloggers to make their works of brain realizable. And the list shall go on.

Living in a community where the Malays are the majority race, acquiring basic Malay skills is a must or you won’t be able to read a simple electricity bill.My grandfather migrated from the southern part of China to Malaysia in the early 00’s. Our family then regard ourselves as Cantonese people. I don’t speak much Cantonese when I was young, but the Hong Kong dramas and songs taught me well on that.English is the language I learned the latest. Thanks to the 4 years in the University that English is the main conduct language, I slowly picked up this one of the most important languages before graduation. I will now rank these four languages by the actual benefits in real life to me. Ranking starts from lowest to highest. 4.Cantonese Back in the 90’s, Hong Kong culture had a huge influence in South East Asia. Due to the fact I can handle multiple languages, I have a minimum requirement in entertainments like movie and songs, that I only stick to the original audio version of the end product. If a movie is produced from HK which is originally recorded in Cantonese, I won’t bother to play the other version like in Chinese or English. Same applies to the songs. Knowing Cantonese might helps here and there but most will be in term of entertainment. Not much of real boost in real life application for me. 3.Malay I’ve mentioned not knowing the Malay language is going to be a big trouble as a Malaysian. Almost everything in this country is in Malay. However I don’t think this language will have much usefulness outside Malaysia, and I’ve been right thus far as I’m working in Singapore. However as a student, you better at least get a Credit for the Malay language subject, because that is the must-pass subject for every high school student in order to be certified that you’ve completed high school education. Or else you will feel like hell when finding a job after that. That certification is a minimum requirement in most of the jobs available on the market. 2.English I don’t have to stress more on the importance of English, you would talk in that all day in the workplace in Singapore. And mastering English allows me to have an ‘extra world’ to those who don’t. I can talk to all kind of people whenever I travel which will really enrich the content of the whole trip. Travel lover has know English as this language works from the developing countries to the developed one. Surfing global sites without pressure, from BBC to Reddit. More entertainment sources like the TV series and songs. Not to mention tons of book that only available in English version. 1.Chinese I’m always proud to use the world-most-difficult-language as my first language. In fact, I have no idea how difficult it is to when learning it. I guess it was the advantage for picking up something difficult as your mother tongue, you master it naturally without having much pain. Chinese language is so deep and profound that you can express the same meaning using long and complicated sentences as well as a few simplified words. Excuse me for not able to provide a proper example as I think the readers will need basic understandings of Chinese to get the beauty of this language. From calligraphy to poems, and to countless kind of dialects, each of every aspect will cost someone a lifetime to study.

Acquired all the peripherals except speakers. The PC is mainly for workstation works and I will spend more time playing music on it. The initial plan was to get a pair of speaker from local retailer due to the heavyweight and fragility. After some researches on Singapore forums, HiVi M200MKIII turned out to be the most recommended model. 多年的购物经验养成了“货比三家”的好习惯。二话不说，我开始浏览各大本地销售商的网站，发现价格都是居高不下，599 新币（440美金）是标准价格。这对我当初设定的预算来说是高了不少。 I’d normally comparing prices before any purchases. Started from the main local sites, the standard prices is $440 which I think there is still rooms for discounts. 那就去美国Amazon看看吧，结果还可以，355美金，比新加坡便宜了近一百块。但是看一看不是很能确定那主要卖家是否靠谱，而且这货本身重达15公斤，从美国运过来那运费会相当可观。 Amazon has it for $355, and $100 cheaper than local deals. Not bad. The problem is the unbearable shipping fee will make the deal unworthy, as the speaker is 15 kg in weight. 接下来终于要使出我最爱的某宝大法了。搜一搜，发现京东居然自营的惠威旗舰店居然只卖1199人民币（182美金）！ And you know what, proceeded to China sites and I found the same thing sales for $182! 新加坡Lazada：440 USD美国Amazon：355 USD (比新加坡便宜85)中国京东：182 USD (比新加坡便宜258) 凑巧该货物从中国运来新加坡有大优惠，只需再付不到5新币的费用，毫不犹豫就下单了。虽然这样就失去了售后保修的服务，考虑到巨大的价格优势，还有多年来海外购买电子商品绝少出过什么问题，这样的决定还是物超所值的。下一篇会介绍该音箱的开箱文。 上期分享了掌握多语言的好处，这次购物的经历就从份体现了中英双语带来的实际利益。身边有不少的ABC朋友(泛指不会阅读中文，以英文为母语的华人)，网购只能去Amazon，Lazada，eBay等英文网站获取咨询。如果我也不会中文，很可能就会在本土的销售商花两倍的钱买音箱了！ 当然不是每次中国方的价格都是最低的，有时候Amazon类的网站也有更好的优惠。所以说，多会一个语言，多一个市场。 Singapore Lazada：440 USDAmazon：355 USD ($85 cheaper than S’pore)China JingDong：182 USD ($258 cheaper than S’pore) I somehow managed to find a local shopping agent to make the shipping fee $3 flat for any item from China to my place. The huge price advantage makes the loss of warranty worthy and I shall share the unboxing article on my next post. I’ve shared the benefits of knowing multiple languages on my last post. This example demonstrates how knowing both English and Chinese can actually save you tons of money. I would pay for more than twice the price if I’m not able to read in Chinese. Of course, there are times too for English sites like Amazon and eBay to have the best deals. You gain an extra market by gaining one more language!

Those who always mess things up and make others suffer are the bad guys. The good guys will go through disasters and they always come back stronger and kick the bag guy’s arse.

And I always worry for the family of the bad guy actor when I read about them in the magazine. 蓝保 Rambo 也不懂几时开始，发现了有主角光环这种东西。以前看着主角在枪林弹雨中勇猛杀敌，手心不住冒冷汗；看他慢慢走入敌人为他设下的陷阱，心里不禁暗暗着急；看他不幸身中奸计命不久矣，眼角还会泛起了泪光。现在呢，“哎呀，他死不了的啦。”果然过不多久主角就会满血复活，在BGM的伴奏下，踏着七彩祥云把对面打的一个叫落花流水，最后抱得美人归happy ending。 The more movies I watched, the more I realize the existence of something called the Halo of the main character. It just means the main character in the movie will never die. No matter how big the trap he got in, how many bullets have hit him. He always makes perfect revenge and wins the beauty. 无间道 Infernal Affairs 这样的套路重复多了，就会慢慢想开了，看着戏里各个角色的小把戏大斗法，内心依然淡定。皆因知道好人最后一定大吉大利，坏人也难逃GG的结局。从此，固然不容易为千遍一律的编剧付出不必要的感情细胞，但也因为如此，也失去了当初心情跟着剧情高潮迭起的那种乐趣了。想想要是能回到当初那种赤子之心来看戏，应该也是应很享受的。所以有时还是会尽力量忘掉那些套路，尽量让自己投入到剧情中。不然老是以一副得道高僧看破红尘的态度来观赏影片，任戏里角色们七情上脸，看官们也丝毫不为所动，那还看什么戏？ 能破格于这种主角不死的好戏其实也有，像是Kingsmen和权力的游戏就是佼佼者。尤其是后者，真的是所谓不怕他不死，只怕你看不够久。很多重要的角色，以为他还有很远的路要走，忽然就死了；有些以为已经一死了之了，却忽然又出现了。剧情错综复杂，值得一看。 你对戏剧里的各种角色又有什么理解呢？ You become a seasoned audience after going through much routines like this. You chill out all the way through every movie because you know the goodies always get the last laugh and the baddies will end up miserably.

Buy and forget is the only way for the majority crowd to hold their Bitcoin along the bumpy road without selling. What do you think? 在Steemit混迹的玩家们都熟悉比特币是什么。不管是早期就买入比特币的玩家还是半路上车的，相信绝大多数听到比特币的发迹史时无不在想，要是当初我就买入了xxx数量的比特币就好，现在都可以退休了。然而事实真的是如此吗？ 就假设你回到了2010年，世人还对加密货币没有概念的洪荒年代。当时经济还没全面地从2008的金融海啸中恢复过来，市场一片萎顿。你也战战兢兢的守着自己不太稳固的岗位，默默的求公司不要在这个时候把你裁了。偶然在一个清闲的下午，你在网上听说了比特币。对科技敏感的你好奇之下，对这个新鲜事物展开了研究。 咦，原来想要把银行干掉，还可以把这东西当钱使啊，挺有趣的。当时一个比特币等于0.1元（美金，下同），对投资向来独有心得的你决定小赌一把，用1,000元买了10,000个比特币。根据网路上的指示，你设置好了钱包，把所有比特币都安置好后，就像其他的投资产品一样置诸脑后了。你继续了不温不火的日子，埋头努力工作。 2013年初的某个夏天早晨，你在茶餐室悠闲地喝着咖啡，看着报纸。在财经版面忽然看到比特币冲破一百大关的标题。你想起了三年前的那笔赌注，0.1元到100元，那是多少倍的增长？肾上激素猛飙，头脑飞快的计算着。1000%！他X的整整100倍！老子发财了！挡不住内心澎湃的你几乎要当场嘶吼出来。 你急急地想把手上的比特币全兑现，毕竟那1,000元的投资现在已经是100,000元了。但是转念一想，或许这玩意儿还有上升的空间？好，先卖了2,000个比特币“袋袋平安”再说，从此你开始密切关注市场的动向。终于几个月后，一下这一幕出现了。 2013年十一月间，比特币正式突破1,000大关 距离上次又上升了十倍。好家伙，看来这次我又押对了！因为尝到牛市的甜头，你对这新科技的信心与日俱增，却也同时摸不清未来的走向，沾沾自喜的你为求保险，将手上的8,000枚比特币卖了一半，剩余的一半就走着瞧吧。 此后的半年间，比特币不升反退 高峰之后随之而来的式几个大斜坡式坠落至650元到后来的400元。由于种种关于比特币的负面消息，再加上投机心态越来越重的你，开始觉得这一切不过是昙花一现的泡沫而已，自己当初不知走了什么好运搭上了这班车还昌乐好些甜头。看着不断下跌的价格，受不过心里的天人交战，通过一次次的止损已经将剩余的比特币提现了。 看到这里，我想表达的就是绝大部分早期投资者除非对比特币拥有绝大的信心，不然很少人能够撑过上述时期的大起大落，手里还能持有当初低价买入的比特币。就算你对1000元的高峰无动于衷，接下来的2,000，3,000的新纪录高峰呢？要知道当初你可是以0.1元入的手，巨大的眼前利益面前很少人能撑过这样过山车般的心路考验。 好比你今天以5,000元的价格买入了10个比特币，明年今日价格升到了50,000元一个，你会不会卖？你可能说不会，因为今时今日加密货币市场已经慢慢成为主流投资市场，铺天盖地的科普让你对比特币的理解有着很强的基础，更容易放平心态不为价格的波动所扰。但之前我们说的是比特币才横空出世不久的年代，正确的资讯可说是十分匮乏。 所以我觉得对大多数有幸能在0.xx元的价格买入比特币的人，到挨过重重考验到今日如此高价还能不动如山的，只有两种方法： 之前说过了，就是对比特币的背景技术有超强基础和信心的人，不为短暂的价格升跌所动，我相信他们就像独角兽一样稀有。 忘记自己有买过，也就是经典的Buy and Forget投资战略。唯有忘记你拥有这个投资，才不会天天盯着价格表看，随时计算着收益，时刻在打着卖与不卖的内心战。 但是买了就忘的策略其实也很难实现，因为一项投资越不受重视越容易不被放在心上。而在比特币世界，不重视往往代表货币保护功夫做的不够，到得价格大涨引起关注时，你的货币已经因为备份不足，忘记密码，甚至被黑客盗取而永不再见了。这类的悲剧在今日实在听得太多了。迟点有机会写一篇专门分享这些悲痛却有趣的真实故事。 你现在还觉得，要是当初你有幸以0.1元买入比特币，今天就可以富甲天下了吗？ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘当初买到0.1元的比特币的话，你现在就暴富了吗？ Early adopters of Bitcoin will be rich by now, really?’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/0-1cny-early-adopters-of-bitcoin-will-be-rich-by-now-really/"},{"title":"My Steemit Hero creation 创造Steemit英雄","text":"I’ve spent 1 hour on this.

What could be better if you could done fighting for your career, accumulated considerable wealth, at your peak of knowledge and experience, and about to retire with a young teenager body and energy? 年輕人，有時間，有體力，卻沒金錢中年人，有金錢，有體力，卻沒時間老年人，有金錢，有時間，卻沒體力 上面所说是普遍上全人类的心声，也是多数人一生的缩写。 正值27的我虽快赶上中年人的岁数，金钱时间体力三者的状态是介于上面所说的年轻人和中年人之间。体力的充沛程度应该是我一生中的巅峰了，平时爱好训练和篮球，时常也勇于在体能上挑战自己。时间呢，从毕业到现在工作了三年有余，进入了一个不太忙碌的事业单位，虽说工作和业余时间的平衡总也能够维持，但始终一天里还是有大部分时间必须工作。比起求学和退休时的生活，现在是没什么多余自由时间的。金钱，就是目前最脆弱的一环了。有幸近几年认识到加密货币和正确的理财观念，相信以后会在这块上慢慢加强。 总的来说，我现在是有体力，有点时间，却没金钱。 几年前有过一个有趣的想法，要是人类的发育状态能够倒转过来，上述的问题将不再困扰着人类。人类一生分为四个阶段，就是婴儿-&gt;少年-&gt;成年-&gt;老年，倒转来就是老年&gt;成年&gt;少年&gt;婴儿。 假设世间运作一切如常，一个人有80年的寿命，即一个人出生时就是现今世界80岁的状态。随着时间的增长，身体状态从80岁变成70，60，50，以此类推，直到第80年，以婴儿的形态死去。一起来看看这个逆生长的过程会是如何吧。 婴儿时期 婴儿时期指1到10岁，身体形态就像70到80岁风烛残年的老人。这个时期的人，没体力，没金钱，却有时间。 一出生就满脸皱纹，头发牙齿稀稀疏疏，脑子也不灵光，记性不好，学习能力低下。这个状态下婴儿完全无法自理，而且身体机能的衰弱，容易被各种疾病侵入，需要大人们的照顾。随着慢慢‘变年轻’，开始学会了说话，行走。脑袋因为越来越年轻，开始形成记忆，学习能力提高，对世界充满好奇。 少年时期 少年时期指10到30岁，身体形态就像50到70岁的大婶。这个时期的人，没时间，金钱渐长，体力渐长。 身体机能慢慢恢复，头发生长，由白转黑。开始上小学。学校里都是形形色色的老人家，犹如老人院一般。中学大学毕业后，大家都以比入学时更年轻的身体和满脑学术进入社会。他们寻找工作，全副时间精力都专注于工作，立志要闯出一番事业。同时间学会理财投资，慢慢累积财富。 成年时期 成年时期指30到60岁，身体形态就像20到50岁精力无限的小妮子。这个时期的人，有金钱，有体力，有时间。 这段时间是逆生长人类的黄金时段，逆生长的好处开始体现。经过上个阶段的求学过程和职场打拼后，现阶段无论学识见识，和财富累计都到了人生中最巅峰的状态，这点和现实生活中的50岁大叔没什么分别。但由于身体逆生长，身体机能也全面‘成长’至最佳状态。 此阶段很多人可能已经事业有成，家庭美满，大可以选择退休不干了。由于金钱时间体力都有，这段时间才是真正的享福时间，无论潜水跳伞，上山下海，极限运动什么都游刃有余。无论是奥运会的运动健将，夜店里狂嗨的人群，社交网站上的俊男美女，还是全世界走个遍的旅游家，都是由有钱有闲的年轻人组成的。 老年时期 老年时期指60到80岁，身体形态从20岁的青年变成1岁的婴儿。这个时期的人，有金钱，有时间，有体力。 这个过程可以正式称为返老还童。‘年轻人’们渐渐小童化，身体缩小，四肢变短变成老年小童。老年小童的知识并不会失去，也还拥有小孩般的行动能力，所以还是可以自得其乐，也可以作为大人形态的‘小年轻’们的人生导师。社交依然可以进行，两个小童谈恋爱什么的不再是早恋，而是黄昏恋。由于身体的萎缩，他们的驾照被除牌，生活开始出现种种不便。 到了第78个年头开始，也就是3岁小孩的形态。头发牙齿逐渐脱落，四肢渐渐失去力量，生活再度需要依赖别人打理。终日躺在摇篮里，需要借助仪器来表达依然清醒的神智。寿归正寝之时，小小的婴儿身躯被放入了小小的棺材。葬礼上尽是相识多年的各式各样的小孩子，小童，有些开始婴儿化的同辈则需要成人们的帮助才可以到场致敬。 一群小孩围绕着棺木，棺木里放着一个婴儿，画面太美不敢想。这样的观感也把离世的悲痛减轻了不少吧。 后记脑洞大开，不知不觉就一大篇了。年少力壮时求学赚钱，体弱多病时在病床上幻想享受，实在是人生一大讽刺，逆生长要是可以成真，就真是造福人群了。 哦对了，富二代例外。 Images from Pixabay.com This page is synchronized from the post: ‘人类逆生长狂想曲 Inverse growth is the right way for mankind’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/inverse-growth-is-the-right-way-for-mankind/"},{"title":"Drawing Challenge#7 两只酒杯 Cheers","text":"I’ve spent almost 1 hour on this.

Underneath is the object of today inside cloth bags. 粉墨登场，比我想象中还要大了点。左边的主箱带有供电系统重达8公斤，副箱则是5.8公斤。 They are bigger than I imagined. 8kg for the main speaker due to the power supply and 5.8kg for the sub speaker. 黑色尼龙网可以轻易拿下来，‘赤裸’的音响看起来也很好看，是我比较喜欢的造型。但是考虑到扬声器的保护，而且保护网本身也不难看，再加上这么贵的音响伤不起，后来还是放上去了。&gt;The protection net can be taken off easily, I personally prefer the naked look of it but due to the fact that is the most expensive speakers I ever had while the protection net isn’t looking so bad, I rather put it on.— 音响后面，左边为主箱。右边的副箱上有个铜牌，上面有惠威首席音响设计师Frank Hale的签名刻字和产品号码，看起来很高上大有木有。 The rear side of the speaker. It has a bronze badge on the sub speaker with the signature of the Hivi Chief Sound Designer Frank Hale. 号称低耗的镀金发烧音频线，第一次用这么粗的音频线和插口。线的两段都有螺丝帽，插上了拴紧，有种音质得到保证的感觉。 My first time to use such a thick speaker wire and it does convince me this thing is going to sounds great. 两个巨大音箱在旁让我的27寸Dell显示屏显得比之前小多了。长约100cm的桌面也仅仅足够容纳一对音响和显示屏，果然还是大了点，先视屏都被锁得不能弹动了。建议想要入手这音响，须有足够大的桌子空间。 These 2 huge speakers make my 27 inch Dell monitor looks smaller than they used to be. You can guess that the monitor is not swivelable anymore due to the tight spacing. Prepare a generous desktop space before buying these beasts is highly recommended. 音质方面，因为我不是音响发烧友，并不能提供什么专业的测试和评价。但是身为我所拥有过最贵最重最高端的音响，音质的优越性还是很容易就听得出来的。经过一个月多的使用感受，平时用来听音乐较多，偶尔也看看戏，此音响的处理是游刃有余的。高音清澈，低音饱满，非常适合听音乐。据厂家描述， 惠威TN25高音单元的特色是音质甜美，细节丰富，擅长诠释女声和弦乐，也正是TN25高音单元让M200有了多媒体箱中“高音之皇”的称号。 当然由于这是2.0式的音响不带subwoofer，如果你追求重低音的表现譬如重电子音乐，这音响可能不是最佳选择。 长处: 价格优惠（相对于新加坡），在这篇文章我解释了如何以少过一般的价格拿下了这宝贝。 造型经典不花俏，做工仔细，用料厚实。尤其喜欢用桦木原材制作的侧板，独一无二的水纹型纹路让外形更讨好，可以轻易融入任何主题的房间客厅。 高音卓越，低音表现也毫不逊色，听歌看戏两不误。 当摆在正确的位置，声音的临场感（near field effect）可以很明显的感觉到。即是两个音响和听者头部形成一个等边三角形时，会感觉到声音是从前面发出，而不是从两边的音响所发出。 短处： 低音相比2.1系统的音响略显单薄。 摇动主音箱时发现里头有个小零件在内部滚动，因为不影响操作所以忽略不管。 I’m no audiophile so I’m not going to show you any professional testing report. But since this is my heaviest, priciest, and highest end speaker, the sound superiority can be told easily the moment I turned it on. I use it more for music listening and casual movie streaming, this beast handles everything I throw at it with ease. Clean pitch and rich bass produce the balanced performance I like the most. Pro: Friendly price for the performance, I explained here how I got it with less than half of the price. Classic and timeless design, especially the birch raw wood side panel. Awesome performance for music and movies. Near field sound effect if you got the setup right. Con: Bass is not up to the par with 2.1 sound system. There is a little part rolling inside the main speaker box while moving. I ignored it since it doesn’t affect the operation.

What is your experience on time investment? 任何能够被花掉的物事都可以理解为投资。成功的投资，可以是花费体力把砖头从工厂搬到工地上收取了工资，或是今天买的股票下个月升了好几个百分点得到分红。失败的投资，就是花了心思脑筋去讨好一个人却得不到他的心，或是借了钱给人债主却跑路了。作为投资的资本，不论是体力还是金钱都是可以再生的，体力亏了睡一觉就能够补回来，金钱损失了下次还是能够赚回来。 唯独时间不可以。 过去十八岁　没戴表不过有时间 够我没有后顾　野性贪玩 霎眼廿七岁　时日无多方不敢偷懒 宏愿纵未了　奋斗总不太晚 – 陈奕迅《陀飞轮》 这歌词想起来还真的很适合我那些年十八岁的心态。甚至到二十四岁大学毕业的我也没有戴手表的习惯，心里隐隐觉得应该开始认真干些事情，却总是觉得时间还有很多，无妨，迟点再想。出了社会，懵懵懂懂的混了两年，体验了现实世界的残酷，才慢慢发觉原来时日无多，浪费不得。没什么大宏愿想实现，但现在开始奋斗总也不太晚。碰巧的是今年正好二十七岁。 回想起大学那段岁月，最光荣的成就即是有办法各种翘课，叫朋友帮忙签到，却总还可以临时抱佛脚完成作业，度过考试。持着小聪明，觉得自己可以比别人付出少也可以收到一样的成效，比起天资普通的确实如此。那么省起来的时间花在哪里呢？打兼职，卡拉OK，桌球游戏，找室友们玩牌作乐，最夸张的还是打游戏。 神魔之塔 Tower of Savior 那时候有个手机游戏叫《神魔之塔》的转珠游戏，红极一时。和三五好友天天乐此不疲，还开始第一次课金（充值打游戏的行为）。因为投入了大量的时间精力，我的功力可是朋友中顶级的，看对方打得糟糕时总会调侃说”懂我为什么这么厉害吗，时间花在哪里，成就就在哪里。“ 说罢还洋洋自得。这句话是对极的，可惜时间花在打游戏上不怎么妥当，何况那游戏早几年前也已经戒掉了，多厉害的技术也只待成回忆。不可不谓那是失败的投资之一。 回想起大学生涯的平均就寝时间是半夜三四点，不夸张。那些玩乐在如今看来留下了什么，当下的欢笑是真的，时间过得也是飞快的。我不会说要是当初要是如何努力做正事，现在就会怎样的更好，那是没有意义的。 把时间长期的坚持的花在同一样东西，就形成了投资行为。这些年来除了虚度光阴，还是有累积了些好习惯的。 .PNG) 坚持运动训练是从中学时期保持到现在的习惯，早已成了生活的一部分。长期的训练让身体总是充满劲道，在野球场上身体素质就好过多数人，跑的更快跳的更高，身体对抗也不容易落下风。更不用说身材健美，姿态自信会在买衣服的时候省下多少麻烦了，同样类型的衣服穿起来很容易就好看过那些白骨精。至今仍然保持两天训练一次的周期，算是目前为止收获最多的投资。、 你用时间投资了什么有趣的？ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘时间的投资 谷哥点名#12 Time investment’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/time/"},{"title":"Drawing Challenge#8 The lovely cloud 画云","text":"I’ve spent 3 days on this. Acrylics color on three 36 x 24 inch canvas, makes it the biggest art I ever make. This is an entry for a drawing contest by @helene with the theme Cloud. Cloud is erratic, dynamic, unpredictable and always changing. One can easily draw cloud in any shape and still valid because there is no shape to define how a could should look like. I have done this entry months ago as the wedding gift for my elder brother. I’m not into the traditional way of giving some cash as the token of blessing. I wished to draw something for the newly-married, but a drawing deeply themed with the wedding will only be a useful decoration during the wedding week. I want to create an art which they can display on the wall all the time. Hence the cloud in the shape of love will be the best idea. Unfortunately, I have not yet developed the habit of recording during art creation. For the purpose of taking part in this contest, I created a short tutorial for the techniques of creating the art entry. All the tools and techniques shown in the tutorial process is totally same as the original work, the only difference is the tutorial was created on A4 size paper. 此作品花了三天才完成。用的是丙烯颜料在三幅各为36x24寸的画布上，也是我所创作过最大的画。 我将会用这幅作品参加由@helene举办的，以云为主题的绘画比赛。云无常，时刻都在变幻，不可预测，不能定型。任何人都可以随便创作云的形状，因为云本来就是没有既定的形态。 这幅作品其实早在几个月前就已经完成，当时是作为贺礼送个我新婚的大哥。我不想传统的包个红包以示祝福就了事。想要画幅画送给大哥大嫂，又不想把新婚的主题太过突出，以免沦为只适合摆放一时的装饰品。这个以天空和云为骨架的双心交缠就很不错。就算是新婚之后，平常摆在墙上也不会奇怪。 可惜的是，创作的当下还没加入Steemit，也不知道记录创作过程的重要性。由于比赛都需要有详细的过程描述，我特意用同样的技术和工具创造了一个教程，详细的解释创作的过程。唯一所不同者只是参赛作品是在画布上，教程则是在A4纸上。 Tutorial of Cloud painting on paper 云的绘画教程Bigger brush for background painting, the smaller one is for the cloud. 较大的画笔负责背景，较小的则是画云。 Only 3 acrylics colors will be used, the blue for sky, white for cloud and black for cloud toning. 丙烯颜料，只有蓝白黑三色会被用到。分别为蓝天，白云，还有云的黑影。 Start off with the blue sky background. You can dilute the acrylics if you are working on thinner material like paper instead of canvas. 先从背景开始，也就是天空。在纸上作画时你可能要加点水把颜料调稀，在较为强韧的画布上则不用。 .gif)Some dilution help smoothens the color spreading. 加水后让大面积的彩绘更顺畅。 .gif)Spread evenly the colors. You want to be consistent on any background painting. 平均的为背景上色，平均的色调是关键。 Ready for the cloud painting. The blue color pigment was nicely finished. Wait for this layer to completely dried, you can use a hair dryer to speed up the drying. 等背景都干透了才准备进行云的部分。可以用吹风筒加速吹干。 .gif)We need the white pigment as thick as possible, so no dilution needed here. 白色颜料就不需要调稀了，越厚越好。 .gif)Start drawing a base sketch on the dry background. 为云的面积打下基础。 .gif)Things won’t be looking good as the first white layer is not thick enough to completely cover the blue background. Keep on painting base layer for the cloud. 现阶段不会太好看，因为白色的厚度不足以掩盖深蓝色的背景。现在只需要把云的骨架大概的绘出来。 The base layer of cloud is now done. 云的基础面已经完成。 .gif)Start toning the shadow part of the cloud, no dilution is needed too. 开始为云的暗影下笔，这里也不需要调稀。 Now the cloud is more lively and 3D with the compliment of different tones of shadow. 有了不同程度的暗影，云看起来更立体了一些。 .gif)Adding some cloud fragments to make it looks more natural. This can outline the dynamic character of cloud too. 加些小碎云会让整体看起来更真实，也会让人由云在移动中的感觉。 .gif)No cloud should have sharp edges, blur up the edge to make it more realistic. You can use a finer brush for this part. 云的边缘永远不会是尖锐分明的，将之模糊化会看起来更真实。这里可以使用更加细小的画笔。 Done for the tutorial, this cost me about 30 mins. 30分钟后，教程完成了。 The actual entry 参赛作品 The only in-the-progress photo in the small rented room. Sorry for the messy bedsheet. 这是唯一的在作画时所拍摄的照片，请忽略凌乱的床单。 The leftmost piece of canvas, which was mainly the part I’ve shown in the tutorial. 最左边的画布，也是教程中所呈现最多的。 The middle part of the whole picture. As you can see the blue sky has the biggest coverage here, that’s why when painting such a huge area, you need to prepare a large amount of pigment for the sake of consistency. Else the sky will have a different tone of color and looks unnatural. 中间的画幅。在这里可以看到天空蓝占了大面积，这也是为什么在绘画如此大型的画布时，一定要把背景颜色大量准备，否者很容易出现色调不一致的问题，作品效果会差很多。 The intersected loves represent my blessing for their marriage. Each of the 3 canvases is in the size of 36 inches tall and 24 inches wide. 最右边的画幅，也是双心交缠的主要篇幅。每幅画布都是36寸高24寸阔。 The creator having fun with the art while waiting for the for the arrival of the bride. 画家本人在等待新娘的到来时，和作品合影中。手中的道具是亲友团准备的。 Attached my Steemit ID on a A4 paper. 附上ID。 This entry is now hanging on the wall of the living hall. Though that was not easy for such a huge art creation, the satisfaction of completing a challenge always make it worthwhile. If you like the content, you know what to do. Peace! 这幅画如今正悬挂在饭厅的墙上。如此的大型绘画从来就不是简单的事情，所以完成之后的成就感也很大。希望你会喜欢！ Update/更新：The organiser has disaproved my original entry because I failed to provide the process photos of creating it, and I respect that decision.

Gordon Hayward from the Celtics had literally broken his leg after an attempt to catch a pass in the air. I did not include the actual injury part for that is a gory scene, you can google it if interested. On the other hand, Jeremy Lin has torn his ACL after landing from a layup. From the 5 second gif you can tell how he broke down after realizing his injured knee could erase all the effort he has put in during the offseason. Glorious career of the athletes is enviable for the ordinary people like us. Multi-millions contracts, endless endorsement for the famous brand and huge social influence. But many did not expect the glories can be destroyed by just an unbalanced landing. Ordinary occupations like waiters, engineers and doctors do not have to face the huge risk of sports injuries. If I were given the options, I’ll go for the star player too, haha. NBA 开打短短数天，已经有两位明星球员相续受重伤，赛季才开始就已经结束。 戈登．海沃德 Gordon Hayward第一场Celtics对阵Cavaliers开场不到五分钟，刚交易来的Gordon Hayward在一次空接的过程中高高跃起，对方两个球员识破了，一个紧紧跟在身后，一个挡在身前，因为身体对抗在空中的Hayward失去平衡，落地时左脚先至，然后站立不稳整个身子的重量都压上去。恐怖的一幕出现了，他的左脚踝以90度的诡异形态骨折了。（由于受伤画面惊悚，欲观看请自行搜索） Source 身边的球员们发现后，有的吓得抱头散开，有的背对着事发现场伫立，摇头喃喃自语，无不惊呆了。看到同为运动员的伙伴收到如此毁灭性的创伤，我想同理心的作用下这些球员所受到的震撼不是场边观众所能理解的。 林书豪 Jeremy Lin 也是在自家球队的揭幕战上，林书豪最后一节飞身上篮，落地后失去重心摔向场外，随即坐起来扶着右脚膝盖，意识到这次伤情严重，他转向队友连说“I’m done, I’m done.”，然后表情痛苦泪崩在地。事后官方也公布了伤情，确认为右膝髌韧带（ACL）断裂，林书豪将报销剩余的赛季。 虽然收的伤远不如Hayward的罕见和严重，但是ACL断裂也是足以毁灭一个球员的职业生涯，尤其林书豪的打法尤其依赖身体的机动性。从动图中可见，他受伤后一度无法置信的表情看着膝盖，意识到可能以后都无法像从前那般打球，那种绝望带来的崩溃远远大过疼痛，才是泪崩的原因，这家伙是有多爱打篮球！短短五秒钟的表情变化，足以说明球员的执着态度，足以牵动人心。 运动伤害是运动员们的天敌，在揭幕战上就遭受如此严重的伤病是更让人难以接受的。球员们在为其三个月的夏季休战期，为了提升技术不知在场上留了多少汗水，见证了多少个凌晨四点钟的早晨，就是为了在新赛季大展拳脚。然而这一切只需要一个落地不慎或是身体对抗就可以画上句号。 值得嘉许的是，赛后敌我双方球迷都在网上为受伤的球员祈福。生活大于篮球，是每个爱球之人都应该拥有的生活态度。观看自己支持的球队比赛，遇到顽强的对手，我更希望他们可以用更强大的战术和表现拿下比赛。要是对方有什么关键球员受伤退场，自家得到的胜利也不怎么值得庆贺了。胶着激烈的比赛过程才是看球观众的最大享受，伤病请你滚开吧！ 运动员的生涯是如此的脆弱，一次严重的肢体伤病就足以报销赛季甚至毁灭职业生涯，这是很多羡慕他们轻松年入百万的人所没想过的。今年表现出众签下大合约，明年可能就打不了球了。 反观一般的职业，如服务员，工程师，教师，还是医生律师，扭伤了手脚至多休息一阵就可以再度回到岗位工作。由于没有激烈的运动，严重的运动伤害也几乎不可能出现，最多得了个滑鼠手还是脖子僵硬，毁灭性伤害的巨大风险完全感受不到。 没有百万合约，铺天盖地的广告收入，一呼百应的名人效应，明星球员的风光并不如我们想象般的稳固，平凡市民也是有些地方值得羡慕的。所以要是可以选， 我会选择做个明星球员，哈哈哈。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘NBA之运动伤害 NBA injuries’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/nba-nba-injuries/"},{"title":"那些曾经的兼职们 Part-time jobs I ever had","text":"When I was a kid my family wasn’t doing well financially, so I develop the habit of working part-time at a young age. I used to proudly regard myself as the king of o part-time when KT comes to working experience discussion. The first job when I was 12 years old was at the biscuit factory. We don’t know much about child labor back then. I have a really busy ‘career’ during high school time. The next job is car washing service which was located in the downstairs of my old house. They had a really good business, especially during the public holiday. Selling school shoe at a supermarket. Typical white canvas shoe which is the standard shoe for the students in Malaysia. Served as a banquet waiter at a 5 start hotel, the Equatorial. Those who can afford to have a ball here aren’t the normal boring civilians, I had a good time working there. Worked for my uncle at his furniture factory. My uncle is close with my family hence we were treated like his own kid, fetching us back and forth from work and provided meals for us during break time. After high school graduation, did the salesperson role for Ogawa massage chair. The products were too expensive and I don’t acquired good selling technique hence those 2 months weren’t much enjoyable. Selling fruits at the night market for 2 weeks. I and my friend were so embarrassed to be recognized by the friends because we will be working in the market nearby our neighborhood. Working at the construction site was the most physically taxing job I ever had. This only lasted for one day and I remember I slept like a baby that night at 8 pm right after the hard day. The most interesting job was working as a croupier at the Casino. I was mainly conducting the Roulette table game which was much hard than conducting the poker games. The odds were complicated and we have to do the mental calculation, no calculator was allowed. Croupier has a nice pay too. I should write more about this next time. Selling handphones, promoting Jacuzzis, food and beverage sampling at the malls and so on. Some of my peers not even worked for a part-time before they get their real job after the college. Maybe they don’t have to, maybe they were too lazy for that. Working for part-time job as a teenager student wasn’t an easy path but I kind of miss those days when I look back though. 从小家境不好，自小就有兼职打工的习惯。尤其是为期数个礼拜连续假期，许多孩子都去寻找乐子的时候，我和几个志同道合的小玩伴都会提前就准备寻找工作。想起那段日子，其实也不以为苦。在那个物资贫乏的年代，也还不流行什么兴趣班之类的，要是不出外打工还真的不知道日子要如何度过。何况打工赚钱，开学后也可以有闲钱花，何乐而不为。 记得学生时期也颇以兼职经验丰富而自豪，常向友人吹嘘自己是兼职皇帝。大学毕业后才正式有了第一份工作，摆脱了兼职皇帝的身份。现在来数数兼职过的工作有哪些。 小学毕业就找了第一份兼职，当年应该是十二岁吧，还是个非法童工，当初人们对童工的概念没那么重。那是一份在饼干工厂的差事。还记得那里的卫生条件非常不堪，以至以后都对那类型的饼干抱有点阴影。这份工作维持两三个月，然后就升上中学了。忘了当初的工资是一天马币12元还是20元，总之就是非常狗血，但当初可是开心得很了。 中学初期，在自家楼下的洗车厂做兼职，断断续续做了有一两年吧。从洗车洒水到抹干上油样样都做，纯粹是体力活。每年的农历新年前夕是全年的高峰期，一天从早上九点到下午六点可以洗上整百俩的车，洗完了就回去冲个凉吃团圆饭去了。当时还和小伙伴们分析老板赚了多少钱，感觉这生意真有赚头。 中学时期十六岁左右，在超市卖过两个月的小白鞋，也就是俗称的校鞋。这间公司帮我开设了政府的公积金户口，所以我比同龄人更早就拥有公积金，当时提起还是挺得意的。 中学高中时期和哥们在一间五星酒店Equatorial做酒席侍者。一个小时马币四块钱吧，周末高点。这份工作也断断续续做了好几年。由于来到这类型酒店举办酒宴的人都有一点来路，这中间也挺多趣事发生的。试过最忙的时候，就是凌晨六时开工，晚上十二时收工，真正的是不见天日。 同时期也在伯伯的家私工厂打过工。工厂主要承包学校类的工程，即是各种木制的学生书桌，时而也有高官达贵的定制式家私。由于是老板是亲近的自家伯父，上下班都是由他载送，晚午餐也是伯母自煮的。现在他们年老力衰，也还没退休。所以有时候我暑假回去碰到他们出货的日子也会去帮帮忙。 中学毕业后，卖过两个月的Ogawa按摩椅。第一次做销售类的，因为主要都是主打价值马币八千的按摩椅，所以真的很不好卖，那两个月我只零零碎碎卖了一些周边，让我对销售失去了信心，觉得自己没有这方面的天赋。 上大学前，在夜市摆档口卖水果，也是粗重的工作，体力差一点可做不来。当时因为会去家里附近的夜市开档，还怕给熟人认出而难为情。做了两个礼拜撑不住了。在水果厂见识过如山的各类水果，还处理过很多腐烂的木瓜蜜瓜，那浓郁的味道导致后期对这些水果有些阴影。 在工地做建筑工是我试过最粗重的活，好像做了一天就倒下了。当初身材瘦小，抱着做这种体力活可以锻炼身体又可以赚钱的心态，跟着堂哥去工地报到了。用水桶杠调好了的水泥，用人手制作的山寨梯子爬上天花板拉电线，徒手用铁锤凿子在墙上打出电路开关的位置。记得当晚回到家八九点就睡着了，还睡得很香。 大学时期，在赌场做了两三年的荷官。这是迄今为止最有趣的工作了。我的主要游戏是负责轮盘，轮盘比起其他扑克类的游戏难度高很多。赔率更复杂而且全靠心算，还有在轮盘里打珠子也需要纯熟的手活。报酬而言也是所有兼职里最好的。可惜到后来我就被赌场拉入黑名单了。下次应该好好分享关于做荷官的趣事。 还有各种卖手机，卖按摩浴缸，试吃部门等等。越说越多了，有机会下次再选些有趣的来说吧。 从小到现在已经做过十几份不同类型的兼职，有些朋友则到出社会之前一份兼职都没做过。他们自有优越的家庭背景，或是自身也不想那么劳累。起码对我而言，这些经历是宝贵和值得回味的。 Images from pixabay This page is synchronized from the post: ‘那些曾经的兼职们 Part-time jobs I ever had’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/part-time-jobs-i-ever-had/"},{"title":"半身不遂的你，活得下去吗？Are you able to make a living as a disabled?","text":"I’ve seen much disabled who live their life on a wheelchair.

Trading in the cryptocurrency I’m picking up this skill starting from the June and so far it is profitable. Though I doubt most of the income were due to the rise of Bitcoin price. Trading online requires only a computer and internet access makes it the best option to work from home and of course, if you are good, create a generous amount of income. Online business Dropshipping is something I’m really interested these days. You don’t have to order a bunch of stock first to sell it online. Instead, you advertise for the supplier and forward them the orders, they will ship whatever base on the order directly to the clients. Though this is not new and the competition is somehow tight, choose the right niche and practice good strategy will grant you a better chance of success. Or you can join the Amazon FBA Private Label program to use their platform to sell your product. All you have to do is to send them the stock and they will do the rest for you from shipping to customer service. Art I could make use of my art skill to earn a living too. The most practical way will be teaching in a drawing class. Considering I can no longer move at my will easily, I can even choose to host the class at my house or somewhere nearby my place. Worse come to worse I can still perform street art, but it could be challenging for a disabled to carry a bunch of tools. Those aforementioned are the way I could think of to continue my survival if I’m disabled. What is yours? 平时在外通勤时见过不少残障人士，坐着轮椅上下公交车。虽然多为年老力衰的老人，其中也不乏正当壮年的年轻人。新加坡的残障公共设施做得挺完善的，虽然帮不上什么忙，也尽量不为他们制造麻烦。 有时也想，他们如何寻找生计？除了政府福利团体和家人的资助外，他们有没有办法自己赚口饭吃？在职场中，或许是我见识少，似乎没见过有人能坐在轮椅上谋得一职。老人家就罢了，那些年轻人了还有很长的路要走。 自由行走对大多数人是自然的，但不是必然的。中学时期有个球友，彼此不大熟但是挺互相欣赏对方的球技。不久在他升学之际，从面子书听到有件惨事发生了在他的身上。那天他和女朋友共同乘搭长途巴士回家，在高速公路上巴士出车祸了，记得还造成了相当的人命伤亡。事发时球友用身体掩护了身旁的女友，女友毫发无伤，球友却脊椎受损下半身不遂了。半年后女方应该是承受不住压力和球友分开了，这些都是从报章上和朋友那边听回来的。虽然没有再联络，从朋友圈上可以看到他依然离不开轮椅，庆幸的是生活态度挺积极向上，还交了新女友，还是很不错的。 只是想起曾经活蹦乱跳的小伙子一夜之间就必须在轮椅上生活，还是有点不胜唏嘘。不禁想，要是有天醒来就半身不遂，需要依靠轮椅度过余生，有什么本事能够让我不出外求职的同时继续生存下去？ 线上市场交易在家进行网上交易是个不错的注意。交易本身只需要电脑和网际网络就可进行，前提是真的要有获利才可以帮补生计。近来加密货币市场交易已经慢慢上手，地域性搬砖也是这一阵子的主要外快来源，不断的开发新市场会有更大的收益潜力。但是很多的收益都是来自于几个月来比特币的价格暴升，我市场交易操作的水平相信体现不多，需要多多努力。 线上买卖这是我最近开始向琢磨的方向，无商品的线上商店，就是个Dropshipping的概念。锁定某个市场，找好供应商，然后在网上卖相关商品，顾客下单后把单转给供应商，而供应商就直接把货寄给顾客。整个过程无需碰到实际商品，虽然这个早已不是什么新鲜idea，竞争也不小，但相信有心执行还是可行的。Amazon FBA Private Label program也是不错的方案，即是你找了一批货寄去Amazon，利用他们的平台做美国人的生意。从销售，客服，到售后都是由他们负责，你只需要提供货源。目前这是我最有兴趣的路子，就快实行。 绘画我还过得去的绘画技术，怎么说都可以去开个儿童绘画班，赚个补习费。考虑到行动不便，可以在家附近找个地方开课，或是索性在家开办绘画中心也可。再不济也可以去街头描画人像，但是这个有点没有保障，而且坐着轮椅还要携带各种道具很不方便。有空之余也还可以画些时下流行的文化当作周边卖。虽然没在艺术这条路上赚过一分钱，但混个两餐应该还是可以的。 以上都是对我而言，适合在家即可创造盈利的方式，你又有什么妙招呢？ Image from pixabay This page is synchronized from the post: ‘半身不遂的你，活得下去吗？Are you able to make a living as a disabled?’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/are-you-able-to-make-a-living-as-a-disabled/"},{"title":"勿忘初心才可以走得更远 Stay true to what you have started","text":"Most of the whales in the CN community were delegated by @ned and today the owner decided to take back the delegated SP (at least 2 million) without reasons.

Do not forget the original initiative why you start the Steemit journey and you may walk further. 今早看到了中文区各路大鲸鱼的代理SP统统被收回了，心里惘然若失。第一个就是想到以后文章可不会像从前般多钱了，还值得继续写下去吗？然后不禁心里一惊，哑然失笑。这不是刚开始在这里写作时想清楚了的吗。 在《Dont write a lot, write often》一文中，早已知道收入不该是写作的唯一价值。该文章的收入还是$0.09而已，如果那么低的收入都撑过来了，以后还会成问题么？ 刚开始以英文写作的的我，发现了中文区这块天地。这氛围很好，有数条大鱼秉着扶持新人的原则为他们点赞。看着文章收入的数字暴增，是对小鱼们最直接暴力的鼓励。在此特别感谢@tumutanzi @htliao身为代理大鲸期间对我的支持。 常言道由俭入奢易，由奢入俭难。未来文章的收入大缩水既然是可预期的，可想而知有些人也会放缓对Steemit的热情，甚至退出。其实这也未尝不好。市场上有一句话特别适合形容现在的情况: Good money drives out bad money 就是在某个市场中，更有价值的永远会淘汰弱者。好比早期的比特币爆发时期，在高峰的价格往往因为一些负面的流言蜚语就会导致价格暴跌。离开市场的绝大部份资金可以理解为投机炒作者，bad money。真正的价值投资者会留下来的，低价买入更多的资产，也形成了价格底线的维护者。以后价值开始体现在价格上时，收获也就更大了。 这道理在Steemit中文区同样适用。没有了大鱼们的点赞加持，有多少人还能坚持下去？勿忘初心，才能走得更远。 Image from pixabay This page is synchronized from the post: ‘勿忘初心才可以走得更远 Stay true to what you have started’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/stay-true-to-what-you-have-started/"},{"title":"Is day trading positively impact the society 市场交易行为为社会创造了什么价值","text":"I started trading cryptocurrency 4 months and was lucky enough to be profitable so far, and it felt just awesome.

No matter how fancy the strategies or formulas sounds, they buy low and sell high. For instance, I buy 1 Bitcoin at $5000, the next second it rise to $5010 and I sell it. Boom, I made $10 out of the thin air! Except for me and the exchange, did I make anyone happier or better by doing this? I did not. Some economists might say trading is beneficial to the economy by throwing abstruse terminologies at me. But sorry, I can’t see how making money by some random clicks in front of a computer can benefits anything, except my pocket. As such, I regard trading has zero productivity compared to all the other stuff I’ve been through to earn money. It was kind of a complicated feeling. I’m glad that making money can be this easy at the same time feeling lost as I’m not adding value to the world. But surely I do feel great overall if I can be a successful trader. There are many ways to make someone feel great about themselves too. The most obvious one will be a donation. So stop worrying not being constructive, you can do achieve anything when you have a deep pocket! 四个月前接触了加密货币，就开始了市场交易的道路，而且很幸运的这段日子都是赚钱的。打从十二岁开始，我就做过各式各样的工作。赚钱对我来说，从来就是和出卖劳力划上等号的。但是我仍然记得第一次再市场中交易赚钱的感觉，是那么的激动人心和不可置信。 这也让我想了很多，市场交易实在是最棒的工作之一。不需要天天挤地铁去上班，没有上头需要汇报。不用租个厂库来囤货，也不用买卖货物，更不用面对烦人的客户。给我一台电脑和wifi，就可以起飞。这还不是最好的赚钱途径？当然，前提是必须稳定的可以从险恶的市场中脱颖而出。很难，但并非不可能。 世上所有的工作都会创造价值，工作的成果会为社会带来影响。厕所清洁工付出汗水创造了舒适干净的如厕环境，上市公司的CEO燃烧脑细胞为公司谋取更高的营收。每个人都在赚钱的过程中为某些东西添加了价值，为社会进步作出了贡献。但是交易员（trader）是例外。 交易员如何赚钱的？不管他们使用的策略还是方程式有多么的酷炫深奥，始终都离不开一个原则，买低卖高。以比特币为例，我在$5000时买进，下一秒$5010时卖出，一眨眼间就赚了十块钱。没有货物买卖，没有价格谈判，我就已经比一秒前的我富有了10块钱！除了我的口袋和交易平台，还有谁在这过程中受益？答案是没有。 可能这里某些经济学家就会跳出来说其实交易行为会为社会经济带来正面影响，然后抛出一堆艰深难懂的术语理论。原谅我的才疏学浅，还是看不出在电脑前用滑鼠按两下这样的赚钱行为有直接让谁得到好处了。所以市场交易这种行为在跟其他我所做过的工作中，是最没有社会生产率的。 这是一种很复杂的感觉。赚钱原来可以这么简单这回事让我欣喜不已，但意识到这不是什么富有价值的行为却也让我有点迷失。当然如果幸运可以成为一个赚钱的交易者，开心绝对是居多的。 其实要自我感觉良好还是有很多方法的，最直接的就是捐款做善事。所以还是别忧心这钱赚得有没有价值了，赶紧加深口袋的厚度才是正道啊！ Image by pixabay This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Is day trading positively impact the society 市场交易行为为社会创造了什么价值’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/is-day-trading-positively-impact-the-society/"},{"title":"How do you do after graduation 混得好不好","text":"Just celebrated the 10 years anniversary of high school graduation this year. Looking back for what I’ve achieved since the day stepped out from the school gate. Took a Bachelor title, in a stable relationship with girlfriend, working on a 9-5 job, taking average wages. Life has been so dull to make me feel like I wasn’t doing good at all. Last week I had a late night gathering with old classmates and we had a great moment sharing our recent development. I have lost touch with most of the old friends from the same school, it was a good opportunity to catch up with their news. Friend A was addicted to gambling, spent most of his earning into soccer gambling. Won a little at first, lost all the way after. The worst part was he seek financial help from the loan shark. Soon after he lost the borrowed fund too, he asked for another loan shark to cover the previous debt. The snowball effect makes him ended up in a really bad debt situation. He owed a lot to his close friends too. Friend B is optimistic and won’t even care if his bank account often hovering below 4 digit number. This figure almost can represent a broke status given he already working for a few years. He was really into the fish fighting business and the peak time he got almost 50 small jars for his fishes in his room. Due to unknown reason, his fish business was closed and I don’t hear of him starting another business. Friend C having a relatively laid-back job although he always claimed to be very busy at work. We can often see him chilling in the cafes and his usual night activity is to spend the whole night chit-chatting and playing mobile games with the friends in the street vendors. His income is not high, if he can use his time wisely we would keep hearing complaints from him that the money is always lacking. Friend D still fighting for his boring Amway MLM dream. Friends around him already developed the habit to sneer at his typical motivational marketing quotes in social media. Friend E was the most miserable. He was so introvert that not many have talked much with him during school time. Only to find out he was gone for a sickness earlier this year. After all, I realized that I’m actually doing better than most of them. Image from Pixabay 岁月匆匆，中学毕业至今已有十个年头。回顾这段日子，生活上到底有什么斩获。拿了个学士头衔，有着一段稳定的感情，干着一份早九晚五的工作，领着不高不低刚好够用的薪水。一直觉得日子过得有点平淡，混得如我这般的水平其实也是有点不尽人意。 不久前在家乡和中学时期的三五好基友聚会。许久不见，大家高谈阔论天南地北至深夜，相聚甚欢。由于出国工作，许多旧时同窗已经好久没联系，至多在社交网络上偶有神交，不知不觉就和朋友聊起他们的近况。 同学A原来染上赌瘾，把打工赚来的钱都花在赌球上。过程也是老套的先尝到点甜头，然后就有去无回的一直输下去。最糟糕的是他还向高利贷借钱来赌，输了再借其他的高利贷来还钱。这样反复操作终于让他欠下了好几组的高利贷债务，听说身边和他相熟的朋友也有不少结果他钱的。听说后来终于肯乖乖安分的打份工来还债了。 同学B天性豁达乐观。毕业后喜欢上了斗鱼，这种鱼俗称打架鱼。身躯娇小，生性好斗，把两只同时放在同一个容器里不久后就会看到它们都个天翻地覆，至死方休。所以也有所谓的斗鱼运动，就是比谁的鱼才是打架王。这种鱼还有一个特色，就是品类众多，从平平无奇到色彩鲜艳的鳞色，简直目不暇给。这样的特性也促成了斗鱼的选美比赛，比谁的鱼更华丽出色。同学B巅峰时期家里收藏了多达四五十条的斗鱼，满满的整个房间都是大大小小的容器，还时常飞去泰国入货，做起斗鱼买卖，隐隐有借此维生之势。 后来不知是因为经营不善还是什么就不干了，听说他偶尔有提起银行户口经常都是徘徊在四位数之间，神色间也满不以为意。这对一个在社会工作了五六年的人来说几乎是破产级别的。 同学C干着一份挺悠闲的差事，虽然嘴上常说自己有多么的忙不过来。却总是能够在各大咖啡厅和路边摊看到他的身影，也常常无所事事和朋友在摊子聊天打手游，从晚上一直到凌晨。他收入也不高，却把日子过得如此不上进。和他说过要是把这份闲情花在有用的地方上，就不用整天和我们埋怨钱不够用了。 同学D搞安利传销搞了好几年，业务也不见起色。反而在看到他朋友圈依旧积极推销产品时，我们已经养成调侃他的习惯了。 同学E更惨，中学时期已经时绝世孤僻了，和他说过两句话的人也没几个，近来居然听说他因病去世了。 忽然发现，自己原来混得已经很好了。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘How do you do after graduation 混得好不好’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/how-do-you-do-after-graduation/"},{"title":"How to preserver graphite drawing 如何保存铅笔画","text":"After spending hours of effort onto that awesome pencil artwork, the last thing you would do is just close the sketchbook up, only to find out it was all smudged up next time you open it. The fixative spray is specially designed for protecting graphite, charcoal, pencil, pastel, and chalk from dusting, smudging and fading. They can also provide UV protection without dissolving whites and lights. Many big art brands provide their fixative spray and I got the Krylon Fine Art Fixatif for S$19 from local art supplies store. There is 2 kind of fixative spray, the workable fixative, and the final fixative. Workable fixative saves the progress of work and further touch up can still be added on to the medium. When everything is done, the artwork may seal up with the final fixative. Krylon Fine Art Fixatif is somewhat in between, as it provides workable and final protection. Apply a thin layer for the workable layer and a few layers consecutively for the final varnishing result. 最不想看见的事辛苦创作的铅笔画在画完之后，因为没有妥善保存，下次再看时已经模糊不清了。保护喷胶就可以完美解决这问题，还可以防紫外线。我在本地的画具店卖了Krylon Fine Art Fixatif，价格是新币19元。这支有点特别，喷一层薄的就可以锁住目前的进度，还可以继续在上面加工。如果完工了要完全封锁效果，就连续喷上数层即可。 I will varnish my Eagle which was a contest entry weeks ago using the fixative spray. Mark any area that you don’t want to spray, in my case I want to spray the whole figure. 我会用用数个礼拜前的参赛作品《老鹰》来示范。先将不要被喷到的地方掩盖起来，我则要覆盖整个图像。 Shake the spray every time before using it. 使用之前先摇匀。 .gif) Test spray in an inconspicuous area for compatibility. 在通风的地方试喷几下以确保正常运作。 .gif) Spray artwork in the upright position. Begin at closest edge and stroke from left to right across the surface and beyond the edge. Overlapping slightly for every stroke. Since the work is already done and no more tuning is needed, I will apply a few layer to achieve the final fixative result. 将作品垂直摆放。由左至右一道一道的喷，每道之间稍微互相覆盖以确保每寸图像都有被照顾到。因为这已经是完成的作品，我将直接喷上数层将之完全封锁起来。 .gif) The coat will dry in 15 minutes.

Pencil on A4 size cardboard. This is an entry for a drawing contest by @helene with the theme Light. Light enables us to see what we see. Actually, we can just draw anything for fitting into the light themed contest as it would a total darkness if no light was present. But obviously, that wasn’t the intention of the organizer. Two Glasses 两只酒杯 I have to find something that can represent the light in our everyday life. The first thing that came to my mind was the glass cup. The glass has the ability to capture light motion as it moves, complimented by various blurred shadow. However, that would be a repetition since I have drawn the beer cup for 2 weeks ago for the same contest series too. I got to find something else that is able to show the presence of light in an interesting way. The subject I chose for the contest is the dewdrop on a leave. I always love the look of dewy leaves. Early in the morning, the dewdrop silently sitting on a leave, facing towards the sunlight. The naturally perfect circle shape was crystal clear. Combined with the refractions of outside world, showing a tremendous detail of morning light. 此作品花了近两个小时，用的是铅笔画在卡片上。 我将会用这幅作品参加由@helene举办的，以光为主题的绘画比赛。光是我们能看见事物的最重要元素，几乎任何东西都可以参加以光为主题的比赛。因为没有光就看不见任何东西，没有光暗表现，将是一片漆黑。但那应该不是主办方的本意。 现实生活中有很多东西可以呈现光线，第一个想到的就是玻璃杯子。玻璃杯子有很好的透光性，还可以因为造型的不同把光用各种匪夷所思的角度弯曲，让平平无奇的光线呈现千变万化的舞姿。但在之前的比赛已经画过同类型的两只酒杯了。不想画重复的东西，只好再继续寻找适合的主题。 如上所见，这次选择的主角是露珠。露珠是很可爱的存在，每个凌晨霞光初露寒气未散之时，花园中的叶子上总会有点点晶莹剔透的露珠。它们静静的坐在叶子上，完美圆形的透明身躯被阳光透过，配合外界的事物，在小小露珠的世界里呈现了光怪陆离的光线。 Breakdown of drawing I wanted to draw on a toned surface to showcase the white strokes of light. But all I have is the pure white paper sketchbook. Why not trying to draw on the cardboard cover of the sketchbook itself? The surface was rough but it should be fine. 因为手上只有纯白的画纸，为了呈现白色的光线只好使用绘画本的棕色卡片封面。表面是粗糙了些，但是无碍下笔。 Sketch the outline of the dewdrop shape and the base of leaves. 先把草稿画出来，主要是露珠的原型和叶子底线。 Drawing the detail of shadow first with a pencil, you don’t want to go hard on the stroke now. 把露珠的阴影用浅手法画出来。 Extend the shadowing on the leave, now heavier stroke can be used as we almost got the whole frame steady. 初具格局之后，用稍微重的手法把暗影加深，也把露珠所带出来的影子呈现在叶子上。 Now comes the exciting part. This is my first time using white pencil, now you see the point of drawing on a toned material, else the whites can’t play a part in it to present more contrast against the shadow. 处理好暗影部分后，是时候试一下白色铅笔的效果了。现在在中色纸上作画的好处就会显现，白色比划很好的呈现露珠里的光线。 Whiten the reflective areas in the dewdrop, as well as the glowing shadow on the leave. The white pencil and gel pen work like charm covering up the graphite by pencil. 第一次使用的白色铅笔和原子笔出乎意料的好用，露珠和叶子的反光部分很立体的描述出来了。 Touching up the background with a few really rough blurred shade, added a few tiny dews too. Now it is the time to darken the shadow inside and around the dewdrops to make the contrast looks more real. Dewdrop did a great job to capture the shapeless light and present it lively under the close-up angle. If you like the content, you know what to do. Peace! 主体完成之后，可以把叶子的背景再加强点，利用模糊背景的手法把主体衬托得更突出。白笔的第一次使用效果很不错，露珠的透光效果令人满意。 在镜头放大之下的露珠果然是捕捉无形光线的好帮手。希望你会喜欢！ My other artworks: Cloud 云 Two glasses 两只酒杯 Steemit Hero · Steemit英雄 The Venom 超级毒液 Eagle 老鹰 Spiderman 蜘蛛人 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Drawing Challenge#9 Light 光’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/drawing-challenge-9-light/"},{"title":"Create footer for your post 为文章创造页脚","text":"Starting from the day I decided to heavily involved in Steemit, I spend most of my spare time reading, commenting and voting here. I try to start at least publishing a post every day too. There is one tip that I heard somewhere else and I think that is very effective in building the followers base, that you must build your personal brand in the society. Since Steemit is a blogging platform, we can try to create some consistency in our daily post. Some use an edited thumbnail photo by adding their face or logo on it, some draft the post title in a certain manner, or include a footer or signature logo at the end of the post. I think these are the good idea letting the audience know immediately whose article they are reading without looking at the author’s name. I always wanted to have a unique footer of my own. Today I will create one using Gimp and make use one of my drawing contest entry as material. 自从中了Steemit的毒之后，每天都花了大量的时间在这里看文章，点赞和留言。每天至少发一篇文章是我给自己的规定。 对于建立自己的关注群，之前听到一个觉得蛮有用的技巧。那就是必须建立个人品牌，让人家不用看作者名字就知道是你的作品。有些人在第一张图片上喜欢贴上自己的照片，有些人喜欢用特定风格的标题，有的则喜欢在文章尾部加上个性签名或是页脚。我想要创作属于自己的页脚很久了，今天就付诸行动吧。 使用的软件是 Gimp ，材料则是之前的参赛作品。以下的创作过程就不翻译了，太多专属名词，语法也很简单易懂。 Breakdown of footer creation First, open the image in Gimp. Change the image size to your liking. And right click on the current layer and select Add Alpha Channel. Use the Paths tool to outline the part of the image you want to crop out. After you have selected the part, from the menu bar, Select -&gt; Invert. This will make the invert the selection and select the unwanted background instead. Press [Backspace] key, the background is now removed. Add a new layer in order to enlarge the canvas size. Use the Scale Tool from the toolbox. Make sure current layer selection is the newly created layer. Then drag from right to left to the desired size. To fit the cropped image into the larger canvas size. Image -&gt; Fit Canvas to Layers. The combined image will now look like this. Add another white background and add text using Text Tool from the toolbox. We’re done here. Export the project into PNG format. File -&gt; Export As. This is a really simple footer creation guide using existing image. Maybe I should study how to create an animated image (gif) in the future. But for the moment, I’m satisfied with the footer result! 对于常使用此类修图软件的人来说，这可是小菜一碟，我就花了好几个小时来研究各种操作。总的来说，这是个非常简洁的页脚，效果也还可以，将就先用着吧，看以后有时间再学学动图创作。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Create footer for your post 为文章创造页脚’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/create-footer-for-your-post/"},{"title":"Powerful tool to reduce grammar mistakes 推介一款强大的英文寫作技巧强化利器","text":"I was first writing on Steemit in English, only to switch to bilingual for English and Chinese when I found out that the Chinese community is such a fun place to join.

This can be really motivational and appreciate the recognization. 今天我刚解封了 大力神 的成就，意味着已经连续写作了 12 个星期。挺有振奋人心的作用。 I will unlock the next achievement by the 16th week of writing which is next month. Of course I will be there! 下一个成就解封需要多四个星期，当然没问题了！ They will show you the productivity against the other users as well. They didn’t show the clear definition of productivity but supposedly they refer to the amount of writing you have done. 他们还会让你和其余的用户比较。第一个数据就是效率，应该是指文字总输出量。连续写了 12 个星期就干掉了96%的用户哦。 This is my weakest part, the grammar accuracy. My laziness to correct the simple mistake like dont to don’t contributes a lot to this stat too. 看来语法精准度是我的最大弱点。无可否认，有时明显的低级错误我也很懒得自己修改，交给他们自动修改则省事得多。但是也拉低了这一指标。 Quite surprised by this stat, I used more unique words than 97% of the users? Can’t believe that. 使用特殊词汇上我居然胜过了 97% 的用户？有点难以置信啊。 Top 3 mistakes I’ve made, seems like the comma problem troubles me a lot. 三种我最常犯的语法错误，看来放逗号方面有点问题。只是有时候我还是觉得自己没错的，就忽略不管了。 Clicked into their trophy page to see all the achievements you’ve unlocked. They use legendary characters to represent each level, funny. 这是官方的荣耀页面，可以看到自己目前为止所有的成就。很有趣味的用传说人物来表达每个等级，挺有创意的。 This tool is free to use and of course, there is paid version where they claimed to be able to detect more advanced grammar errors. Sure this whole report thingy was part of the strategy to subscribe their premium package but so far the freemium is suffice to me. Grammarly does provide a great help in reducing the awkwardness in publishing low-level grammar mistakes. Give it a try. 重点是这么有诚意的软件居然还是免费的，当然也有收费版本，据说可以指出更高级的语法错误。他们搞这些报告啊什么的噱头其实也是最后也一定会打广告让你加入收费服务。我觉得免费版本其实已经足够好，也很满意它的效率了。如果你还在为英语写作的语法错误而纠结不已，试一下 Grammarly 吧！ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Powerful tool to reduce grammar mistakes 推介一款强大的英文寫作技巧强化利器’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/powerful-tool-to-reduce-grammar-mistakes/"},{"title":"All you need to know about Steemit interface revamp【Steemit 改版需知】","text":"Steemit.com has revamped their website interface this morning.

According to the latest announcement by @steemitblog, we can conclude the following: 今早起来发现 Steemit 改头换面了，之前闹得沸沸扬扬的新 Logo 也华丽的登场了。第一个念头就是 “糟糕，上次才设计好的页脚里包含了旧的标识，难道不能再用了？”冷静点，根据 @steemitblog 的最新通告，我们知道： New Steemit logo is completely owned by Steemit Inc. 新的标识完全由 Steemit.Inc 私有Source The Steemit brand and logo are protected by intellectual property laws, including copyright and other proprietary rights of the United States and foreign countries. Steemit 品牌和标识为知识产权所保护，包括周边的一切专利都将在美国和世界各地生效。 This means that you can no longer make use of this new logo without their official authorization. You cannot print this logo on any T-shirt or accessories and sell them, or publicly display them for commercial use. I’m not sure about how far does the copyright cover but we should treat this logo just to represent the Steemit company only. 这意味着新标识不能被第三方所使用。人们不能在衣服或是周边产品印上 Steemit 新标识并售卖，或是在商业用途的角度公开展示此标识。公告里没有给出详细的例子，目前也不清楚专利的覆盖范围有多广。必须了解的是，Steemit 标识和 Steem 本身是没有冲突的，它只是代表了 Steemit.Inc 这间公司。 The Steem logo is still the same and free to use 原本的 Steem 标识没有改变并可以免费使用Source Steem logo is licensed under Creative Commons CC0 which means this logo can be freely used without permission. So I can keep using my newly-created footer which included the Steem logo and still is valid. Other Steem front-end website like cnsteem.com by @skenan and busy.org can still use the Steem logo as usual, though they can come up with an exclusive logo to their site and patent it. 代表 Steem 货币的标识没有变化。因为是登记在創作共用授權條款之下，此标识将不需批准就可以使用在任何地方，网上看见的各种衣服和装饰都是合法的。所以我之前依据 Steem 标识创造的页脚仍然可以使用，因为我想代表的是 Steem 区链块而不是 Steemit 这间公司。第三方网站如 busy.org 和 @skenan 的 cnsteem.com 仍然可以使用 Steem 标识，当然参考 Steemit 官方的做法这些第三经营方也大可设计自己的独有标识，并将之专利化以作为自己网站的独特门面。 New feature - Toggle Night Mode 新功能-夜间模式 I found this feature the only practical and useful feature in this update. Now the heavy users can tuck inside their bed scrolling Steemit without straining the eyes with the screen blue lights. And I found the turquoise color match the black theme very much, the contrast makes the wording and logo more outstanding than in the usual white background. 这是改版后我发现最为实用的功能。对那些喜欢睡前窝在被窝里刷 Steemit 的中毒用户可谓一大福音，眼睛终于可以少受罪了。个人而言，新版的綠松色因为属于亮色系，在白色背景下是有点难看清楚的。但是在夜间模式的黑背景的衬托下，看起来就很舒服了，这样的黑绿配色效果也是很不错的，看起来有点游戏风，页面年轻了很多。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘All you need to know about Steemit interface revamp【Steemit 改版需知】’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/all-you-need-to-know-about-steemit-interface-revamp-or-steemit/"},{"title":"Trezor could have been your worst enemy 最安全的钱包也可以是你最可怖的敌人","text":"Read an epic story of losing $30,000 in bitcoin by storing in a Trezor.

January 4, 2016: 7.4 BTC = $3,000 Nick bought 7.4 BTC with $3,000 after some research. Knowing he needs to secure the newly acquired asset, he ordered a Trezor and store all the BTC inside of it. He too wrote down the 24-word recovery seed on an orange paper. April 4, 2017: 7.4 BTC = $8,384 Came back from a holiday, Nick found out the orange paper is lost. Panicked. He put on the gloves and searched through the trash and garbage bin but to no avail. But it’s okay, Nick remembers the Trezor password correctly, 551445. April 5, 2017: 7.4 BTC = $8,325 Wrong pin. Nick tried a several similar passwords again and all were incorrect guesses. And the bad news is the Trezor will delay for the next PIN input after a fail attempt. And the delay doubled everytime a wrong PIN was entered. It will cost 34 years to enter the 31st guess. Customer service of Trezor couldn’t help without the PIN code and recovery seed, which both went missing for Nick. The forgotten PIN is haunting Nick days and nights. He went to the Reddit asking for help desperately. many ridiculed him and asked him to kiss the 7.4 BTC goodbye. May 25, 2017: 7.4 BTC = $12,861 After several heart-breaking guesses, Nick even approached hypnotist to recall the PIN. After a nearly four hours session, he decides the PIN was 5514455. Took him days to gather the nerve to try it. Wrong PIN. Nick now have to wait for four and a half hours until the next try. Having an unreachable treasure is torturing. That moment Nick realized this forgotten password will be the tinnitus for the rest of his life. August 16, 2017: 7.4 BTC = $32,390 Trezor manufacturer urged the users to update their firmware to the latest version. It is reported that the Trezor device could have been hacked using some physical tricks and expose the wallet private key. This is the best chance for Nick to take advantage of. August 24, 2017: 7.4 BTC = $32,387 With the help of Andreas M. Antonopoulos, the most well-known figure in bitcoin. Nick had a techie 15 years old kid, Saleem to help him hacking the device. The fee is 0.85 BTC which is $3,700 by the time, Nick had to take this deal. August 26, 2017: 7.4 BTC = $32,208 After practicing the hack on a new Trezor and by sheer luck, Nick finally hacked into his own device and gained access again to the precious 7.4 BTC. The safest vault has no mercy even to its owner without a proper backup. Nick’s 7.4 BTC should be long gone for good if it weren’t for: Trezor just happened to have a rare exploitable bug. He knew the right guy to hack the device for him He never set up passphrase (a special encryption feature) in his device. And what we can learn from this story: Your wallet might not always be your friend if you are not following instructions. Back-the-hell-up whatever your wallet ask you to backup 几天前看到一个很精彩的故事，一个在自己的 Trezor 钱包里弄丢三万美金的故事。Trezor 是号称世界上最安全的个人硬体钱包，这个故事里，它就是最可怖的敌人。前往这里阅读全文，文长慎入。 January 4, 2016: 7.4 BTC = $3,000 尼克花了三千美金买了 7.4 个比特币。听取所有人的建议后，买了 Trezor 代为保管。设定好密码之后，他也将至关重要的 24 字恢复种子抄在一张字条上。 打算在假期回来之后，搞个金属的专属密码条把恢复种子好好备份起来。 April 4, 2017: 7.4 BTC = $8,384 假期回来后，字条不见了。尼克有点紧张，把家里和外面的垃圾桶都找遍了还找不到。但是没关系，他还记得密码，551445。只要钱包还有在，有密码就可开启。 April 5, 2017: 7.4 BTC = $8,325 密码错误，Trezor 的小小显示屏上如此表示。再试多几次，还是错误。更糟糕的是，Trezor 再每一个失败的登入后会加个时间，倒数完才可开始下次的密码输入，这时间每失败一次都会双倍的增加。拉出计算机简单一算，第三十一次的尝试足足需要等上三十四年。尼克开始慌了。 Trezor 的客服表示如果没有密码和恢复种子，他们也爱莫能助。官方渠道算是断了。 日月饱受煎熬的尼克上了 Reddit 的专区求救，换来的只是无尽的嘲讽，还有人叫他给这 7.4 个比特币一个吻别，然后将之忘记好好生活。 May 25, 2017: 7.4 BTC = $12,861 再经过几次令人心碎的尝试后，Trezor 再度可以输入密码的时间已经来到数个小时。尼克决定找个催眠师来唤回失去的记忆。经过四个小时的催眠后，他确定了密码就是 5514455 ，然后花了几天才鼓起勇气再试一次。密码错误。下次可输入密码的倒计时变成了四个半小时。 明明坐拥宝藏却触摸不到。这个时候尼克终于意识到，忘记密码这回事如果不完美解决，将会是他一辈子的梦魇。 August 16, 2017: 7.4 BTC = $32,390 Trezor 官方全面通知用户必须将自己的设备升级上最新的固件。原因是现有的版本有个致命的漏洞，要是设备落入黑客的手上，就有可能被物理手段破解 Trezor 钱包然后偷走一切。这对尼克来说是个绝佳的机会。 August 24, 2017: 7.4 BTC = $32,387 在比特界大名鼎鼎的 Andreas M. Antonopoulos 介绍之下，尼克认识了十五岁来自英国的黑客小能手。小黑客提出 0.85 BTC 的价码来帮助尼克破解他的设备，换成美金就是将近四千刀，虽然价格不菲，但尼克别无他选了。 August 26, 2017: 7.4 BTC = $32,208 在诸神庇佑之下，和用新的钱包试验一次之后，尼克终于成功的破解了自己的 Trezor 钱包，7.4 BTC 再次和他见面了。 如果不按指示备份的话，你的钱包并不会因为你是主人而网开一面。尼克的比特币要不是以下种种因素全部凑在一起，早就完蛋了： Trezor 那么碰巧的出现了极度罕有的固件漏洞。 他刚巧有管道认识到能帮助他的人。 他没有设定 Passphrase（Trezor 特有的加密功能） 在设备上。 读过这故事，我们学到： 最安全的钱包也会是你最大的敌人，如果你不听话好好备份。 如果你的钱包要求你再怎么麻烦的备份，你他x的全照着做就对了。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Trezor could have been your worst enemy 最安全的钱包也可以是你最可怖的敌人’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/trezor-could-have-been-your-worst-enemy/"},{"title":"Are you still waiting for a crash 比特币的最佳入场时机","text":"I was the first amongst my friends to invest in cryptocurrency, it all started from a shady money game from May 2017.

August 09, 2017: BTC = $3261 As my confidence level going up with the price, I started to persuade friends to look into this innovative blockchain technology, perhaps they can invest in a small amount using the spare money.

They insisted on waiting. November 03, 2017: BTC = $7277 We’re hitting all-time high again within a week.

Sensei is a Japanese honorific term that is literally meant as the person born before another. This can be translated as a teacher or a master too. Master Roshi from the Dragon Ball is the first Sensei to Goku. His most destructive skill is the Kamehameha which he taught to Goku later. He is the most humane role in the comics too for being a good teacher, righteous hero at some crucial moments. He too has some weaknesses like his lust for women, sometimes taking petty advantages of others. Overall, he is the first one came to my mind for the Sensei theme. 这幅作品花了三十分钟来完成，主要用的是墨笔在 A4 纸上。 此作品将会用来参加 @sirsensei 所举办以 Sensei 为主题的绘画比赛。 Sensei 是日本字，在中文同意同音先生。通常有着老师，师傅和达人等意思。 来自七龙珠的龟仙人是第一个出现在脑里 Sensei 代表。他是悟空在书里的第一个师傅，传授了他最厉害的招式，龟波气功。龟仙人也是一个很人性化的角色。作为一个师傅，他正义，识大体，在危急关头懂得挺身而出。当然他也有不少弱点，平时有点贪生怕死，还非常好女色，懂不懂看到美女就流鼻血，非常搞笑。 Breakdown of drawing Rough sketch using pencil. 用铅笔浅浅的草稿。 Outline the character using an ink pen, starting from the head first. 然后用墨笔把线条画出来，先从头部开始。 Continue to the body. 在接下来到身体部分。 Erase those pencil sketch after the complete outline is done using an ink pen. 完成墨笔划线部分后，把铅笔草稿擦去。 Using a pencil to tone the shape of shadow, no smudging is needed.

Clear sky with a calm big lake is going to be a great material for the sketching. This is a fishing zone too, you can see people fishing with various tools and some of them were skillful enough to harvest generous amount of fishes. 蓝天白云，加上绿草和湖泊，Perfect！这里同时是合法的钓鱼区，可以看见不少发烧友在这里垂钓。有者似乎功夫到家，收获颇丰。写生之余抬头看看身边人们的动静，也挺有趣的。 Finally I got the chance to pose this legendary move that I learned from the TV or comics when the artist start to sketch the scenery.

But I still regularly visit YouTube for there are still some interesting channels that I cannot live without. For example the NBA and Vox channel. These are the big brands and won’t be easy to land their foot in a new place like Steemit. However, I also subscribed an interesting yet educational personal channel, namely Marcello Barenghi. Marcello Barenghi is an Italian artist who also known as “the best artist in the world” by most of his fans. By using tools like airbrush, acrylics, pencil, markers and much more, he can recreate a hyper-realistic art on a paper or canvas. Let’s enjoy some of his masterpieces. All images and video are taken from the artist personal site: http://www.marcellobarenghi.com/, feel free to pay him a visit. I thought that would be a great idea to introduce Steemit to Mr. Marcello Barenghi. If he ever agrees to give it a try, there are a couple of advantages for us all: I can enjoy his art creating process right here on Steemit. I can pay my respect by upvoting so that he can earn real money while the YouTube’s like gives him nothing at all. He can broaden his fan base here He can earn direct reward without advertisement and commissions. No extra work for him as he already shares the same things anyway on the other social sites. All I did was just sending him an email with the content below. I briefly explain how Steemit can benefit his artist career at the same time use my artwork’s reward for example. Email contentHi Mr. Marcello Barenghi, I’m a fan of your realistic art for a long while since I discovered your YouTube channel. You have a huge fanbase, millions of YouTube subscription and now running a crowdfunding event on Patreon. Since you are making a living by creating art, I hereby introduce you the Steemit. Steemit is an awesome platform for publishing your amazing artworks and instantly get rewarded. You can profit directly through follower‘s vote and no one is in between you and your fans to draw commission like what YouTube does. You can google it or have a quick read on the links below to understand how this platform works: https://steemit.com/steemit/@mindover/steemit-for-dummies-like-me-everything-you-need-know-to-get-started Steem official bluepaper: https://steem.io/steem-bluepaper.pdf For better illustration, I joined Steemit since July 2017 and has been earning up to $500 to date. I created art and shared it on the platform too. $4.57 for a 30-minute artwork with pencil and ink pen. You can see the actual post here. My largest project with 49 votes and $23.94. You can see the actual post here. This is by far my highest voted post for a total $99.64. You can see the actual post here. All you have to do is to share your upcoming or previous works on Steemit and promote it like what you did on YouTube. Please ask me if you have any inquiries and I shall be honored to assist you. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Cheers,fr3eze I will start approaching my favorite channels or blog authors using personal contact like this. Though this is way less efficient than what @jerrybanfield does in advertising Steemit in large scale as his witness service, I find a way to add value to this amazing society too. Hope I can score one success or two by doing so, it is going to be a win-win. Steemit 已经成了我花时间最多的网站之一，抛弃脸书对我来说还是轻而易举的，因为很早之前就发觉这类社交软件最是浪费时间而不带来任何好处。但很多时候还是会上别的网站来关注有趣的信息，因为在 Steemit 里找不到。其中之一就是 YouTube 里大名鼎鼎的 Marcello Barenghi. Marcello Barenghi 是位意大利籍艺术家，粉丝们都称他为世上最好的画家。在 YouTube 上有过百万的订阅量。他主要的作品风格是高度写实主义，画出来的物件都是活灵活现，仿佛是立体的一般。上面可以看到他的舒张作品，有兴趣的话可以到他的官网朝圣：http://www.marcellobarenghi.com/ 如果能够把如此的超巨画家带来 Steemit，好处有： 我可以在这里就观赏到他的大作，不用分心上 YouTube。 我可以直接用投票带给他实际的金钱收益。YouTube 上的赞可没什么用。 他可以扩展自己的粉丝群。 他可以有额外的直接金钱收入，没有中介没有抽成。 他几乎不需要做多余的功夫，因为只需把分享在其他网站上的功夫在这里再做一次就好。 我寄了一封电子邮件到他的个人信箱，内容请看上面的英文版本。我简单的介绍了加入 Steemit 会给他带来的好处，同时也用我的绘画帖来作为例子，把赤裸裸的收入摆在他眼前，完全贯彻 Money Talks 的理念。希望可以吸引到他吧。 今天开始我会陆续对我关注的内容作家安利 Steemit 这个平台。当然相对 @jerrybanfield 的 Steemit 广告服务而言我这个是小巫见大巫的。怎样都好，我总是为平台贡献一份棉力了。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Start to bring your favorite content creators to Steemit 把你喜欢的内容创造者带来这里吧’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/start-to-bring-your-favorite-content-creators-to-steemit/"},{"title":"Giants in the Oil sector entering world of Blockchain 能源界巨头们开始进军区块链世界","text":"Numerous energy giant firms are partnering on the blockchain-based technology.

Airdrop is the way Byteball addressed the free distribution of the token as they believe mass adoption requires wide distribution. And that’s the reason 98% of all bytes and Blackbytes are to be distributed for free. I would say this is a genius yet generous way, it got my attention by this very method after all. Smart/Conditional payment is their killer feature, it enables two parties to deal with each other via this feature thus replace the trust between strangers as no scam could be done. For use case example, you may buy a flight delay insurance through the contract and if the negative event happens, you unlock the contract and get paid. Sounds like with the Ethereum Smart Contract but I use neither so cannot comment on them. Byteball has no blockchain and miners (like the IOTA), has chatbots to facilitate operations, features the untraceable Blackbytes, and so on. I won’t go into the whole detail of how Byteball works but you can their official site if interested. They have a really nice build Byteball Wiki site as well. So what happened is, I bought 2G of Byteball at the price of $300 thinking that I could take advantage of the pump before next airdrop. Then our dear BTC went crazy shooting up from $4000 to $6000, and the Byteball dropped to $180 too. I was cold by the fact I made the wrong move and didn’t bother to keep a busy eye on it anymore. Last Monday I opened up my Byteball wallet, felt strange looking at the amount I have first, then realized I have gone through 2 rounds of airdrop. For every 16 BTC you receive 0.1 GB (1 gigabyte = 1 billion bytes), For every 1 GB you receive additional 0.1 GB. According to the official statement, you get 10% extra of your Byteball holding. The 262.56 MB and 288.816 MB was my free distribution from the airdrop. Using today’s rate where 1 GB = $188.17, I have earn [(262.56 + 288.816)*188.17/1000] = extra $103.75. Not bad at all. It is worth mentioning that Byteball is one of the few projects that is extensive at the wallet development. iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and Linux are all supported. Together with their interesting features, this could be the real deal. Anyway, I’m holding for the next airdrop which will be announced in mid-November. 雪球（Byteball）是一个高度利用空投系统的币种，高达 98% 的币都会通过空投的方式发送给特定用户。因为团队相信广泛的持有分配才是变成主流货币的不二之道。这策略还真的是有效，我就是这样被吸引进来的。 先说说雪球的主要功能，其中 Smart/Conditional payment 就是官方号称的杀手锏。陌生人之间无需信任就可以通过这种交易条约功能交易，不会有诈骗的可能性。真实用案里你可以为自己的航班买延误保险，要是航班真的延误了，你就可以解锁条约得到赔偿。听起来其实很象 Ethereum 的 Smart Contract， 由于两者我都没用过所以不予置评了。雪球也不使用传统的区块链，所以也就没有矿工（和 IOTA 很像）。钱包内有内置机器人可以协助日常操作，还有另一种可以躲过所有追查的黑雪球（Blackbytes）。 如果有兴趣了解更多，请前往官网，他们也有着很完善很好读的 Byteball Wiki 。 话说回来，以为下次空投时价格就会大涨的我在三百元时买了 2G 的雪球。不久后比特币就开始暴走了，从四千一路高歌到六千。雪球的也从三百掉到 180 。有点心冷的我就没心情在天天关注了。 上个周一，打开雪球钱包一看，怎么总数变多了？查一查才发现不知不觉度过了两次的空投。按照今天的价格，总共拿了一百元，还是很不错的，心情也没那么郁闷了。 值得一提的是，雪球团队在钱包支援方面做得罕见的好。从 iOS，Android， Windows， Mac， 到 Linux 都有相应的钱包。加上有趣实用的功能特点，相信未来还是大有可为的。不说了，准备接收十一月中旬的空投了。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Byteball airdrop aka free money 雪球派糖好好吃’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/byteball-airdrop-aka-free-money/"},{"title":"Unpleasant malfunction of the rim 老旧的篮筐还换一换了","text":"It’s been our routine to play at this court once in a week right after work.

Got it from a local art store for $20 Singapore Dollar, was hesitated for this steep price for a sketchbook, bought it anyway after failing to find a better alternative. After all, a great sketchbook can produce much bigger value for my art in the coming days. Why toned paper over white paper for drawing? One reason, toned paper is able to show the white you adding in the drawing. I will draw a simple sphere to demonstrate it. 终于卖到心仪已久的 The Grey Book。虽然价格不菲，花了我二十大洋，但由于找不到更好的替身，对艺术创作又不惜代价的我最后还是买了。相信这会是一笔很好的投资。 为什么要使用淡色纸作画？一个原因，就是淡色纸可以很好的显示白色，接下来我会用圆球型简单的示范一下。 The papers inside is grey in color, you can tell that by comparing it to the white label. 这本绘画本是淡灰色的，跟封面标签的纯白色比较不难看得出来。 Recommended by my favorite artist, I also acquired these four Copic markers for $5 each, the most expensive marker I ever had. They are made in Japan anyway. I will be using them in the illustration below. 跟随某位大师的建议，我也入手了一支价格五大洋的 Copic 马克笔，所拥有过最贵的马克笔。买了才发现是日本生产，难怪。以下会用这四支来作画。 The drawingUse the lightest W2 marker to draw the base of the circle. 用最浅的 W2 笔来画出大致圆形。 W5 marker to highlight the shadow to indicate the light direction. 用 W5 笔勾画出影子和光源的方向。 W8 marker will deepen the main shadow. 用 W8 笔加深影子。 And the darkest 110 black marker will be used to outline the sphere, now you might think this should be done here, but we’re not. 然后用最深的黑色笔把轮廓再加强一次，看到这里你会以为大功告成了吧？还没呢。 With the help of a white pencil, I added the white color at the brightest spot of the sphere, and the whole figure stands out now. The overall effect would not be as strong if I draw this on an ordinary white paper. Now you know how a toned paper can really make a difference. 最后是用白色铅笔涂在圆形中最亮的地方，现在整个圆球看起来就立体多了。除了白色笔的功劳，淡色背景更是功不可没。要是同样的图画在普通白纸上，效果肯定没有这次来得突出。 现在你知道淡色纸的强大了吧。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘We should draw on toned paper 今天开始就用淡色纸作画’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/we-should-draw-on-toned-paper/"},{"title":"Challenge the brain by drawing on black paper","text":"I’ve spent almost 2 hours on this artwork. Charcoal pencil on A4 black paper. 这幅作品花了两个小时，用白色炭笔作画于 A4 黑纸上。 As an art adventurer my self, I always looking to try out different art creating techniques. This time I would love to try drawing on black paper. Bought this black sketchbook by Daler Rowney for $18 Singapore dollar, when it comes to art supply, quality is always the top priority for me. This sketchbook features 180g/m and generous 40 pages, I will have a long time to spend on it. The idea of drawing on a black paper initiated by the Hat drawing contest by @helene. The first thing came to my mind was the legendary Michael Jackson and his classic hat. Ironically, I fell for Michael the day he passed away as the television mourning him with the “You Are Not Alone”. I fell in love with this song and immediately searched for all his songs and MV for the next few months, wondering how could I miss this astonishing artist when he was alive. I wished to draw a portrait of him as a gesture of tribute for a long time and this is the chance now. 身为一个艺术冒险家，我时常在寻找不同的创作方式，这次将尝试在黑纸上作画。这本由 Daler Rowney 出品的黑色绘画本价格十八大洋，算是在店里找到最贵的同时也是最好的绘画本。在创作素材上，我永远把品质放在第一位。 这次的新尝试受启发于由 @helene 举办的帽子绘画比赛。第一个点子就是万古不朽的 Michael Jackson 的经典戴帽形象。 很讽刺的，我真正认识 MJ 就是在他去世的那天。当时电视上播放着缅怀 MJ 的《You Are Not Alone》，听到的当下就立马爱上了。接下来的几个月把他所有的作品和 MV 统统翻出来欣赏研究，对这位传奇般的人物彻底心折了。一直想要画个人像来向他致敬，这次机会终于来了。 Drawing breakdownFirst, use a white pencil to sketch with minimal and really light force. You do not want to leave excessive white marks on the black spot which supposed to be dark shadow. 一开始用白笔在黑纸上用最轻最少的线条勾画出轮廓，这样待会会省却很多烦恼。 Starting from the top by toning the hat and face. 然后从帽子和脸部开始上色。 Painting the bright part of the shirt with white charcoal, which should be smudged using kneaded paper. 用更白的白炭笔为衣服的光亮部分上色，然后用纸笔晕染。 Use lighter force for the shallow shadow area. Always remember you are now painting the light instead of dark. 在较浅的暗影部分涂上浅白色，记得现在使用光在作画。 Outline the body with the sparkles of the coat, the little light sketches shall be erased afterward. 把外套闪闪发光的部分点点上色，然后将多余的草稿勾线擦去。 I found that this black paper and white pencil works well with an eraser. Make sure you don’t smudge the white color on the other part as it would be obvious. 黑纸和白铅笔对橡皮擦的效果相当友善，很容易的就把不要的白色部分除去。 Oops, almost forgot the left-hand part and the trouser. 差点忘了加上左手和裤子部分。 Drawing on black paper is fun yet challenging.As this is my first time drawing on black material, I thought should be easy as I just need to paint the bright part and the original black background will do the rest tricks for me. But I was dead wrong. I used to use the black or colored pen to create art, and it already becomes my natural to draw in dark and leave the bright spot empty on white paper. When it comes to black paper and draw with white materials, you need to do exactly the opposite. I was struggling the whole process trying to fight my natural art sense and it all took me two hours to paint the whole figure when I expected to finish it within just one. Nonetheless, I would develop a more comprehensive sense of art creating after this training, not bad. Lastly, I realized this drawing could be improved to a much greater extent and that’s why I make this the Part 1. Stay tuned. 在黑纸上作画，好玩但有挑战性。在此之前，我以为黑纸作画也不怎么难，只需要把光源的部分呈现然后黑色的背景就会自动把暗影表达出来，反而会比在白纸上画画容易吧。 大错特错。 作为一个常年都在用深色笔作画的人，本能就是在白纸上把暗色画出来，把亮色的地方留白。但是用白笔和黑纸，需要做的则是恰恰相反。这次的绘画过程基本上就是和自己的固有价值观在摔跤。要表现暗影时自然的加大力度，结果却是变成了最亮的部分。这也让原本估计一个小时预算时间变成了两个小时。没关系，这样正好可以锻炼脑回路和开发新的艺术视角。 画到最后，我发现其实这幅画还有很大的进步空间，会在下回 Part 2 加强此画，敬请关注。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Challenge the brain by drawing on black paper’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/challenge-the-brain-by-drawing-on-black-paper/"},{"title":"Don't mine for the hackers","text":"It is reported that cryptocurrency mining malware has been breach from thousands of website to Google play store applications.

Together with the stupid frequent ReCaptcha verification, every login now takes me at least 30 seconds. There is nothing I can do with the ReCaptcha as that is one of the system design, but I can simplify the 2FA process.The method is to export credentials of Google Authenticator to the chrome extension Authenticator. Use this trick if: You did not backup the specific app’s credentials (the barcode or manual entry code) when you setting up 2FA with that app. You want to get the 2FA code on a computer instead of phone. Prerequisites: You are using Google Authenticator on an android device. Your device must be rooted. Procedure: In the rooted phone, use a root file explorer to get /data/data/com.google.android.apps.authenticator2/databases/databases and copy it to the computer. In computer, use Notepad++ to open the databases file. You will see lots of “null” characters but skip it all to the bottom of the file, where you see readable text like below and the red part is your credential key. Copy the credential key and insert into Authenticator extension. Authenticator -&gt; Edit button -&gt; Plus button -&gt; Munual Entry Now you can copy the time-based access code using just a click. The 2FA credential is crucial for the security obviously, that’s why you should not store this information in any plain text form. Encrypt it and store it somewhere offline like the USB thumbdrive. The next time you switch your phone or even lost it, you can easily recover the access code. With root access, you can also use the Titanium Backup app to backup Google Authenticator with the credential. You should also start backing up the credential whenever you setting up a new 2FA login for a service. 双重认证（2FA）在黑客病毒猖狂的现在已经变成必要的户口保护手段了，尤其是收藏着重金的加密货币网站更是必不可少。我使用的是 Google Authenticator，由于某个常用的交易网站由于保安原因时常会需要不断的重新登入，把手机上的 Google Authenticator 移上来电脑中的 Chrome 插件 Authenticator 会方便很多。 谁适合服用： 想从电脑上快速获取 2FA 密码的人。 当初没有备份某个服务生成 credentials 的人。 前提条件： Google authenticator 必须运行在安卓手机上。 必须使用拥有超级用户权限的安卓手机 步骤见英文部分。 谁拥有用于密码生成的 credential 就可以生成 2FA access code 登入特定的服务，所以一定做好保护功夫。永远不要保存在纯文字格式。 ​ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Export Google Authenticator credentials to other device 获取2FA生成密码’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/export-google-authenticator-credentials-to-other-device-2fa/"},{"title":"Flagging attack on Steemit?","text":"Yesterday I’ve read some flagging issues here and there. @transisto controversially flagged a couple of famous creators including @michelle.gent, who is a novel author, for Disagreement on reward, Posting a novel page by page, getting ~65$ for ~20 views.

With 1,000,000,000,000 SP, 100% voting power at 100% vote weight worth a whopping $85,670,000. Jezz doesn’t even have to do the dirty work himself, he can use bots to randomize the flagging or just target those star authors. Most payout of the works would be wiped out and users will leave this place as a result. Under current DPOS mechanism, there is nothing can stop him. Of course, I was just exaggerating for this example but this is not entirely impossible, wealthy malicious group or individual are plentiful out there. This attack is not based on the techie liveliness and the 1/3+ attack or whatsoever geeky stuff, it plays fully according to the rule of Steemit: Make someone an overload by investing huge amount of SP, then flagging blindly the whole platform. This was just a weird brainwave without a solid fundamental understanding of the backend technical aspect. Maybe someone can delight me if I’m missing out anything. 有鉴于近来那么多的踩人事件，我突发奇想，发现有种奇葩的攻击 Steemit 方式很可行： 要是有一个好像 Amazon CEO 那么有钱的个人还是团体，投资价值十亿的 SP，然后到处踩人，这里会发生什么事？ 要知道，十亿 SP 在满血状态下 100% 的权重可以达到 $85,670,000，足以踩得这个平台上几乎全部人个天昏地暗。当然这只是个极端的例子，但是绝非没有可能的，当然这对攻击者也不能带来什么好处。 请容许我脑洞大开一回。 Image source This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Flagging attack on Steemit?’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/flagging-attack-on-steemit/"},{"title":"Neo is giving better interest than banks","text":"Picture from the team 3 days ago. Recently NEO and GAS has been rocking up these few days due to the NEO council guy spreading the news that the team is going to make big things happen on 20 Nov, and the rumor was about China might unban ICO under the condition only NEO is used as a smart platform to raise fund. Price will definitely skyrocket if this is happening. So far there is no solid news being announced, and the price has been cooled down to $36 as of now since the recent peak $46. My NEO wallet profile If you don’t already know, holding NEO in your private wallet can claim free GAS as well. This NeoToGas tool can be used to calculate how much GAS you will get given the holding amount of NEO. Base on this tool, my holding of 16 NEO can earn 0.0074 GAS per day, or 0.2286 GAS per month, theoretically. The dividend was calculated base on current price of NEO and GAS, where Anualised return = ([Total GAS claim per year]*[Current price of GAS])/([Total NEO]*[Current price of NEO]) Using current rate, 1 NEO can earn approximately 7% of actual dividend per year, which already on par with the average return of Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market. Don’t forget NEO itself still have a huge room of appreciation to go. 三天前 NEO 团队放消息出来说会搞事情，导致价格大涨。谣言说中国政府会重新开放 ICO，前提是只可以使用 NEO 的智能平台。如果成真，恐怕价格会一飞冲天，但现在看来还没听到什么真实的新闻。 或许有很多人不知道持有 NEO 在私有钱包可以定时领取免费的 GAS 币。利用 NeoToGas 这个工具可以查出目前 NEO 能换取多少 GAS。以我的 16 个 NEO 来说，实际一年可以得到约 1.98 个 GAS。就目前的价格来说，能有足以和传统股票市场媲美的 7% 年化回酬率。而且别忘了 NEO 的价格本身也还有很大的上升空间。 年化回酬率公式如下： 年化回酬率 = ([一年可得的 GAS 总数]*[GAS 当前价格])/([NEO 总数]*[NEO当前价格]) Image source This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Neo is giving better interest than banks’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/neo-is-giving-better-interest-than-banks/"},{"title":"When the self-curse comes true 诅咒成真","text":"We will have a basketball session after work every Wednesday nearby the office.

Just so you know, there are plenty of this kind of channels. Some of them provide crypto signals, some focus on pump and dump which I think is a total waste of time and money. Do not join pump and dump anyway, chances are you keep donating money to the speculators. I firmly believe no one knows anything about the trend of cryptocurrency chart, pure technical analysis or another form of attempts trying to read the chart to predict the price movement simply looking silly to me. However, TA can be very reliable if combined with the news collection. Coins price usually shoot up with good news like being enlisted in an exchange, release of wallet, realization of new feature, release of roadmap and so on. If you are too busy for all these trackings, these signal channels could do the work for you. Profiting exampleThis is how they distribute the signal, normally with buy zone and sell zone. You should set the sell orders accordingly once you bought the coin. Yesterday I somehow accidentally gained the biggest profit with this single signal with CFI because I forgot to set the sell order accordingly. Within 6 hours, my crypto alarm notified me that this coin had rocketed more than 100% and I quickly logged in Bittrex to verify the gain. Holy, I did not set any sell orders! Better do it now. Bought at 0.00001250 and sold all at 0.00002488, I’ve successfully turned 0.06999956 BTC into 0.13863224 BTC. Profited 0.06863268 BTC with 98% gain, equivalent to $680 currently. Example aforementioned was extreme and shall not be taken as usual case. What this channel does is they will keep update you about the coin which they think will rise soon, base on technical analysis and news from the development team or even rumors. Of course, you can search for other channels as there are a lot out there, but in case you are interested their Telegram ID is @HighestPump. I do not get benefit in any form even if you join. Just sharing if you are interested in crypto trading. Tips: Set stop-loss for every signal and actually use them. THIS IS NOT AN FINANCIAL ADVICE, TRADE AT YOUR OWN RISK. 近来迷上了 Telegram 里的加密货币交易频道，还从中稳定的赚了不少，在此想和大家分享心得。Telegram 上有很多此类的频道，在这里奉劝别加入 Pump and Dump 的活动（就是在短时间内把某个冷门币炒高再卖的行为），输多赢少的，而且背后也不知有谁在操纵。我比较喜欢的就是提供 Signal 的频道。 把传统的股票还是外汇（技术分析）技术运用于加密货币市场分析，我觉得是很愚昧的。你不能用旧的观念来尝试分析一些前所未有的东西，但是加上信息的捕捉就不一样了。我们都知道，加密货币的价格很大程度上都会受到消息的影响，被交易所接受，推出新钱包，新功能的实现都可以大大刺激价格。 但是不是每个人都有时间来追踪上百个货币的信息，这时你就需要这类频道来提供可靠的 Signal 告诉你近期有什么项目是大有可为的，从而低价买入高价卖出。 实际赚钱例子上面的的图一就是例子，他们会建议你在什么价位买入，然后设定几个目标价卖出。昨天收到的 CFI signal 是近期误打误撞赚得最多的，因为我买入后忘了照着卖出目标设立 sell order。 而是到晚上才发现已经猛升一倍才赶紧卖了。 图二可以看到在短短六个小时内，我成功的把 0.06999956 BTC 的成本卖出为 0.13863224 BTC。用 98% 的涨幅赚了 0.06863268 BTC，当下等同 $680。 当然上面的是幸运的极端例子，万事还是要照着策略来。这个频道是基于 TA 和近期的风声新闻推荐近期有望上升的币种。当然此类的频道是有很多的，只是我觉得这家很不错。如果你有兴趣，他们的 Telegram ID 是 @HighestPump。纯粹分享，任何人加入我都没收益。 Tips: 一定要设定和执行止损。 以上一切不构成任何投资建议，请自行承担一切风险。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Experience sharing with a profitable trading 追涨杀跌的经验分享’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/experience-sharing-with-a-profitable-trading/"},{"title":"Ways to earn more Bitcoin 如何持有更多比特币","text":"Months ago when a Bitcoin was still under $2000, most of us still manage to buy one or at least a big portion of a single Bitcoin with our monthly income.

If you still hold the one Bitcoin you bought during the day when it was so still affordable, good. However, no matter how high the price goes, you always still holding the same one Bitcoin. What are the possible ways to increase your BTC holding as it is getting out of your league every day? Mine Bitcoin or join cloud mining company I’m not interested in mining considering the high risk of costs. The profitability of mining is decreasing every day too. Maybe you can mine for altcoins and trade it for Bitcoin too. Join Bitcoin giveaway event or high-yield investment programs Best way to waste your time and risks your fund IMO. Keep earning the way you are and buy more Bitcoin This is the slowest way especially BTC is getting more expensive. Increase your income and buy more Bitcoin Works multiple jobs, starts a business, or even hits a jackpot can bring you extra wealth and bring more buying power. But it could be hard to compete when the BTC goes bullish. Trade altcoins with Bitcoin, profitably. This may be the fastest way to increase Bitcoin amount, if you can do it PROFITABLY, of course. Else this could be a great way to lose your one and only Bitcoin, too bad. If you are no expert but still want to give it a try, maybe you can start trading in small amount following signal channels. To the moon! 数个月前当比特币还是低于 $2000 时，多数人还是有能力起码买到或是一个比特币的。但是以现在疯狂的 $11,000 价位，买一个比特币的理想似乎离普通人越来越远了。 如果你还持着当初廉价买来的一个比特币，恭喜你。但是无论价钱升的多高，一个比特币始终是一个。在价钱日渐高不可攀的今日，有什么方法可以增加持有量呢？ 自行挖矿或云端挖矿 我对挖矿不是很有兴趣，主要是因为成本风险太高，收益效应每一天也在降低。但或许可以考虑去挖别的币种来换成比特币。 参加比特币免费派送活动或是高收益投资项目（HYIP） 浪费时间和亏钱的最佳方法。 以现有的收入继续入手比特币 要是比特币持续这种涨势，这是最慢的方法。 增加收入来购买比特币 身兼数职，开始经商，甚至是中大彩都可以带来额外的财富从而有能力入手大量比特币。但是收入的增长速度要跟上疯牛般的比特币，似乎有点难度。 在加密货币市场中交易 这是最快增加比特币的方法，前提是你要有本事从险恶的市场中有稳定的发挥。似乎有点废话啊。当然这也可以是让你丢光你仅有的比特币的最佳途径。但要是你有兴趣尝试同时又不是高手，或许可以考虑拿出一小部分根据 Signal 频道的信息来交易。 比特币，勇往直前吧!

The balance went missing is a result of IOTA network snapshot from 22nd September. Don’t worry, you fund is still safe inside the Tangle. Follow the simple steps below to reclaim all your balance. Get the latest wallet from iotaledger: https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet/releases. The latest version is v2.5.4, download whatever is applicable to your operating system. I’m using windows so I’m going to use the exe file. Login the wallet using your old seed. You don’t have to generate a new seed for this. Always backup the seed and keep it safe. After login, you will notice you still have the 0 balance. Access the Edit Node Configuration under the Tools. Change the Min Weight Magnitude to 14 and make sure Curl Implementation is Webgl 2 Curl Implementation. Save it. Then Generate Address and Attach to Tangle. The balance shall reappears under the Receive tab. You may want to do this repeatedly until all the fund is fully claimed. If you previously have received 5 transaction into this wallet, you should at least to see same number of transfer under the History tab. If you are still having issues please try changing nodes, rebooting wallet and redo the process again. You can also try to get help from https://iotatangle.slack.com. If you need an invite see https://slack.iota.org. This “fund missing: incident might be frightening to the non-techie person. But as long as you keep your seed well-kept you will always be fine.

This was ordered at EUR 45 during the Black Friday deal which offered 21% discount, the overall experience is also complimented by the speedy DHL shipping service. The Walk-through The first impression was the packaging. I have to say Ledger paid close attention to their product packaging, the box itself just feels a lot more premium than the Trezor’s. The minimal design on the front is very much appealing too. The Nano S is secured firmly in the protective foam. So far there is no anti-tampering sticker on this box like what Trezor did with their box. Ledger claims that the wallet is built on a distinctive operating system (OS) called BOLOS which is tamper resistant. The EAL 5+ certified secure chip we are using is the same one on your credit card or in your passport. Hacking a secure chip takes formidable efforts while information can be easily extracted from generic microcontrollers by amateurs. In other words, Ledger Nano S is physically unhackable so they would not even bother to prove its authenticity with packaging tricks. A small envelope consists of three pieces of paper. From left to right, they are: Recovery phrase sheet to backup the seed while setting up the wallet. There are only one and I would suggest it is better to backup on another piece of paper as well. Redundancy never goes wrong. Explanation of why the box isn’t using an anti-tempering sticker. Simple instruction to start setting up the wallet. Bunch of accessories like the key ring, key chain, USB cable, and necklace. The detachable necklace is what surprise me the most. Now you can carry the precious wallet with all fund inside with you whenever you go. Although I doubt that would be a good idea. Front and back of the Nano S. An interesting phrase Vires in numeris was printed on the back. After some googling, that is a sentence in Latin meaning “Strength in numbers”, which is also the tagline of Bitcoin. Indeed, the whole idea of cryptocurrency is just dealing with all kind of numbers. Two buttons at the bottom of the screen. They will be responsible for all the operations. Nano S use a USB drive-like design with a joint to protect the screen and USB port. As you can see in the GIF, the joint is strong and doesn’t wobble at all. The sturdiness of small detail like this definitely convinces users on the build quality. The ThoughtsIn the sense of packaging and build quality, I would say Ledger Nano S with a cheaper price tag already surpassed Trezor in many ways. More accessories, beautiful box architecture, and great wallet design. Of course, we cannot judge the wallet simply by its physical appearance. We shall cover more in the wallet configuration and software part. Til then.

The AES-256 algorithm uses cipher key with length of 256 bits. To create that key 7-Zip uses derivation function based on SHA-256 hash algorithm. A key derivation function produces a derived key from text password defined by user. For increasing the cost of exhaustive search for passwords 7-Zip uses big number of iterations to produce cipher key from text password. We will try to make use of this strong and free encryption feature to protect our vital cryptocurrency information. OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit7-zip version: 7-Zip 17.01 beta (2017-08-28) for Windows The walk-through I store all my wallets under a directory with simple architecture like this. We will use the STEEM wallet as example for this tutorial. Inside of the STEEM folder there are two files, the portable Vessel wallet for Steem and a plain text file that stores all the private keys for Steem including Owner key, Active key, and Post key. One must never store sensitive data like such digitally in plain text. And we are going to encrypt this text file using 7-zip. Download latest version of 7-zip from the official site. After installation, right click on the text file. 7-zip -&gt; Add to archive. You can either choose 7z or zip format in the Archive format. Make sure the encryption algorithm is set to AES-256, this should be the only option if you are using the latest version of 7-zip. Lastly, create a strong password which is very important to increase the difficulty when someone trying to crack the encryption. The stronger the password the stronger your encryption is. Press OK to start the archiving. Now you will have an encrypted archive in 7z format. Open it up and to make sure you see the + sign under the Encrypted column. Unlock the file to check if everything is OK before next step. Permanently delete the plain text file by Shift + Del keys. Make sure no copy of the text file should be existing in any place including the recycle bin. Remember all the sensitive credentials in digital form should always be encrypted.

However, it doesn’t support to encrypt new files into an encrypted archive. The old and inefficient way to achieve this is to decrypt the old archive, make a new archive with the new items, and encrypt everything again. This is ridiculous when you just want to add a 10kb release note into a 1G archive. That computing power wasted could better spend at cryptocurrency mining. The problem In the encrypted 7z file we can see that the Encrypted column for the Old item.txt is a +, meaning this file is encrypted. You can practice this walk-through by creating a simple testing file like this. Now we wish to add a new item to the current archive without decrypting. Drag and drop the New item.txt into the archive and press Yes. Under Encrypted property, there is a - sign for the new item while the old item is still encrypted. By opening up both files, you still need to provide the password for the Old item.txt while New item.txt is can be opened without one.This status remains even if you close and reopen the archive. There is no option in the tools or whatsoever to encrypt new files in the archive. The Solution How should we make things right by having the new file encrypted using same algorithm and password like the old file did?Remove the new item first. Proceed to right click on the blank place of the archive and click on Open Inside. Provide the password and now the whole archive is decrypted. Verify the encryption status by opening up the files again. Drag and drop the New item.txt again to the decrypted archive and press Yes. Now you will see both files are encrypted with the +sign. But you are still in the decryption status, to resume the encryption simply close the archive. The next time you open either file in the archive they will prompt you for the same password. This trick is extremely handy when you want to add a few files to an encrypted archive without having to first decrypt the old archive and redo the archiving with encryption again.

In Windows platform, the Snipping Tool is one of my best friends and I thought it was easy to use and handy to perform the simple print screen job until I met ShareX. I would not even say ShareX is the Snipping Tool on steroid. If Snipping Tool is a rookie, ShareX is the Michael Jordan on the court. While the former just able to simply capture screen via usual rectangle or free form, and provide some simple tool like Pen or Highlighter to edit. ShareX is a monster who can do way more than that. ShareX is a free and open source program that lets you capture or record any area of your screen and share it with a single press of a key. It also allows uploading images, text or other types of files to over 80 supported destinations you can choose from. Github repo: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareXOfficial site: https://getsharex.com/Platform: Windows The Walk-Through This is the main interface which might seem complicated than the innocent looking of Snipping Tool, one should get along very well with it after 10 minutes of some practicing. Left sidebar consists of all the features with the four main functions at the top: Capture, Upload, Workflows, and Tools. Capture Plenty of capture mode to choose from. We got the usual Fullscreen and Region (custom) capture. An advanced function like Screen recording (GIF) is just wonderful in creating a simple GIF right from this tool without much post-edit effort. Scrolling capture works great in capturing multiple pages of a webpage into a single long image. Text capture is can transform an image of the selected region into manageable text form using OCR. Under the Window, all the running windows in your session is showing on the list. Simply click one to capture it’s current window screen. No dragging and selecting is needed. Same thing works if you have multiple monitors and you will be able to just print screen the whole monitor status with just a click. Upload One of the features that make ShareX outstanding is the ability to upload almost anything to the selected destinations. Files, folders, text, or whatever in your current clipboard. Each type of the uploading content will have it’s dedicated site to send to. These are all the file hosting site that you can authorize ShareX to have access to. From the famous Google Drive to Hostr which most people never heard of. For text content, there are 10 options including Pastebin and Paste2. For images, we have Imgur, ImageShack, TinyPic and so on. From the famous Google Drive to Hostr which most people never heard of. For text content, there are 10 options including Pastebin and Paste2. For images, we have Imgur, ImageShack, TinyPic and so on. Sharing new screenshot or record with them is now seamless and almost effortless. Workflows This basically is the list of hotkeys which to start certain capture mode. I personally find the Capture region and Start screen recording workflows to be my most frequent move. This is highly dependent on personal preference, set up your most used three to four workflows as hotkey is recommended. To make sure the workflows is always ready to be summoned, it’s best to start the ShareX every time Windows boots up. Enable this option by Application Settings -&gt; Integration -&gt; Check the Runs ShareX when Windows start. Once you are familiar with these hotkeys, screen capturing is as smooth as typing and clicking. Tools Now from the Tool list you can clearly tell the ShareX is not just powerful, but it is also overwhelming. There is even a DNS Changer that you can set up preferred and alternate DNS server and apply. Not sure what a networking tool like this has anything to do with a screenshot software, but I guess this is to compliment the Uploading feature. Image Editor is so far my most favourite tool which you can straight edit all the capture without having to rely on external editing software like the Microsoft Paint. I’m not yet diving into every single tool listed here but the tool names suggest precisely what it does. I shall share more on this if I found any of them to be useful in the future. After capture tasks This is what decides the program to do after every capture. Enabled options are highlighted in bold characters. In this case, I enabled the Copy image to clipboard and Save image to file as. The former save the most recent capture in clipboard so I can immediately Ctrl + V paste to external image editor or messaging application to share the picture. The latter ask me every time in what name and what place I would like to save the capture. You may change it to “Save image to file” if you desire the default setting. ConclusionThe long features of ShareX may sounds overkill actually it is not. It is relatively lightweight compared to the Windows Snipping Tool, costs around 65Mb vs 6Mb while provides at least 15x more functions. It would be great even if you just make use of the capture function. I shall share more about this amazing tool soon. Try this out if you are screen capturing or recording a lot. You are welcome.

Previously when I use the default screen capturing tool in Windows, Snipping Tool to capture screen, often I will have to edit the picture with Microsoft Paint to make simple adjustment such like adding arrows, text, or brackets. The flow of overall process was Start Snipping Tool -&gt; Open capture mode -&gt; Capure screen -&gt; Save as picture -&gt; Look for picture location -&gt; Edit with Paint -&gt; Save and done Using ShareX, the process will be Start ShareX in capture mode Hotkey -&gt; Capture screen -&gt; Edit with ShareX -&gt; Save and done I’ll show you the basic screen capturing process and the awesome edit feature. The Walk-Through Ignite ShareX region capture mode by Ctrl + Print Screen. The selection will form a dotted-line region on objects, click once to capture whatever inside the bracket or you can just click and drag over the screen for custom capture. The captured image will be generated in the file list, we are using the 1.png in this example . Right-click on the image and select Edit image, this will start the built-in editor. There is a top bar with a series of editing tools like drawing rectangle and circle, text, arrow, blur effect, crop image and so on. Drawing Circle and Rectangle is a very basic feature of most editors. Default color is red which is suitable for emphasizing in an image. You can draw the form and later change the shape and size as well the as the position. Drawing Steps is useful in introducing procedure by adding numbering at random places.Drawing Text and Drawing speech balloon can be used to adding explanation or note.Both of the results can be altered as desired after first creation. Drawing Cursor enabling user to add mouse cursor in any place. This trick could be used in a tutorial image to tell the reader where to click on the corresponding image. Effect Blur and Effect Pixelate are really useful in hiding sensitive information in an image which could be the car number plate, home address, name of a person, face of a person and contact number etc. Crop Image is a vital tool in simple image editing tool to get rid with the unwanted portion of the photo or you might just want to crop to better ratio. Tips: Beware this is a dangerous tool here as the image will be cropped the moment you release the click as you can see in the GIF. And there will be no “Undo” option to go back after the crop which I think this can be the next improvement. Image allows user to flip and rotate an image. Horizontally and vertically flipping, 90 and 180 degrees rotating. Also, image and canvas size can be altered using this tool too. Drawing Image is one of the more advanced features to allow a user to duplicate selected portion and drag it around to cover the other part of a photo. In the GIF, I managed to cover up the image preview with the alpha background. This to me is really convenient as I won’t need to access the Gimp or Photoshop to achieve the same effect. ConclusionThe edit function is a killer feature for me to be a big fan of ShareX. It tremendously simplifies the process of creating a meaningful screenshot in no time.

As an absolute plankton, I always looking for ways to increase the payout of my posts. And I’ve tried everything possible to achieve that, buying votes, renting SP, and so on. All of these were based on the expense of using your SP or SBD. While @qurator provides an awesome upvoting service without consuming your assets. How thing works As you can see the table taken from their recent post, there are 6 Tiers from Tier 0 to Tier 5 with the higher tier granted with higher upvoting weight. The highest tier one can achieve without spending SP is Tier 2, which requires to upvote the daily qurator 7 times a week. As the @qurator keeping to post every day, all you have to do is upvote at least 7 of them. Easy, right? Here I show you how to make a one-off setup and get the free upvotes forever. The Walkthrough First you have to register to become a member and the registration fee is 2 Steem/SBD. We clearly are going to send the Steem during this SBD-frenzy period($1.93 vs $10.26). 1) In your own Steemit profile, select Wallet. Under the Steem wallet selectTransfer. 2) Set **qurator** in theTocolumn. 3) Set theAmount` to 2.4) Submit. Now you will have basic upvote which is 1.2% for life. Unless you decided to vote manually, next we are going to setup auto vote for @qurator via Steemvoter: https://steemvoter.com/ If you haven’t already signed up: Sign up using an email address and a set of username and password just like every other simple site. Press on Add Account. Then you will have to input your Steem account name and the private posting key as the service will need that to vote on your behalf. Select Rulesand this will be the place you set up the rules for the bot to follow.Put qurator under the Author of posts to vote on. Account name supposed to be your own Steem account. Leave the default value for the Vote Delay in Minutes. Vote Power Percentage should be at least make your vote worth $0.01. If you are really low on SP and couldn’t generate even $0.01 at 100%, put 100% then. This is to discourage capable members from voting 1% just to take advantage of the system which sounds pretty fair to me. Refer to the this statement: 1% = $0.00 will not be counted100% = $0.00 will be countedAny % = at least $0.01 will be counted Make sure the Make this Rule Active is ticked and Save Rule. In the same page, you shall see a new rule was set and ready. You may further manage this rule by the Delete and Edit options. Since this is your first time setting up Steemvoter service, you want to make sure everything is working properly where the bot is actually executing your rules. In the homepage, there is a Logsto record what the bot has voted in a long list. In the image above I can tell that a recent vote on a post from @qurator was a success. Other than this way, you can too visit the @qurator page every now and then to make sure your vote is cast. @qurator will update the “Qurator Tiers and Upvote Weights Update“ once in a while so you can make sure your name appears correspondingly. The upvote weight and upvote worth will change slightly over time. Above shows the latest stats and you can see that Tier 2 are getting $0.35 vote every day at the cost of 7 votes, not bad at all. You should soon see you appear in Tier 2. Enjoy the free vote!

In Windows platform, the Snipping Tool is one of my best friends and I thought it was easy to use and handy to perform the simple print screen job until I met ShareX. I would not even say ShareX is the Snipping Tool on steroid. If Snipping Tool is a rookie, ShareX is the Michael Jordan on the court. While the former just able to simply capture screen via usual rectangle or free form, and provide some simple tool like Pen or Highlighter to edit. ShareX is a monster who can do way more than that. ShareX is a free and open source program that lets you capture or record any area of your screen and share it with a single press of a key. It also allows uploading images, text or other types of files to over 80 supported destinations you can choose from. Github repo: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareXOfficial site: https://getsharex.com/Platform: Windows The Walk-Through This is the main interface which might seem complicated than the innocent looking of Snipping Tool, one should get along very well with it after 10 minutes of some practicing. Left sidebar consists of all the features with the four main functions at the top: Capture, Upload, Workflows, and Tools. Capture Plenty of capture mode to choose from. We got the usual Fullscreen and Region (custom) capture. An advanced function like Screen recording (GIF) is just wonderful in creating a simple GIF right from this tool without much post-edit effort. Scrolling capture works great in capturing multiple pages of a webpage into a single long image. Text capture is can transform an image of the selected region into manageable text form using OCR. Under the Window, all the running windows in your session is showing on the list. Simply click one to capture it’s current window screen. No dragging and selecting is needed. Same thing works if you have multiple monitors and you will be able to just print screen the whole monitor status with just a click. Upload One of the features that make ShareX outstanding is the ability to upload almost anything to the selected destinations. Files, folders, text, or whatever in your current clipboard. Each type of the uploading content will have it’s dedicated site to send to. These are all the file hosting site that you can authorize ShareX to have access to. From the famous Google Drive to Hostr which most people never heard of. For text content, there are 10 options including Pastebin and Paste2. For images, we have Imgur, ImageShack, TinyPic and so on. From the famous Google Drive to Hostr which most people never heard of. For text content, there are 10 options including Pastebin and Paste2. For images, we have Imgur, ImageShack, TinyPic and so on. Sharing new screenshot or record with them is now seamless and almost effortless. Workflows This basically is the list of hotkeys which to start certain capture mode. I personally find the Capture region and Start screen recording workflows to be my most frequent move. This is highly dependent on personal preference, set up your most used three to four workflows as hotkey is recommended. To make sure the workflows is always ready to be summoned, it’s best to start the ShareX every time Windows boots up. Enable this option by Application Settings -&gt; Integration -&gt; Check the Runs ShareX when Windows start. Once you are familiar with these hotkeys, screen capturing is as smooth as typing and clicking. Tools Now from the Tool list you can clearly tell the ShareX is not just powerful, but it is also overwhelming. There is even a DNS Changer that you can set up preferred and alternate DNS server and apply. Not sure what a networking tool like this has anything to do with a screenshot software, but I guess this is to compliment the Uploading feature. Image Editor is so far my most favourite tool which you can straight edit all the capture without having to rely on external editing software like the Microsoft Paint. I’m not yet diving into every single tool listed here but the tool names suggest precisely what it does. I shall share more on this if I found any of them to be useful in the future. After capture tasks This is what decides the program to do after every capture. Enabled options are highlighted in bold characters. In this case, I enabled the Copy image to clipboard and Save image to file as. The former save the most recent capture in clipboard so I can immediately Ctrl + V paste to external image editor or messaging application to share the picture. The latter ask me every time in what name and what place I would like to save the capture. You may change it to “Save image to file” if you desire the default setting. ConclusionThe long features of ShareX may sounds overkill actually it is not. It is relatively lightweight compared to the Windows Snipping Tool, costs around 65Mb vs 6Mb while provides at least 15x more functions. It would be great even if you just make use of the capture function. I shall share more about this amazing tool soon. Try this out if you are screen capturing or recording a lot. You are welcome.

The most I did with the reward was just trading STEEM/SBD, or buy some Cardano with the hot SBD which obviously turned out to be a great buy-in surging from $0.13 to $0.4 as of now. This makes me never realize how profitable for Steemit writer given the recent SBD frenzy and rise of STEEM price. I’m a Malaysian where the national average salary is about RM4279 (about US$987) per month. How much should I make in the author reward if I wish to make a living out of SBD? Let’s do the mathAssumptions: There are 30 days in a month Make one post every day Rewards payout in (50%/50%) In order to make $987 (about RM4279), I will have to make 987/30 = $32.9 per day. One SBD equals to $11.35 at the moment, I will need to make 3 SBD if I author a post every day. According to the formula, Author reward in SBD = (Total post payout * 0.75)/2 We know that we are going to make 3 SBD hence the formula to find out Total post payout will be Total post payout = (3*2)/0.75 And the answer is $8 that we are going to score a post. ThoughtsWith some consistency, one can easily hit that $8 average payout. You can pull that number drastically up to at least $20 by being a quality contributor for @utopian-io. Not to mention that you can combine tricks like buying or selling votes, renting SP, or making use of quality service like @qurator to score consistent upvotes. This is quite mind-blowing considering all one has to do is to make an average $8 payout to match our national average income at RM4279. In fact, most of my fellow Malaysians are not even making that much in their current job (under 30 years old). Keep writing and the surprise will be waiting for you ahead. 我从没把 Steemit 上赚到的钱提现，在最近 Steem 发力和 SBD 疯狂发力之下，想算一算到底需要多少 SBD 才抵得上马来西亚的人均收入。 算法前提：一个月里有三十天，每天发一篇文，用 50/50 作为奖励方式。 马来西亚的平均月收入大约为美金 $987，意味着我每天必须赚取987 (近 RM4279)，意味着我每天必须赚取 987/30 = $32.9。 一个 SBD 目前价格为 $11.35，那就是每一篇文都必须有 3 SBD 的分成。 参考以下的公式， Author reward in SBD = (Total post payout * 0.75)/2 把 3 代入 Author reward in SBD ，算得 Total post payout 的公式成了 Total post payout = (3*2)/0.75 答案就是 $8。 感想平均每篇文 $8 真心不高，如果利用 @utopian-io 更可以大大提高到起码 $20。更不用说那些买卖赞和租借 SP 的小伎俩。还有利用 Qurator 高素质服务也可收取一定的点赞。 事实上，身边的同龄朋友们（30岁以下）多数都没有达到所谓的平均月收入，这就让演算结果更让人震惊了。我所 follow 的写手中有好多每篇收入都是 30 以上，这样的收入目前而言想必在许多国家都很吃得开了。 Image source This page is synchronized from the post: ‘How much do a Malaysian need to make a living out of SBD?’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/how-much-a-malaysian-need-make-a-living-out-of-sbd/"},{"title":"Drawing Challenge#12 - Women on a chair 椅子上的女人 ","text":"I’ve spent 3 hours on this artwork mainly using Copic Markers and white pen on a grey book. This is an entry for the People On The Chair drawing contest hosted by @helene. At first, I looked at this theme and thought it was quite a dull idea. The first thing came to my mind was who am I going to draw sitting on a chair. What is the sitting pose and who that going to be, must be a celebrity since there is no way to make my entry outstanding. But I was dead wrong. After studying more about the materials, I found out the theme was actually really brilliant. Any people on any chair would match the theme and that absolutely should not limit to sitting only. And the chair is in no way should be restricted to ordinary four-legged chairs. It could be a criminal being executed on an electricity chair, people thrilled on a roller coaster chair, dance on a chair, a king sitting on a throne, and so on. The pose combined the type of chair is definitely a good way to tell a story. My material this time is a depressed lady who is being tied down to a chair. Is she suffer from home violence? Being kidnapped? Interrogation? Or she was just playing games with someone? She might not even be depressed at all! Your guess. 这幅作品花了三个小时，主要适用马克笔和白墨笔在灰色画本上作画。这同时也是 @helene 举办的椅子上的人绘画比赛的参赛作品。 一开始看到绘画主题我是有点纳闷的，不就是一个人坐在椅子上，太没有创意发挥的空间了。便开始想要画哪些明星好让作品更鹤立鸡群。 大错特错。 经过一番详细的琢磨后，我发现这题目并不简单。椅子上的人不一定是坐着的，也可以是站趟睡等等。还有椅子本身也不一定是普通的四角椅子。两种变数结合起来就是各种有趣的故事了。那可以是坐在电椅上的死囚，坐在王位上的皇者，过山车位子上享受激情的路人。椅子的形态和人的姿势就很可以把一个无声的故事表达出来。 这次的题材是一个被束缚在椅子上的看起来很消沉的女人。她是被绑架了？被审问？受家暴？还是正在和谁玩些什么游戏？她可能一点都不消沉！打开脑洞猜一猜也挺有趣的。 The Drawing Breakdown This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Drawing Challenge#12 - Women on a chair 椅子上的女人 ‘ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/drawing-challenge-12-women-on-a-chair/"},{"title":"Cheers to the big green day 一片绿","text":"We’ve reached an all-time-high market cap which is $638,678,051,703 as of now.

The Walkthrough .gif) Ledger does not have an in-built battery and it has to be plugged to a computer in order to power up. Plug it up with micro-USB cable and you shall see the welcome message telling you that “Pressing both buttons to start“. Press the corresponding tick button to configure as a new device. The very first step will be setting up a PIN code which will be used to access your device every time. Press both buttons to proceed. The total digit for the PIN would be four. Left button to decrease the number and right button to increase. Confirm the current number by pressing both buttons, and proceed set the next digit. If you want to undo any mistake and to retype again. Cycle the digit to above 9 or below 0 there will be an Erase button. Pressing both button and the previously entered digit will be removed so that you can insert a new one again. After inserting four digits the fifth digit will be a Tick sign. Confirm and proceed to retype the four-digit PIN again. The third step I would say is the most crucial step throughout the whole setup process, backup the recovery phrase. This recovery phrase is all you have to own to restore your whole device in case you forgot the PIN that you’ve just set, or lost the physical device. Never reveal this to anyone unless you decided to let them own all of your digital assets inside. Write down the 24-word of recovery phrase following the sequence on the Recovery Sheet that comes in the box. Use a non-erasable pen to do it and you may want to copy the phrase to another piece of paper just for the sake of redundancy. After all 24 words have cycled through the final step is to confirm that what you have written down on paper is correct. The Ledger will prompt you to enter a word at a certain position. For example, it would ask you to Select word #23. Use the button to navigate the options and press both buttons to confirm the answer.The process will repeat for four times. You’ve had now gave a PIN to your Ledger and wrote down the recovery phrase. Your device is now ready to use. Content of the device There are some installed applications inside which is Bitcoin wallet, Ethereum wallet, Fido U2F, and Settings. We will not talk much about the Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet as that should be in another guide. In the Settings -&gt; Display -&gt; Brightness, you can adjust the brightness of the device from 1 to 6 degree. The default value is 3. Settings -&gt; Display -&gt; Rotate to make a 180 degree rotation for the display. You can make use of this feature to decide your buttons at the top or bottom. In this case, if I rotate my default screen then I will have to use the button at the bottom using other fingers like the thumbs. Not bad for having this option for a more personalized experience. You can even set the positive screen for a negative one. Personally I’ prefer the default positive display. Inside Settings -&gt; Security -&gt; Auto-lock, you can set a certain timeout period to auto-lock the device just to reduce the chance that you might accidentally leave your device opened while you are away. By doing Settings -&gt; Device -&gt; Reset all you are going to lose everything in the device and do a factory reset to hold nothing, exactly like how it was first created. You will need to provide the PIN to perform this action. Use this with caution. Conclusion Ledger Nano S is a wonderful hardware wallet with a huge set of features to play with. Protect your 24-word recovery seed. Remember your PIN.

Finance2017 has been an awesome year for me financially. Stepped into the world of cryptocurrency from June, I’ve tripled my net worth to SGD 70k thanks to the awesome performance of Bitcoin and altcoins. I had a non-written goal starting this year which is to make extra SGD 20k excluding my salary. To be honest I had no clue how should I achieve this, but always keeping the money-minder focus, things seemed to worked out unexpectedly well. WorkMy career life has been normal like past few years. In fact, as I devoted most of my free time in cryptocurrency, this had somehow drew my energy away from my work. At some point of time I even thought my current job was being redundant as I found that you can easily make more in the virtual world than what I could in this job. After all, as an system administrator I finally figured that this can be the most suitable job to combine with my new passion in cryptocurrency. Love my job again.

So the first thing I recommended to my girlfriend when she want to upgrade her was the latest model from the same brand, OnePlus 5T. Simplistic box in white color. Right after the top cover was removed. Elegant way to present the phone at the first sight. Four little bumps in the corner to help stabilize the device. We bought the China version so the back was a label full of Chinese which can be removed with just a pull. Unlike the previous models, this time the company decided to give away a free transparent case which I thought was rubbish but to my surprise it turned out to be a really good case. Together there is a simple guide and sim tool as well. Still doesn’t come with earphone though. Dash charge is one of the killer features of OnePlus. One hour charging session will almost get your phone fully charged. The only drawback is both the specific adapter and cable must be used in pair to activate the ultra fast Dash charge. In my view this phone is awesome because: Unbeatable value. Pricing at 2999 RMB for flagship specifications that you can find on the Samsung.

Total value reported was over £25000. A huge amount of money indeed. This is definitely shocking and I was wondering how could this happen? I own a Trezor and Ledger and nothing bad has happened to me yet. Digging down the story which you can view at the original Reddit post here, not to my surprise everything was due to scam and human error. How could this happen? The scam part The victim bought a Ledger wallet from eBay seller that comes with a fake Recovery Sheet which has the 24-word phrases already written on it. It then guided the victim to activate the wallet by using this recovery seed. The fake recovery seed looks like: Image from https://imgur.com/DsICkge Obviously the scammer also holds another copy of the same seed while the victim thought he was the only one who holds it. When the victim restores the wallet using that seed, same balance of coin was showing up in the device of both the scammer and victim. Next thing, scammer moved all the coins to his another wallet, of course. The human error part Lack of knowledge, the victim did not know what he was doing at all. I’m not sure how much he did to educate himself. But in this case, he clearly does not know how does a hardware wallet works. If he is well informed, all the traps that the scammer set up in the compromised Ledger package would not work at all at the first sight. And if he refers to the official or reliable source of information while setting up the wallet. He would know that he can actually generate a new seed but not using the shady one on the sheet. What’s the lesson? Always buy hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger from official site if you want to be 100% safe. Educate yourself. If you wouldn’t, no one else would. In the crypto world, you are your own bank. You take full responsibility for your assets. Know what you are doing or don’t do it at all! 简要： 有位网友在第三方买了 Ledger 的硬件钱包结果钱全被盗了。追根究底，原来他买的钱包被人改过了包装，里头教他使用一张写好回复密码的 24 字种子来设置钱包。而事实是诈骗者也拥有同样的种子，所以双方都可以进入同一个钱包。当受害人把钱币都存进去的时候，诈骗者就立马把钱都转走了。 我们可以从中得到什么教训呢？ 只从官方渠道购买钱包 这样就只会买到原装正品，可以大大降低被盗的风险。 自己要有足够的相关知识 这是最重要的。在加密货币的世界你就是你自己的银行，如果你也不知道自己在干什么，那么就等于玩火，出事了都不知哪里出的问题。 以这个事件为例，要是受害人知道钱包是如何运作的，一开始他就不会掉入这陷阱。退一步而言，要是他根据官方的指南设定钱包，他也会知道恢复种子是什么。而不会去用那假种子而导致损失。 币圈里安全是第一位的，弄丢了就找不回来了。谨记谨记！ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Cryptocurrency stolen from a Ledger wallet 钱包被黑’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/cryptocurrency-stolen-from-a-ledger-wallet/"},{"title":"The world of ice 冰糖世界","text":"While I witnessed my first ever snow.

Plug it up with micro-USB cable and you shall see the welcome message telling you that “Pressing both buttons to start“. Press the corresponding tick button to configure as a new device. The very first step will be setting up a PIN code which will be used to access your device every time. Press both buttons to proceed. The total digit for the PIN would be four. Left button to decrease the number and right button to increase. Confirm the current number by pressing both buttons, and proceed set the next digit. If you want to undo any mistake and to retype again. Cycle the digit to above 9 or below 0 there will be an Erase button. Pressing both button and the previously entered digit will be removed so that you can insert a new one again. After inserting four digits the fifth digit will be a Tick sign. Confirm and proceed to retype the four-digit PIN again. The third step I would say is the most crucial step throughout the whole setup process, backup the recovery phrase. This recovery phrase is all you have to own to restore your whole device in case you forgot the PIN that you’ve just set, or lost the physical device. Never reveal this to anyone unless you decided to let them own all of your digital assets inside. Write down the 24-word of recovery phrase following the sequence on the Recovery Sheet that comes in the box. Use a non-erasable pen to do it and you may want to copy the phrase to another piece of paper just for the sake of redundancy. After all 24 words have cycled through the final step is to confirm that what you have written down on paper is correct. The Ledger will prompt you to enter a word at a certain position. For example, it would ask you to Select word #23. Use the button to navigate the options and press both buttons to confirm the answer.The process will repeat for four times. You’ve had now gave a PIN to your Ledger and wrote down the recovery phrase. Your device is now ready to use. Content of the device There are some installed applications inside which is Bitcoin wallet, Ethereum wallet, Fido U2F, and Settings. We will not talk much about the Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet as that should be in another guide. In the Settings -&gt; Display -&gt; Brightness, you can adjust the brightness of the device from 1 to 6 degree. The default value is 3. Settings -&gt; Display -&gt; Rotate to make a 180 degree rotation for the display. You can make use of this feature to decide your buttons at the top or bottom. In this case, if I rotate my default screen then I will have to use the button at the bottom using other fingers like the thumbs. Not bad for having this option for a more personalized experience. You can even set the positive screen for a negative one. Personally I’ prefer the default positive display. Inside Settings -&gt; Security -&gt; Auto-lock, you can set a certain timeout period to auto-lock the device just to reduce the chance that you might accidentally leave your device opened while you are away. By doing Settings -&gt; Device -&gt; Reset all you are going to lose everything in the device and do a factory reset to hold nothing, exactly like how it was first created. You will need to provide the PIN to perform this action. Use this with caution. The Thoughts Ledger Nano S is a wonderful hardware wallet with huge set of features to play with. Solid build quality.

For those coins that not yet receive native support from the hardware wallet, I will have them stored in the desktop private wallets, like the Cardano, Bitshare, IOTA, and much more. I have a spreadsheet managing all the long-term coins. Whatever gets in my private wallets gets onto the list. That spreadsheet serves as a one-stop station that I could review the amount, cost, performance at a glance. And I strongly suggest that all the crypto investors to start doing such accounting for the coin holdings. One should always be able to tell the overall picture of their current investment. No limited to cryptocurrency only but including stocks, property etc. The growth portionThis is the interesting part. You think that when you 1 BTC already gained value by rising from $1,000 to $15,000? Partially true. Don’t forget we are talking value in the cryptocurrency portfolio, where you should discuss value in BTC equivalent but not fiat Dollar. Your 1 BTC is still 1 BTC. You won’t be earning BTC while holding BTC. In the growth portion, I reinvest the rest 60% BTC into altcoins by either trading actively on exchanges or involved in the potential ICO that I believe will have a place in the competitive crypto world. So the fund is all laying on the hands of centralized exchanges or ICO developers. I certainly felt uneasy about the security but couldn’t find a better solution. Until decentralized exchange like BTS get more volume and list a huge amount of coins, I will still have to deal with this risk unless I decided to quit trading. Almost forgot to mention at the same time I do mining coin too, and that is writing on Steemit by proof of brain. Most beneficial mining method ever to earn some cash while actively preventing dementia. How do you manage your profile? 加密货币已经变成了我最大的投资板块，因为我自认是个激进型的投机投资玩家。在日渐壮大的持有账户下，我有一套管理货币的方案。 稳定部分 这里占了总账面的四成价值。稳定的意思是所有在这分类的币种都属于长期持有。它们全部都存放在私人钱包里。Trezor 和 Ledger 有支持的都被优先选择比如 BTC LTC ETH，没有被硬件钱包支持的都各自放在桌面钱包上比如 ADA BTS IOTA 等。 与此同时我还搞了张电子表格记录所有的长线币种。所有进入私人钱包的币种都会上榜。这一站式的工具对追踪数量，成本和表现有很大的帮助，一打开表格就一目了然。强烈建议所有投资人也应该这样做，对定期的账面总结和反思调整绝对是必备利器。 成长部分 在加密货币的账面里，所有币种就应该用 BTC 来衡量其价值。而持有 1 BTC 尽管从 $1,000 升值到 $15,000，也依然是 1 BTC。成长在这里就是以 BTC 为单位来增加价值。 这里占了我所有币价值的六成。它们主要是流通在各大交易所上进行频密的山寨币短线交易，小部分用于投资有前景的 ICO。所以这类别下的所有资金不是在集中式的平台上就是在 ICO 的发展团队手上。目前这种情况我内心深处其实也是很恐慌的，毕竟*永远不要把币存放在交易所上。无可奈何，除非我不想交易了，又或者是像 BTS 这样的分散式交易所开始成为主流。 差点忘了说我同时也在挖矿增加账面价值，那就是用脑力在 Steemit 上挖矿。目前最佳的挖矿方式，赚钱的同时还可以预防老人痴呆症。 你又有什么管理方法呢？ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘How do I manage my crypto portfolio 币的管理’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/how-do-i-manage-my-crypto-portfolio/"},{"title":"My story to say goodbye to iOS 苹果拜拜","text":"Starting from the Symbian OS from Nokia phone, the first smartphone was the LG Nexus 4. I had a really hard time choosing which Android phone I should go and my Android fanboy friend said that I should really give Nexus series phone a try. Running stock Android like how the should be running without bloatware, ultra smooth, incomparably lightweight. I said why not and that’s how I first got my pure Android experience with the Nexus 4. Why didn’t consider the Apple? Simple because my student pocket was too shallow for a luxury item like that. This applies to why I use Windows all my life without ever considering the Mac. Until I’m capable of having wider choices, always wanted to try the famous iOS product I got myself the iPad and iPhone. Top-notch build quality, stable and smooth UI experience, I was once feeling a sense of privilege everytime I use them. Until some problems clashed with my freedom-based mindset: File sharing with others is a nightmare.No Bluetooth to non-iOS devices and iTunes is such mess that I suspect it was created just to anti-human. Simple task like sharing a photo with my Android peer the best way is to use third party solution like email or cloud-based service like Dropbox. When I connect the device to the Windows PC via iTunes wanted to backup or retrieve something, I scratched my head throughout the whole process every time. And every other time I attempt something with the iTunes, I will have to start like I was a total beginner as those steps are way too complicated to understand. I understand Apple wants to force the fan to build Apple ecosystem in their environment. I guess having a full set of iCloud, iPhone, iPad, MacBook could make one’s life really easy. But too bad I’m not a believer in such fanboy fantasy. File sharing is just a big pain in the arse for iOS. Rigid and inflexible system flow.How to activate color invert in iOS and Android? In iOS, Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility&gt;Invert Colors 4 steps. While in Android, pull down the toggle panel from the top bar and press invert color, 2 steps. Or you can even set a shortcut on the homescreen where you can press right away. Maybe you say iOS can do the same using the pull-from-bottom control panel, but that feature is not available until Apple decided to offer it. At least those four steps are what I have to do when I want to have a nice night-reading time inside my bed. Oh yeah, the Night mode isn’t available back then as well. I wished so bad I can customise and tweak those little things to make my life better that I jailbroken both the iPad and iPhone. Only to find out it doesn’t grant more freedom than the unrooted Android. The last straw was when I found out the same music file in an App is not available in the other player App. That I have to download an identical song in every music playing App on my iPhone. I’ve decided this is not my thing and I’ve had enough. Live my life happily after going back to the open arms of Android and I never look back. That’s my firm belief that one should not reject a food without ever trying it. The only thing iPhone impressed me the most was the physical build quality. Stock Android running on an iPhone body could be the best phone in the world. Next, I shall talk more about Android. 简要： 穷苦的从前让我只能选择使用安卓，后来稍微有能力买得起苹果了就果断入手 iPhone 和 iPad 来拉高格调。果然如传说中的一般高上大，一流的硬件设计和过硬的 iOS 系统都让我每一次使用的时候心里的虚荣感不住骚动，知道麻木之后问题开始浮现： 文件分享简直是噩梦遇到最笨的设计就是同一首歌曲居然只能在一款播放器里找得到，别的播放器听的话只能再次下载另一份一模一样的歌曲。那还得了？蓝牙分享只认自己人，还有人类的天敌 – iTunes，这款软件根本就是设计出来让人得忧郁症的。每次一次使用即使是为了重复之前做过的动作，都会让人有种从来没用过的新手感觉。用的当儿真的想叫开发员出来，让拳头们好好的和他们交流交流。 死板的系统流程设计反转颜色这个效果在 iOS 要四个步骤才可以完成，而在安卓只需要两个步骤，甚至可以在主页面设一个快捷键来一键开启功能。结果每天晚上在被窝里就是为了降低光线刺激好好上个网都要不厌其烦的重复繁琐的步骤。别小看那区区四步，对懒人来说那可是很痛苦的。后来为了得到我想要的自由就把设备们都越狱了，却发现得到的自由度还不如还没有 root 的安卓系统。 我主张没吃过的的食物就没资格去说不好吃。这次的经历让我笃定的回到了安卓的怀抱，从此过着幸福快乐的日子。下次再说说安卓吧！ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘My story to say goodbye to iOS 苹果拜拜’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/my-story-to-say-goodbye-to-ios/"},{"title":"Hail the great Android 安卓万岁","text":"After my expression why Apple products is not my cup of tea, let’s talk more about my favorite OS, the almighty Android. Million thanks to the friend that introduced me my first pure Android device, the Nexus 4. Guess that was part of the reason I’m so into open-source idea in everything. Ultimate customization It’s cool for the manufacturer to guess my preference and design the system for me. Really convenient and thoughtful way to delivering a product. But they can’t always be right in everything. That’s why the room of customization is so important here. You are welcome to offer your best designed system to me and it would be great if I can tweak it a little more the way I like. In Android, you own your phone almost 100% top to bottom. Change that battery icon, show internet speed at top bar, decide multiple gesture effect on the screen, customize every single buttons on the phone and a lot more. Genuinely adapting a phone to the master himself. What? Who got the time to waste on stuffs like that? Well, iPhone design for people who don’t value customization that much. In fact, swapping a wallpaper is considered a customization too. Lots of community support.Source Amazing power of community project can already been witnessed from various aspects. For example, innovative ideas could be realised through crowdfund ing platform like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, open-source project repositry site Github has been the best birth bed for cool freewares. Android being one of the largest open-source projects and having probably the most active community, it is capable of generating countless ideas on the improvement and new features for for this mobile operating system. The ability of gathering community intellegence and effort also bring much edgy functions like the split screen and off screen gesture to real application while no other OS capable of doing so. Huge community= Rapid development, more support, great ideas, best execution. 至今仍然很感谢带我进入安卓世界的那位朋友，让我也发现原来自己是那么深爱具有开源特性的项目。继上次讨论过为什么不喜欢苹果的专制化之后，来吹一波安卓的伟大吧！ 客制化就是唯一核心大量的客制化选项是安卓最大的特色之一，从改变电池显示图形到每个物理按钮的实际作用，几乎没有一样东西是不能根据个人喜好而改变的。 当然这不是说用安卓就一定要费尽心思去改制一切，原生出产的设置也可以是很棒的，完全不用改变一草一木也可很好的使用。只是在绝佳的原厂设置之下，再容许用户加上个人调整，最适合自己的绝佳手机不就诞生了吗？ 强大的社区任何开源项目背后都有社区团队在支撑，而安卓身为可能是全球最受欢迎最多人参与的开源项目之一，所产生的力量更是不容小觑的。 安卓通过把集思广益最大化的效应实现了一个又一个站在业界前端技术，从早期的黑屏手势功能到后期的同屏双视窗，具有开创性的点子更是不断的被同行们所借鉴。 强大的社区意味着更高频率的开发，更多技术支持，更完善的执行能力。 当然还有很多场外因素巩固我对安卓的支持，比如众多的竞争产生出来的亲民价格。愿这么棒的操作系统继续蓬勃发展下去！ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Hail the great Android 安卓万岁’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/hail-the-great-android/"},{"title":"Old and new money 银票和比特币","text":"This is the real bank note or you can use it cash in the old China society. Various of handwriting to indicate the value and multiple stamps from the officials to grant authority to this note. When I saw this antique in the muzeum it reminds me so much of how our currency have developed. From bank note like this to the fiat currency, then credit cards and here we are in the burst of cryptocurrency. It is also interesting to see how we moved our trust in the money system. First the people deposit gold or silver into the unincorperated bank and they issue a bank note to act as a bond. And that is a product of trust between the private banks and investor with the value backed by gold inside the vault. Now we are in the trustless system of cryptocurrency where there is no bank in between the users hence, we don’t have to trust anyone. Absolutely an amazing feeling looking at the old bank note that serve no more purpose than just a antique in a muzeum while realizing I have some Bitcoin in my phone which I can spend everywhere. In the next 100 years, will the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency like Bitcoin survive? Not sure, but I’m certain that they wouldn’t be able to stick a Bitcoin on the muzeum wall in 2200. 这是古代的银票，是我在参观青州博物馆时看到的。在上面可以看到手写的各种数字和几个盖章表明着这张银票的权威性和价值。当然现在它们不再是银票，随着时代转变已经变成了博物馆上的文物。 古时候人们都是用金银交易，然后钱庄就出现了。人们只需要把金银存放进去代表了权威的钱庄，钱庄发出张债劵，这就算是中国古社会最早最初的现金雏形。从银票开始，人们经历了现金，信用卡，再到现在的虚拟货币。 这过程中可以很有趣的看到货币系统中的信任转换 。银票可以被使用是因为当时人们信任钱庄真的可以保存对应的金银。然后到现代银行也是一样的道理，我们相信存放进去的钱真的是在里面的，需要的时候银行会如数全给回我们，在太平稳定的国家的确如此。 最后就是无需信任的区块链技术上的虚拟货币登场了，我们正在潮流的前端。 看着这张曾经让许多人趋之若鹜的银票，我想起手机里的虚拟货币，心里不禁感概万千，不知一百年后的比特币会是什么下场。但就算它已经成为历史，我想在 2200 年博物馆的墙上也没办法贴上比特币，毕竟不存在啊，呵呵。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Old and new money 银票和比特币’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/old-and-new-money/"},{"title":"What is your reason to HODL 遇红不惊","text":"In the recent correction, I was surprised by myself that I was way calmer than I thought. During last few big corrections like this with my total investment worth 30% less in a few nights, I can feel my heartbeats was at a higher pace all day. Checking out coinmarketcap.com every 10 seconds. Imaging what to do if all my coins tank to zero. Struggling to execute the ‘buy red’ strategy. But now I’m unbelievably calm. Maybe I starting to become a seasoned trader/speculator/investor in my past 8 months in this space. Maybe I’ve seen enough in this crazy crypto world. To make sure I’m not blindly confident about the future or just goes numb for all the up and down, I have to list out my reason to HODL in such red season. 1. I’ve been through sh*t like thisYes, I bought Bitcoin at $19k right before it went down to $12k and I never sell a single Satoshi. Of course, there were wars in my head but the HODL army finally won. That crash in fact, was way worse than what we are going through now. I have no reason not to stand firm in a small correction wave like this. 2. I’ve seen things comebackAt the beginning of spreading my BTC into various altcoins, my portfolio has been floating around 20%~30% loss for a few months. I was sad but wasn’t desperate enough to cut them all, yet I wasn’t brave enough to continue throwing funds at it. Last month, my profile was at 600% gain. 3. I know the fundamental.I was once the typical dumb money in the market that buys high and sells low, did everything exactly to lose money. Then I started to learn about the fundamental, the technologies behind then prices, the problem these projects are aiming to solve. I manage to put away my faith from the fluctuating price onto something else that is more crucial, the value. 4. “I dare you to drop to zero.”That is my favorite line that I would be mumbling viciously to myself everytime I stare at the red sea of price charts. By saying that I am sending a message to my subconscious mind that I was ready for my portfolio to become zero for real. And this actually helps me to HODL without a second thought. From above, maybe you can tell that I’m an aggressive investor. Or maybe I’m not. One thing for sure, I wanted to be involved in this amazing space, as deep as I can. 最近的熊市，发觉我比从前更冷静了，冷静得自己都不敢相信。 要知道，在最近几次的大熊市时我基本上的症状就是：好几天心跳都维持在比平时高的频率上跳动；每十秒就查看价格表一次；整天问自己要是全部归零如何是好；想要趁低价买入却举棋不定，总之就是随着价格的波动而患得患失。 现在出奇的淡定到底是什么原因呢？难道是看得太多神经变得麻木了？还是我己经慢慢窥得资深投资人的门道了？不管如何，一定要列出几个原因好知道自己不是盲目的自信。 1. 我…已经不是第一次了对，不是第一次看到这样的血海了。看着户口里价格为 12,000 美金的比特币，哥可是用 19,000 把它买回来的哦。当然卖与不卖的各种战役在我心里不知上演过多少次，始终我还是坚持了下来不卖。那么大的风浪都走过来了，这种芝麻绿豆小斜坡是不会让我皱一皱眉头的。 2. 我见证过小币们的复仇记曾经有一度我的投资档案可是一连数个月都是在亏损 20%~30% 的状态。伤心，但不至于绝望到全放手了。上个月春天终于降临，总体上平均回报达到了 600%。 3. 我对币种基础有认识曾经我就是市场里有名的韭菜，买高卖低是我的常规操作。痛定思痛后我开始研究和学习隐藏在价格身后的技术，项目背景和它们所要解决的问题。有了更深的了解之后，之前全押在价格上的信仰就有了更坚强的后盾，价格的波动也不显得那么刺眼了。 4. “有本事就给老子跌成零。”在熊市，这是我看着一片红海时最爱喃喃自语的对白。发狠劲说这样的言语真的会在潜意识里做好一切归零的打算，然后坚持不买的决定更容易维持了。虽然这样的狠劲真的很像赌鬼才会说的话，但是身在币圈，谁不是在赌？ 我基本上就是靠着以上这几条原则**遇红不惊**，你又有什么心得呢？ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘What is your reason to HODL 遇红不惊’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/what-is-your-reason-to-hodl/"},{"title":"Thrilling moment in BTS 比特股的惊悚时刻","text":"Bitshares has an amazing feature that allows users to borrow funds from the network using your BTS as collateral. I have some small investment in BTS for quite some time and I thought that would be a good idea to borrow some cash out of it. The only risk is that if the real-time feed price drops lower than my call price, my collateral BTS will be seized. In layman words, if the price of BTS drops below my designated price my collateral will be paid to the network for my loan. “The BTS is strong and I believe in it so much! Why not making use of the feeless loan to make some cash?” Yeah, that’s what I was thinking and I decided to borrow USD100 with 1.87 collateral ratio with is 392.425 BTS as a guarantee. The feed price at that time was 0.87 USD/BTS and my call price was 0.44 USD/BTS. Meaning if the BTS drop from 0.87 all the way to below 0.44, my 392.425 BTS would be gone for the sake of USD 100 that I borrowed. And shit happened. Waking up this morning BTS dropped to hard it almost touches my call price at 0.44 USD. With the chill running down my spines I have to do something to save my collateral. Open the https://openledger.io/market/BTS_USD, click on the borrow USD. This would recall the page that shows my last collateral information. My security is on the cliff. I would have to lower the risk of being seized by increasing collateral or collateral ratio. Simply pull the collateral ratio bar to the right and you will see the call price is being adjusted to lower price. Now I have lowered my call price to 0.30 USD/BTS with 2.70 ratios. And I have 566 BTS at the stake now already. The BTS has to drop below this line to claim my collateral. Input password to confirm the operation. Done. Totally not fun to play with the loan in such a red season. The feature is nice but you will need a big heart to make use of it. Hope BTS could sustain a little longer and would never cross my bottom line of defense. HODL! 比特股有个很多人不知道的好康头，其中之一就是可以免利息的借贷款，条件是用手上的 BTS 作为抵押金。出于对比特股和 Dan 这个天才的看好，这一阵子其实我手头上慢慢也存了一点比特股，却也是摆在钱包里不闻不问，之前看到 O 神 @oflyhigh 介绍借贷的玩法也没行动，但是已经记在心里。 前几天空闲时就行动起来了，主要是觉得 BTS 价格稳步上升很不错，失去抵押金的风险应该不大，就用了 392.425 BTS 作为押金借出了 100 美金。当时候的价格是 0.87 美金 而我的强平触发价是 0.44，简单来说就是比特股要是跌破 0.44 美金我的 392.425 BTS 就一江春水向东流，永不再见了。这是腰斩的状态也，可能性不高吧，当时我是这么觉得的。 然后今早起来就这样了。 我的 392.425 BTS 已经在悬崖上摇摇欲坠，身姿估计不会太美妙。不行，我不能让它就这样爆仓！ 赶紧登录 https://openledger.io/market/BTS_USD 点开借贷界面再加码 173.81 BTS 把爆仓价降低至 0.30 USD/BTS。总算是暂时稳住了。 要是再继续跌，我就等于用共计 566 BTS 换了 USD 100，算起当初的买入价，血本无归啊！心情好复杂。希望尽快低谷反弹，宝宝知错了。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Thrilling moment in BTS 比特股的惊悚时刻’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/thrilling-moment-in-bts/"},{"title":"Bitcoin is not a currency! 比特币不是钱！","text":"Yesterday I was talking about the hardware wallet investment with my friend. The first one we bought was the legendary Trezor and I shared with them that was my first and only time purchasing something with Bitcoin. Then I felt something is not right, purchase time should be at half a year ago when Bitcoin price is not this high yet. Quickly search through my inbox to make sure how much I’ve paid for the wallets. Holy shit, 0.1197 BTC for a Trezor multipack! That was priced at USD 286 at that moment including shipping. And 0.11 BTC is around USD 1631 now. In less than 8 months I’ve lost USD 1345 over a purchase. All because there was an option to pay with Bitcoin when I checkout my order, and I thought that was a good idea to actually purchase something with the virtual currency. Real application right? Since then, I make sure I spend my fiat and keep every bit of my cryptocurrencies. Paid my next bitcoin-acceptable purchase of second wallet Ledger via Visa gladly, never mind the processing fee they charging on me(talking about fee, Bitcoin have the worst fee now). So the moral of this story is, people don’t like to spend what tends to rise in value, they rather treat it as an investment. Bitcoin is now very much become a store of value instead of what it initially wanted to be as a digital currency. If you have faith in the cryptocurrencies that you hold, try not to spend it just for the sake of feeling useful. Or you spend it and never look back like the buyer of the 10,000 BTC pizza. 昨天和朋友谈起硬体钱包的事宜，当初刚进入币圈的时候知道这钱包的好处，就联合几个志同道合的朋友入手了一个 Trezor。Trezor 是接受比特币付款的，出于好奇心，那也是我第一次也是唯一一次使用比特币购买东西。 谈着谈着忽然觉得有什么不对劲，购买钱包的时候已经大半年以前了，那时比特币还远远没现在这样值钱啊，赶紧打开邮箱查看当时到底付了多少。 （看图二） 我的妈，一套三件的 Trezor 配套总值 286 美金我当时居然给了 0.1197 BTC ！转换成美金即是 1631 元。这就是说，八个月前的一次购物，到现在足足亏损了 1345 美金。一切都是因为当时一颗想使用比特币的心，用比特币买东西好棒棒哦不是吗？ 从此以后，我确保可以用现金的时候尽量不用比特币了。在上次购买第二个也接受比特币付款的 Ledger 钱包时也使用了 Visa，传统的高手续费我也付得心甘情愿（话说现在应该没什么手续费是高得过比特币，唉）。 这个故事里我们学到，人们不会喜欢把有升值潜力的东西当作现金花掉，这也是为什么比特币与其成为它本来想成为的货币，到现在却成了保值品。 如果你对现在持有的加密货币有信心，尽量继续持有它们别花掉吧。又或者是毅然把它们花了然后永远不回头看，就像那花了 10,000 比特币买比萨饼的仁兄。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Bitcoin is not a currency! 比特币不是钱！’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/bitcoin-is-not-a-currency/"},{"title":"Crypto January sales 大促销","text":"Thi is a picture from my Telegram signal group and they said the market used to crash every mid-term of January, according to the chart history this is quite true.

Let’s have a quick view of the aftermath in the subreddit which consists of 5k members: Guy got so distressed looking the crashing price on his monitor, his mother entered the room to serve some chicken nuggets, only to get a hysterical scream in the face and plate got hit out of her hand. Unemployed husband bet all his family saving on Bitconnect and lost all the $80k. Have no idea how to face his wife when she’s backed to home. Totally no idea how he should proceed to take care of his family with two sons. Man invested $500k in the scammy game with the help of a business loan, which he planned to withdraw in a month or two, but turned out to be a completely failed speculation. A bloody Suicide Hotline thread was the top pinned post of the day. Guess the operators at the other end will have to deal with the flooding incoming calls.

Somebody just has to learn their lessons the hard way. 想必大家都知道币圈第一大庞氏骗局 Bitconnect 倒台的消息了，一夜之间 400 掉到 20。当下听到的时候，心想这终于来临了。所有币种在 Reddit 都各自自己的圈子，不少还活跃的很，马上就去拜访了 r/Bitconnect，果然哀鸿遍野，整个圈子一片刚刚战败被屠城的样子： 有人盯着电脑屏幕上的价格懵了，他妈妈进房拿鸡块给他吃，却被他歇斯底里吼一脸，手上的碟子还被打翻了。结果底下有个很搞笑的留言，叫他最好把鸡块捡起来了，毕竟鸡块们都比他手上的 BCC 值钱。 无业的丈夫把八万美金的家庭基金全押在这骗局上了，现在不知如何向快回家的妻子交代。下面还有嗷嗷待脯的两个儿子要养。 还有一位勇者把商业贷款借来的五十万刀一把 show hand，结果真的输到只剩 hand。原本打算只玩一两个月就收手，现在收得回来的就真的只有手。 在关于“经济投资”的 Reddit 社区上，当天置顶的帖子居然是防止自杀协会的热线。这可不是说笑的，一时之间我恍如身置虚幻的炼狱之中，估计接线生们可有得忙了。 之后管理员甚至把社区设成了私人领域，没有许可不得入内拜访。我猜这是为了过滤那些忽然涌来看热闹的吃瓜群众，比如在下。 现在又重新开放了&gt; subreddit 真的是大开眼界，世界无奇不有。一个人是要多愚昧才会把全副身家都押在单一投资项目上，更别说是风险极大的加密货币，更更别说是 T*D 的 Bitconnect 骗局了。有些人真的要吃些血一般的教训才会生性。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Aftermath of Bitconnect 骗局后的废墟’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/aftermath-of-bitconnect/"},{"title":"Smile Challenge","text":"有幸被美女 @irisz 提名参加这么个可爱的活动。去看了看这个标签下的帖子，居然是妹子居多，我一个男人老狗来参加好像有点唐突。但还是不管了，有时还是应该参加一下这样的社交活动。 最近币市狂泻不止，红海一遍已经看得麻木了。在这样的日子里，难道微笑不是最好的应对之法？ 在这提名我可爱的爽妹妹 @jessie901220 和好哥们 @we1even。 Smiling is the best way to deal with bear market like this.

Same thing happened to all cryptocurrency-based Visa card like Bitwala, Cryptopay, and Wirex. For those who have no idea what these cards do, they enable users to make payment using their cryptocurrency via Visa tunnel. Visa decided that cryptocurrency is not a valid payment system and that’s the reason they called off the partnership. To me this is not surprising at all. Traditional payment system like Visa and Mastercard should be one of the biggest victims if cryptocurrency is widely adopted one day. That means people will leave centralised authority to start point to point payment. Having no clients for Visa to charge their blood-sucking fee, it is doomsday for them. It’s great that Visa was once be so supportive to cryptocurrency and by using card like Tenx people found it was the mainstream way to make real use of their digital coins. May be as time went by crypto market has been soaring and Visa started to realise they might be in danger. After the service shutdown, users will now have to find a new way to spend in the new currency. However, as long as we need to convert into fiat first in order to spend crypto, problems as such will keep arising over and over. We need a world where buyer and seller only talk in cryptocurrency without fiat at all, and that we called real adoption.

Her teacher doesn’t like the idea of Bitcoin and I thought it was about the crazy pricing. Actually, I kind of agree with him because the price is absolutely volatile which can be affected by unlimited factors. But obviously he wasn’t referring to the price according to the commented he has left as such: “People are crazy taking part in this Bitcoin things The Internet is not safe at all for such activity. How can one assure the security of their virtual asset that floating on Internet They should keep themselves away from it.” I’m sure he has no idea the technology behind the Bitcoin, what Bitcoin was trying to solve and what in future it can offers. I would like to briefly answer to those doubts which I think most people usually have: Is Bitcoin safe?From the point of technical, it is safer than your national bank account. It is widely decentralized without the single point of failure like the bank. No matter how assuring a bank and a country, they can be collapsed and everything tied to them will be diminished, like the currency and your saving account in the bank. Look at Greece for case study if you are interested. Bitcoin powered by blockchain however, is censorship-resistant, open and permanent. No one can reverse a completed transaction or deny your position in the network. Everyone is equal in the space, and your coin in the network is going nowhere. Good, but what security concern should I take with my coins?Though your coins in the network are going to exist forever, the ownership can keep on changing. That means A can send X amount of coins to B, with or without the acknowledgment of the original owner. In the latter case, we call that stealing/hacking. There is no middleman in the crypto world, there is no one to help with your stolen coins. You are your own bank and you owe yourselves a huge self-education class about security. From the difference of hot and cold wallets, relationship between private and public key, to the basic transaction operation. That’s too much for me, what if I don’t care about it?You have to know what you are doing, or you are good to go if you are ready to lose whatever you’ve invested. Is now the good time to buy Bitcoin/will the price go up/down?Take my word, no one can ever have an answer to these questions. If you tell me the price can crash to 0$ or shoot up to $100,000 tomorrow, I would say “Why not?”. Regarding the crypto price, my motto is “No one knows a sh*t.“ All in all, knowing an ignorant networking teacher who is not interested in such disruptive technology that is definitely changing the world made me feel uneasy. But that’s OK since that’s the normal reaction of majority to any new world-changing technology. Glad I’m not one of them.

Base on my active trading experience I quickly sold half of it to secure my capital as I know this kind of sudden surge usually won’t last long. At the same time, I was really curious what makes this coin to be so bullish in the bearish market and decide to check it out, and I glad I did. Ended up not only I bought back the coins I sold a few hours ago, I make this coin into my long-term HODL list as well. What this project is all about? The project is called Cindicator, meaning “Crowd indicator”. In short, Cindicator provides a platform to collect analysts prediction, enhance the data using Artificial Intelligence algorithm and produce valuable indicator for future events. These future events include cryptocurrency price of certain coins and traditional markets like stock and fiat currency trend. Cindicator aims to maximize the “Wisdom of the crowd” in the trading world. Why I’m so bullish on this project?Cindicator gave me the exact same feeling when I first got to know Steem blockchain. Applicable to most people, easy to get involved in and still in early stage of development with hugely undervalued price. One of the very significant point to make this project outstanding is, they already have a working product! Just like the day when Steem was traded below $1, we already have the busiest traffic in crypto space. How to take part in Cindicator? 1) Download the mobile apps or access via website, create an account using an email address. Web app: https://app.cindicator.com/IOS app: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cindicator-earn-money-by-predicting/id1050619919Android app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cindicator 2) Start to make your forecast on various questions ranging from different markets. Questions will have a countdown timer before expired. 3) At the end of each period, a reward pool will be split among the forecaster. The more accurate your forecast, the more reward you can reap from the pool. Currently, the prize is 1 BTC and $6000 to be given out in 9 days. Not bad at all! This very much works like the proof of brain mechanism by Steem. You forecast base on the output of your brainpower. Of course, you can simply try your luck by just simply giving random forecast. But low accuracy will give you low rating and you won’t be rewarded much in the end. Similarly, you can’t land on big votes by posting low-quality post on Steem right? What if I have no talent/interest in forecasting?Well most of us don’t as well, but you still in the game! After the apps collecting all the forecasts and expire that certain question, the data would then be processed and enhanced by Cindicator’s AI/Machine Learning(ML) algorithms and publish that final indicator to the users via Cindicator Bot. However, to access those trading indicators for crypto and fiat assets, one has to possess certain amount of CND tokens. For instance, the Beginner level requires 5,000 CND (possession amount) to receive community choice indicators, market events probability indicators and so on. So far they have produced total 878 indicators and the accuracy is 72.78%, I would say that is impressing! Now you can trade following the signals with great confidence. Personally I have no experience in using this bot, I will try to get my hand on it fast and share the review here soon. Cindicator is best for people who… Love to analyze future prices and events in Crypto, Futures, Stocks, ETF, Commodities, and Currencies. Love to trade with the aid of valuable indicators. Witness the wisdom of the crowd. Looking for projects with great growth potential. VerdictOn the price perspective alone, this project has already bring me 3x return so far but I plan to hold it for longer term. Being a project just a few months old, Cindicator already proved to the investors that they are serious in the business. Simple yet informative site, bloody sleek mobile application, attracting business model, deliver on time according to roadmap. Every element that a project need to be successful in the competitive crypto race. Til next time! Official site: https://cindicator.com/ This is not a financial opinion. Cindicator 是一个误打误撞下让我认识的项目。我一向来拥有根据某个 Telegram 群组的信号买卖货币，前几天发现手上这个叫 CND 的东西忽然上升 100%。经验告诉我这样的事情不会持久，就急急卖了。而后有很好奇这到底是何方神圣，结果了解了一个小时之后我就立马把刚放手的货币全部再买回来了。破例的把短线变成长线持有。 这个项目到底是做什么的？Cindicator 提供了一个平台让大众对各个加密货币或是法币或是股票等的分析，猜测未来某个时间的价位和事件。之后再用自家的人工智慧处理信息，从而生产有品质的信号（indicator）。 简单来说，Cindicator 利用了大众的智慧和人工智慧把预测这块领域的效能放到最大。 为什么我对这项目如此有信心？Cindicator 和 Steem 一样是少数让我发现已经有行得通的产品的同时，价格还维持在很便宜的阶段的。它也拥有和 Steem 一样的特质，大多数人都可以参与，参与难度小，功能使用，和已经拥有可以发挥功效的平台。这可是很难得的！ 如何参与 Cindicator？1）下载手机app 或是拜访网站，用电邮就可以注册户口。2）立刻就可以开始对自己感兴趣的问题进行预测。3）每过一段时间就会根据你的成绩分红，预测越准分红越多。目前是九天后又 1 BTC 和六千刀的奖金将会发放。 某种程度上很像 Steem 的 Proof of Brain 机制。你花费脑力和知识提供预测，然后得到分红。当然，你也也可以胡猜一通，那么你的 rating 想必也不会有多高。就比如你在 Steem 老是发水帖，可以有什么前途？ 我对预测分析没有天赋/兴趣，没戏了？当然不是！其实应该不多人对这种经济分析有兴趣，但是没关系，还有另一大玩法。 之前不是说了会收集大众的信息结果和用人工智慧进行处理，但是所生产出来的结果去哪了呢？答案就是 Cindicator Bot. 这个机器人会通过 Telegram 把处理好的信号公布出来。只是，你必须要持有一定数量的 CND 才可以看到。 以最低的 Beginner 等级为例，你必须要有 5000 CND 才可以看到 community choice indicators 和 market events probability indicators 等对于交易有帮助的信号。 我个人而言还没真正试过这个机器人，将在下一篇有时间测试了再分享出来。要知道，这个机器人目前为止的准确率可是高达 72.78% 哦！ Cindicator 适合人群是… 对经济分析有兴趣的 经常活跃于交易市场的 想利用大众智慧来发达的 想寻找还有巨大成长空间的项目 最后对我个人而言，我对这平台处理出来的信号更有兴趣，当然现在偶尔还是会根据我对加密货币的了解进行预测。我想 @htliao 和 @linuslee0216 这样的投资大家应该会在这平台可以大展拳脚。 最后，我对此项目的价格是非常看好，短短数个月的项目现在已经拥有了很吸引人的商业模式，简洁有力的网站，还有评价非常高的 app，更重要的是预测的准确率还那么高。这样的强力项目可是很少见的。虽然目前为止它已经为我带来 3x 的收益，我暂时还不会卖掉，作为长线相信今年一定会一鸣惊人！ 此篇不是投资建议 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Cindicator, another undervalued and strong project like old day’’s Steem 发现黑马’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/cindicator-another-undervalued-and-strong-project-like-old-day-s-steem/"},{"title":"Transfer ERC20 tokens from exchange to MyEtherWallet via Trezor","text":"Image from myetherwallet What Will I Learn? How to add custom token in MyEtherWallet(MEW). How to transfer ERC20 tokens from exchange to MEW via Trezor. Recently I plan to hold Cindicator(CND) for long-term and an exchange is never a good place to hold your coins. I have a Trezor hardware wallet with a MEW tied to it, by using this combination I can secure my coin safety at maximum level. Hence, we will use CND token (one of the ERC20 tokens) to demonstrate the depositing process. Requirements You have a MEW created. You have some ERC20 tokens to play with. You have a Trezor. OS: Windows 7Browser: Google Chrome DifficultyBasic Tutorial Contents 1) Connect Trezor to your PC. Open https://wallet.trezor.io/ and unlock the wallet. Select Ethereum from the top left drop-down menu. 2) Select TREZOR in the access list and select Connect to TREZOR. You can access the wallet according to your personal setup method, we will stick to Trezor in this method. 3) Select the correct HD derivation path and you will see several addresses being listed in the bottom part. Simply choose any address you would send custom tokens to. In this case, I stick to my original ETH address. Press on Unlock your wallet. 4) Inside the wallet you will able to view your ETH balance and public address. A ERC20 token list is located at the right bottom part Token Balances. 5) First we have to add CND token to the list as it doesn’t host it originally. Click on ‘Add Custom Token’. 6) Fill in all the 3 fields. Put 0xd4c435F5B09F855C3317c8524Cb1F586E42795fa in Token Contract Address. Refer to etherscan.io to verify the official contract address if in doubt, you can use this site to determine any other ERC20 token’s contract address as well. Put CND into Token Symbol and 18 into Decimals. Save it. 7) Click on the Show All Tokens you will see the newly added CND tokens with zero balance. Click on the minus button beside it to remove if you want to, but the fund attaches to this address will still remain in the network. You can add it back anytime by redoing previous step. 8) Go to the exchange where you want to withdraw CND from. In my case it is Binance. Put your ETH address in the CND Withdrawal Address as all the ERC20 tokens are using ETH address to receive transaction. Transfer any amount and click Submit. Tips: It is always a good habit to send the minimum amount to newly generated address just to make sure things are fine. For CND, the minimum sending amount is 400. 9) Wait for a few minutes, the transfer speed depends on the network traffic as well. Check the status of your transaction using https://etherscan.io by providing Transaction ID/Txid. As the transaction is confirmed, you should now see them appear in the custom token list in your MEW. Summary Do not store coins on exchange where you don’t own the private key. Use hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger to host your MEW seed for maximum security. All ERC20 tokens using the ETH address as receiving address. Send minimum amount to try if the new destination wallet is working without problem.

Currently, there is two way to get you hand on the EOS tokens: buy them straight from the exchanges with the market price, or participate in the EOS Token Distribution. The first method is pretty straightforward like how you trading just for any cryptocurrency pair available on an exchange. Topup your account with the mainstream BTC or ETC, and trade with market orders with the desired price. The second method, however, is a bit tricky and interesting. EOS Token Distribution is now at the phase that 2,000,000 EOS will be distributed every day. People can contribute ETH to the crowdfunding address and the two millions of EOS will be distributed equally base to the total contribution of that period. With that said, the more contribution the less EOS participant can get, EOS is more expensive here. On the other hand, if we get a lesser contribution, each investor can get more EOS from the fixed amount distribution. Cheaper EOS. The tricky part is, the contribution is real-time so no one can tell what the final total contribution will be. Things suddenly become quite a bit of gambling, and I decided to give it a try. Let’s do it! In this gambleexperiment, I sent 1 Ether to the EOS crowdsale address. Thing was smooth, network was low in traffic, transaction was done within minutes. Then I start to monitor the real-time collected contribution using two useful sites. The first is the official EOS site and the second is a really useful third-party site, EOSscan.io. EOSscan provides real-time calculation of the EOS token price based on the contributed ETH. Official EOS site EOSscan.io As you can see, so far there is 7920 ETH collected and we are looking at $5.30 for a piece of EOS. Current market price for EOS on the exchanges is about $13. And we have less than two hours to close the deal. Time is ticking, I knew the ETH will keep coming in. But so far everything looks good and I already starts to think about what to do with my cheap EOS later. Yay! And things escalate quickly Within two hours, total collected ETH has come to 23,566. This made the price of EOS token soared up to almost $16. Damn, my heart was just bleeding non-stop. After the distribution period is done, I proceeded to register my ETH address and claim the EOS token. How much in total did I get in the end? I got 80.91 EOS from the daily ICO with each token priced at $16 while the open market is trading at $12.40 according to coinmarketcap.com. My EOS is almost $4 more expensive from the others. Such a tragedy right? Let’s see it in the real world perspective. Let’s do some quick calculationWhat if I choose to spend 1 Ether to buy EOS at Binance? How much could I get? Let’s get the live feed price at Binance using EOS/ETH pair at 22:00 UTC+8 time which is the ending time of EOS token distribution for Period 215. It was trading at 0.0129 EOS/ETH. 1/0.0129 = I will get 77.519379845 EOS by trading 1 Ether neglecting minor fees. To calculate the value of each EOS in fiat, 1 Ether cost $950 at that time and the formula will be 950/77.519379845 = $12.26 Pretty close to the price at coinmarketcap.com which was $12.40. Now what is the fiat price for EOS token I got from the ICO? 950/80.910557854999802311 = $11.74 Conclusion 1 Ether at open exchange can buy 77.51 EOS while EOS ICO can get you 80.91 EOS. EOS token in ICO Period 215 costs $11.74 yet in Binance it would cost $12.26. I got extra 3.4 EOS via ICO which is equivalent to $43. ICO is the more profitable way to get EOS than trading in the open market. Disclaimer: Conclusion is based on the comparison at the mentioned specific time only. Performance may vary. Luck is playing a big factor here. 昨晚心血来潮想入手一些 EOS。目前入手的方法有两种，一就是直接在自由市场比如 Binance 上进行交易。第二种就比较刺激有趣了，那就是参加为期一年的 EOS ICO。现在每天都有二百万的 EOS 会被发放，每个时段投资者得到多少取决于当个时段所筹到的 ETH 总数。 换言之，筹到的 ETH 越多每人可以得到的 EOS 越少，单个 EOS 的价格相对就越高。没人会知道最后会筹到多少钱，所以相比可以在市场上用明价买卖的方式，这个每天都有的 ICO 会更有赌博性质。我决定试一试。 最后得到的结论为： 1 ETH 在 Binance 可以买到 77.51 EOS，而通过 ICO 可以得到 80.91 EOS。 ICO 得到的 EOS 单价为 $11.74 而 Binance 上需要花费 $12.26。 通过 ICO 我多赚了 3.4 EOS，等价为 $43。 EOS ICO 比自由市场交易更为划算。 声明：这个结果只是基于特定的 ICO 时段（Period 215）和当下市场情况，不能一概而论。运气还是占了很大的部分。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Which way is more profitable in getting EOS, trading or ICO? 众筹和交易哪个可以得到更多 EOS’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/which-way-is-more-profitable-in-getting-eos-trading-or-ico-eos/"},{"title":"Use Cindicator Bot to access the wisdom of crowd 用机器人展现大众的智慧","text":"In my long-term hold of Cindicator hoping it could rise to the moon, I also want to make sure I take full advantage what this project offers. In the previous chapter, I shared that you can take part in forecasting and win prizes depends on your prediction’s accuracy. Today I would present you another main feature, the Cindicator Bot 1.0. Cindicatorbot - a telegram bot which sends hybrid intelligence empowered indicators for traditional and crypto financial markets. Depending on your possession of CND tokens, you can access different level of indicators as follows: Beginner &gt;5000 CNDCrypto: Community choice, Event probability indicators;Traditional: Event probability indicators Trader &gt;200 000 CNDAll Beginners indicators plus:Crypto: Weekly support and resistance indicators, ICO ranking v.0.9 beta;Traditional: Weekly support and resistance indicators Expert &gt;700 000 CNDAll Trader indicators plus:Crypto: Price level indicators;Traditional: Price level indicators I personally hold 5k of CND to unlock the Beginner level, can’t wait to setup and see what can I get from the bot. According to the record, their processed indicators on future events like price level and event probability were averaging at 80%. That is enough for me to call that high-accuracy indicator. Register your ETH address holds CND using this guide. The process is mainly handled using Telegram as the Cindicator Bot is built on that. Most important step is to send a 0 amount transaction to verify your address. Done, I’ve got 5274 CND and able to access Beginner plan Several options will be availble to play with after the verification. Community choice At the Beginner plan, community choice is one of the two features I entitled to. Every week we can vote for the listed option of different cryptocurrency. The highest voted crypto will be forecasted in the Cindicator app where the analysts and AI would take place to produce an indicator. I chose STORJ for the next forecast topic, but if any other crypto assets won the race I wouldn’t mind too. Market events probabilityThere are two market events probability currenctly under forecasting. Select the first event, displays the forecast questions. This forecast is about to find out the cryptocurrency total market cap by February 28 which is think is really important for all the investor to be aware of. Personally, I don’t think the chance for the market to fall below USD 400B is likely, but I would like to know how the people think about it too. Now we start to see the practical usage to Cindicator in collecting the wisdom of the crowd. The result isn’t published yet since forecasting and processing about the event are still undergoing in the Cindicator app. By UTC 14:00 the processed indicator will be published and I shall share with you again in the next post. SummaryThough active trader like me could make great use of the Crypto price level indicators in Export plan, access to the plan itself requires 700,000 CND which is equivalent to almost USD 200k and that is way beyond my entire crypto profile already. But we will see how the Beginner plan can benefit me. Setting up Cindicator Bot is easy as a breeze. 5,000 CND can access the Beginner plan only. Limited indicators available in Beginner plan. Previous posts about Cindicator:Cindicator #1 - Cindicator, another undervalued and strong project like old day’s Steem 在长期持有 Cindicator 除了期待它会一飞冲天让我从此自由自在之外，我们也应该好好利用它所带来的各种功能。 那就是上次提到的 Cindicator Bot 1.0。这个机器人简单来说，会把处理好的市场预测信号发放给持有者。 而不同的持有数量可以解锁不同的配套，所可以收到的信息也越来越高级。 Beginner &gt;5000 CNDTrader &gt;200 000 CNDExpert &gt;700 000 CND 我刚好拥有 5k CND 可以解锁 Beginner 配套。那就看看里头有什么有用的吧。通过这篇教程把持有 CND 的 ETH 地址注册到网路中，这过程主要使用 Telegram 来进行。据我所知 Telegram 在大陆似乎需要翻墙才可以使用，所以大陆用家会有点不方便。 设置好了之后聊天室会出现几个选项，在初级配套我们主要可以使用两种功能而已。 第一个就是 Community choice。社区在几个加密货币之间投票，得票最高的将会被选作为下期预测的对象。我选择了 STORJ，但是别的货币赢了也无所谓，我还是会得到预测结果产生的信号。 第二个是 Market events probability，也就是不针对某个货币而言的市场现象预测。现在有两个题目正在进行预测。其中一个我挺感兴趣的，那就是二月二十八之前加密货币总市值会不会跌破 400B ？ 个人看来是不看好会发生的，但是听一听大众的预测又何妨？这就是 Cindicator 的有用之处，有效的集合利用大众的智慧。目前还没结果，有结果了我会再和大家分享。 结论 设置 Cindicator 机器人很简单容易。 5,000 CND 只能解锁初级配套。 初级配套并没有太多产品可以使用，但是表现还不好评估。 Discord ID: fr3eze#8617 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Use Cindicator Bot to access the wisdom of crowd 用机器人展现大众的智慧’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/use-cindicator-bot-to-access-the-wisdom-of-crowd/"},{"title":"Crypto market cap fall below 400B in Feb? 二月大泄？","text":"Finally, I received my first indicator from Cindicator Bot, and the expectation from the crowd is not so enlightening. As the indicator suggests, total market capitalization is 65% likely to fall below 400B at any time before Feb 28. What is it like to fall that hard? Currently, we are at 550B according to coinmarketcap.com, that would be at least a steep 33% crash despite the market hasn’t really recovered from the 800B to 500B correction. Bitcoin could easily drop below $8000 with the same market dominance. Oh, I would suspect if I was dreaming to see Bitcoin that cheap again after so long. From both emotional and rational perspective, I do not wish this to happen as I already bought the dip in this correction. Maybe I should change the strategy a little according to this scary indicator, after all they are having 72% accuracy by far. Why not? Previous posts about Cindicator:Cindicator #1 - Cindicator, another undervalued and strong project like old day’s SteemCindicator #2 - Cindicator Bot introduction 前天终于迎来了第一个市场信号，该问题如下 加密货币总市值在二月二十八之前，有没有可能在任何一个时间点跌破 4000 亿美金？ 而大众给出来的预测居然是 65% 的概率会发生。 跌破 4000 亿是怎样的概念？ 以目前总市值 5500 亿而言，那会是个至少 33% 的大跌幅，而且还是在目前市场还没从上次的调整恢复过来的基础上。比特币以目前 34% 的市场占有率，那就是会跌破 $8000 大关。如果成真我一定会以为自己在做梦，毕竟上次看到这么平廉的价格可是上个世纪的事了。 从理性和感性的角度出发我都不希望这会成真，毕竟在这次调整已经把仅有的现金 Buy the dip 了。但基于 Cindicator 72% 的预测准确率，或许调整策略也是不错的选择。 Discord ID: fr3eze#8617 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Crypto market cap fall below 400B in Feb? 二月大泄？’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/crypto-market-cap-fall-below-400b-in-feb/"},{"title":"Trezor cannot claim Bitcoin Gold with its Claim Tool","text":"Expected behaviorTrezor should show me the BTG amount that I can claim using the tool.

The first advice I gave to friends who are going to start their journey in Steem is to ignore the money. I know I used money as the main point to sell the idea of Steem to them, but they really have to ignore the return part in the beginning phase. I’ve been there. I know being a total plankton you will get way less payout than you expected no matter how much effort you’ve put in that article. And comparing the money to the whale’s post could be the last straw to give up Steem forever. But are you even in the position to start the comparison? We often envy of the tremendous wealth that people made with the early investment of Bitcoin. The fact is, they deserve the handsome return for every reason. They spent time to detect the presence of Bitcoin and put effort into studying it, while you were partying hard in the clubs. They dared to risk their capital to something that everyone sneered at, while you thought “better play safe with the bank’s fixed deposit‘. They have the determination to hold it through several crashes, while you were cheering that you didn’t step into that obvious trap. And they got the biggest smile at the end than most of us. Same applies to the world of Steem. Stop staring at the whale’s payout with the greened eye. If you have to, I would suggest that you spend some time to dig out their earliest posts, bet they did worse than what you’ve achieved now. Most of the new generation joined Steem in the flowering season, witnessed it raised from $1 to $6. But would you stay if the all-time-high price of $3.5 has dropped to just $0.15? Those whales did. They deserve every bit of their reward now. So stop comparing and start focus on our own instead. Start putting the focus on something you can control rather than complaining other’s payout. Believe me, you have more problems to deal with on this platform. Is your article typesetting good enough for a comfortable reading? Do you know how to set an attractive title? What is the most effective way to promote your posts? How can you do more to contribute to the community? Envy will bring you nowhere but stuck on the same ground. When people were busy grumping at missing the 2009 Bitcoin lottery, some wise people who keep their eyes opened found the STEEM gem in 2016. Move on!

Commenting is authoring or curating?First of all, you can find the comments payout under Author reward. This makes perfect sense to me as when we are typing a comment, we are essentially expressing our thoughts just like authoring a new post. For an informative and insightful comment, sometimes it could be longer than a post. So it is perfectly fine to take comment under Author reward. Calculation of the reward. The example above, I was receiving 0.240 SBD and 0.040 SP for a comment. From that, it is clearly not 100% SP payout we can conclude that comment’s reward is following the 50/50 payout distribution. How much does commenter take from the comment’s reward?As we know the SP is finalized by the market price of Steem after 7 days, we could ignore the SP and just focus on SBD. In STEEM algorithm, SBD is forever pegged to 1 USD despite how fluctuating the price actually is in the outer market(which is much higher than 1 USD now). Since SBD is 50% in the reward payout, commenter take-home pay percentage is SBD in reward x 2 / Total comment reward. Apply the numbers into the formula, we have 0.240 * 2 / 0.64= 0.75.In this example, I as the commenter took the 75% author reward just like how the post reward works. Let’s try on the other cases With this comment, I got a total payout of $1.03 and the reward distribution is 0.516 SBD and 0.086 SP.With the formula, we got 0.516 * 2 / 1.03 = 1.00. In this case, I as the commenter took 100% of the author reward. You might notice that my reward come from self-voting rather than voted by the others, and this may be the cause of different reward percentage. Let’s continue to have a look at another self-voted comment. Actual reward is $1.12, I got 0.421 SBD and 0.074 SP out of the reward.0.421 * 2 / 1.12= 0.75. I got 75% out of the total reward instead of 100% although this one was self-voted like the previous example. Conclusion Comment’s reward is considered as Author reward. Comment’s reward is not distributed in 100% SP. Commenter gets 75% ~100% out of the total comment’s reward. Reward source (self-voted or voted by others) doesn’t matter in reward distribution. Please enlighten me if I was doing any mistakes here. 出于好奇评论的奖励是如何分配和定制的，在自己的评论奖励中我简单的做了些调查，得出的结论如下： 评论奖励算是作者奖励。 评论奖励是使用 50/50 的分配方式。 评论者得到 75%～100% 的评论奖励。 评论奖励的来源（别人投还是自己投）对奖励的分配不造成影响。 如有错误请不吝赐教。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘How comment’’s reward is distributed? 评论奖励的分配’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/how-comment-s-reward-is-distributed/"},{"title":"Cindicator actually predicted this crash 为什么我不听话","text":"7 days ago, in the post Crypto market cap fall below 400B in Feb?

By the time this indicator was given out the Market Cap was around 550B and I was kind of disappointed with the bot performance.

I have a real complicated feeling towards this situation. A little worried about my investment while truly amazed by the accuracy of the indicator provided by Cindicator bot. Those guys from Cindicator actually forecasted this way before this was showing any sign of happening! At least I couldn’t tell at all a steep crash like this was incoming.

Weak hands already sold their holding in loss and panic while some people said this is all due to whales manipulating market prices by spreading FUD. Although I’m buying the idea of the latter, a couple of real news did impact the market cap like the recent Tether drama. Looking back at 2017, the main theme of bad news has the biggest impact was obvious, government regulation. China ban ICO, South Korea regulate exchanges, India bans cryptocurrency, so on and so on. The market has been dancing to the government decision. Cryptocurrency is meant to be decentralized. Why is the centralized government still able to manipulate the crypto market? Because we need to convert crypto to fiat anyhowAlthough cryptocurrency has gained much attention lately, more and more shops and commercial units start to accept payment in crypto. But it is hard to deny that we are still far away in adopting the crypto in full scale in real life. You can’t buy house property or car using crypto, even if there may be someone will claim this is not true, but one cannot do this without a supportive government and they better be ready to answer the calls from IRA. You still need fiat put food on the table. Fiat is still the only way to buy dinner or snacks from the street vendors or restaurants. Majority treat crypto as an investment asset rather than a currency. Of course, I would love to have the option to pay in Bitcoin. But considering it’s fluctuating characteristic and I’m on the bright side that Bitcoin could gain more in value, I rather not to spend it. Stability is the key for a currency, and the crypto’s fluctuation decides us couldn’t live without fiat at least for the near future. It’s good for them to cut away the bridge of fiat and cryptoTo me, the real adoption is not everyone starting to use crypto as payment or exchange method, but in the end still, need to convert into fiat in order to communicate with the world. In this way, fiat is the base layer and crypto is atop of it. We will get back to the fundamental base somehow. It should be in reversed instead, cryptocurrency should be the base for fiat, everyone communicates to each other in crypto. If a government want to demote crypto all it has to do is shut down the exchanges, this has been effective in chasing people away from taking part in crypto. And it will remain as effective as there is still a demand to convert crypto into fiat. I foresee such need will decrease over time and more people will start to talk purely in crypto. They try to use cash realization as an obstacle in the way of crypto adoption, this will only force us not to use fiat anymore. 币圈的冬季似乎比往常维持更久，相较前几年的“一月冬季”，尤其是昨天总市值更一度跌破 400B 大关。回顾 2017，每一次熊市的主调都离不开“政府”，从中国政府禁止 ICO，南韩实施管制交易所，到印度公开禁止加密货币。伴着政府们每一次的决定，市场都会随之起舞。为什么会这样呢？ 因为不管如何，我们终归需要把手上的币变现。 尽管加密货币在近来确实是越来越火红，也有越来越多商家开始接受虚拟货币的支付方式。但无可否认的是，我们离全面使用货币还有很长的路要走。你不能用币来买房子或车子，也很难买食物来填饱肚子，因为绝大多数小贩餐厅还是只认法币的。当然加密货币本身的特性也使之不能成为货币，价格的不稳定性就是最重要的原因之一。对我来说币与其说拿来用，它们更像是投资产品。当某件持有物具有升值空间时，人们倾向不把它们当货币使用。这也是为什么在短期的未来，我不觉得加密货币可以真正的在支付上流行开来，也解释了为什么我们还是离不开法币。 国家的干预和阻断是好的 如果一个政府当局想要阻止人民参与加密货币，最有效的方法就是对交易所下手。因为人们就没有了购买货币或是变现的管道。然而这个方法只要一天还有变现的需求，一天都会有效。真正的普及化是人人都用加密货币过生活，而完全不再需要换成法币。钱币的建设趋向会是建立在区块链上，包括法币。希望这一天尽快到来。 他们想利用掐死变现通道这方法来干预货币，只会让更多人选择寻找不再变现的方法。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Cryptocurrency will only achieve real adoption without the need of fiat conversion 加密货币的真正普及’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/cryptocurrency-will-only-achieve-real-adoption-without-the-need-of-fiat-conversion/"},{"title":"Andreas M.

Why? Because all the altcoins are at a deep loss as most of them were last traded when the total market cap was at 800B. I’m not panic nor worry about this situation as I knew this could happen prior to doing those trades. All this bear market means to me is that I could take a short break until the market is recovered. And I have a list of altcoins that I believe will have a long-term value, I put them into private wallets and do not trade them at all. They serve as a long-term investment asset to me. Value of that list plunged of course with the market. There is nothing I can do about it other than waiting for the bear out of the market. Steem, however, still providing value to me no matter how the market does I’ve been on this platform for more than 5 months, writing something every day on it has already become part of my routine. Started when Steem was at $1, been to ATH $8, still continue my journey at current $4. No matter how bad is the crypto market now, my investment in Steem keeps generating income non-stop. Everyone still got the free 20% Voting Power to spend, combined with SP, this outputs wealth. I still got curation reward by participating in other’s posts. I still got author reward by creating contents and commenting. My Stemm Power still receiving dividend by Steem inflation. Even better, I got more SP in reward as Steem price went down recently. I believe Time is the best touchstone for a coin’s value. A great coin/project must be able to deliver despite bear or bull market, like a self-sustaining machine. I’m glad that Big bear market like this makes me realized Steem is way more durable and profitable than expected. Keep creating! 已经停止交易货币近一个月了，原因很简单，那就是因为市场这一阵子的大跌把全部货币套住了。我其实是不慌的，这样的情况之前也不是没遇到过，只是这次熊市似乎维持更久。再者，交易之前当然也知道这样的情况一定会发生，所以也不存在 panic sell 的情形，当放个小假等市场回复吧。 在众多我长期持有的货币当中，Steem 在这时就显出威力了。 因为在这样的大熊市，Steem 依然不断的为我创造价值。 每天自动回复的 20% Voting power 再加上 Steem Power 就是源源不绝的财富输出。 我依然从评论和文章中赚取作者奖励。 我依然从从点赞别人的文中赚取 Curation 奖励。 我的 Steem Power 依然每天根据 Steem 区块链的通膨而得到分红。 更好的是，在 Steem 低价的现在我所能得到的 SP 奖励更多了。所谓路遥知马力，真正验证一个币的实力就是时间。而 Steem 充分展现了无论在牛市还是熊市都可以同样产生价值的属性!

I scan through my long-term holding coins to identify which of them are able to self-generating income. Coins that is not self-generating Bitcoin: Not providing any value if not using for payment. Maybe can be a source to bring some bonus from bitcoin hardfork, like Bitcoin cash, Bitcoin Gold and etc. Ethereum: Some new ERC20 tokens will airdrop to ETH holders. Except that, ETH is not generating income. Cardano: ADA is mainly used for creating new smart contract like ETH and the platform is not ready yet. Not generating income. Litecoin, Stratis, Bitcoin Cash, Golem, Siacoin, IOTA is not generating any income by just holding it. Self-generating coins Steem: Nuff said. Even you are not participating in the Steem blockchain by authoring and curating, simply power up Steem to Steem Power is enough to earn the dividend from inflation every day. You could even sell your SP by delegate to others via Minnowbooster for higher income as well. Steem is definitely a self-multiplying machine. Neo: Holding neo will generate free GAS everyday and the price of GAS tends to follow NEO’s. Not a bad way to treat it as some passive income. Byteball: The nature of this coin is not self-generating, but the strategy running the devs is unique. They want to airdrop almost all the Byteball supply and so far 65% has been distributed. Holding Byteball can earn more of it by airdroping. These 3 coins are my holdings that are self-generating, what is yours? 在熊市中，很多持有的币都狠狠的被套着了。这让我不禁反思有哪些币在这样的环境中依然能够自我增值。 比特币作为支付用途，如果不用来支付就等于没用 。但是持有比特币还是有些增值的旁门左道，就是那些硬分叉币比如BCC 和 BTG 。 ETH 也不会自我增值，除了某些新的 ERC20 代币有时会空降下来。 Litecoin, Stratis, Bitcoin Cash, Golem, Siacoin, IOTA 全部都不会自我增值。 接下来就说说那些会生蛋的母鸡币了 Steem 当然当之无愧的是以币生币的最佳母鸡。就算完全不参与写作和 Curation，Steem Power 还是能让你每天收到系统通膨带来的分红，更别说通过 Minnowbooster 卖 SP 能赚更多了。 持有 NEO 也会根据一定的比率分发 GAS，而 GAS 的价格根据历史而言也是和 NEO 一起浮动的，所以也不失为一个被动收入的方法。 Byteball 虽然设计上不会自我增值，但是开发团队会把几乎接近总量的币靠空降的方式派发给持有者。目前总共才派发出 65% ，也是个不错的选择。 你有什么会下蛋的好币？ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Coins that lay eggs like a chicken 会下蛋的币’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/coins-that-lay-eggs-like-a-chicken/"},{"title":"Song A: “Yesterday Once More” by Carpenters.

Could not fully focus on my job but pay a big portion of my attention to enjoy the wonderful rhythm of it. After that shift, I quickly search for this song, download it(illegally, sorry), and loop it all day long. This was the song that leads me to others great songs by Carpenter as well. Karen Carpenter had the unique tone of voice and that makes her the best to sing this song ever, second to none even after bunches of reproduction by others. This song is simply made for her. 《昨日重现》是当时我在赌场做荷官时无意听到的一首歌，由现场的小乐队所演唱。前奏一响起就完全被吸引了，导致那几分钟有点无心工作。下班后，赶紧找出了这首歌，然后下载（不好意思，非法的）。当天记得就是无限 loop 了。Karen Carpenter 的独特声线简直就是为此歌而生，绝配！ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Song A: “Yesterday Once More” by Carpenters.

Moving other investment asset to crypto. Selling away my index fund stock for the Bitcoin. Invest in ICO using ETH occasionally. Crypto is now a huge part of my investment portfolio.

Don’t be confused by the shop name, it sells all kind of stuff other than just cameras. From home applicants to digital gaming accessories. I did not ask the cashier about how Bitcoin payment will be proceed as well as there is a huge language barrier between us. However I can guess the Bitcoin rate will follow the Bitflyer exchange as it is quoted on the board. We bought something but none was paid via Bitcoin. Despite of having an empty crypto wallet, I don’t wish my transaction for some small home accessories will takes up to 30 minutes to complete. Nor do I wish my transaction will cost at least 10 USD for network fee. Not to mention that Bic Camera offers extra 5% discount for Visa payment. To my humiliation as a crypto believer, I just can’t find a reason to spend my almighty Bitcoin in a Bitcoin-acceptable store. Maybe people have to start to consider accepting some superior coins, like Steem? 今天终于遇到了接受比特币的实体店，就是遍布日本各地的 Bic Camera 。遗憾的是，我毫无用比特币消费的欲望。由于语言不通，我也没细问店员比特币付款的详细过程。不过可以确定的是，我不想区区几间件商品的付款过程要花上半个小时的确认时间，更不想为这交易付上至少十美金的手续费。就更别提使用 Visa 付款还可享有 5% 的折扣。 在接受比特币的商店我居然一点都不想使用比特币，真的好讽刺。或许商家们是时候考虑更高效的货币，比如伟大的 Steem？ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘I don’’t want to spend Bitcoin in a store that accepts Bitcoin 讽刺的比特币’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/i-don-t-want-to-spend-bitcoin-in-a-store-that-accepts-bitcoin/"},{"title":"Never let your Voting Power overflown","text":"Everyone’s effective Steem Power(SP) worth something, and what makes it worth something is our precious Voting Power(VP). In HF19, everyone has a VP meter where the maximum is 100% at the regeneration rate 20% every day. Use it or not, VP stop regenerate at 100%. By that, it means wasting. Wasting the VP you could have used for voting, wasting the SP that make your vote worth something, wasting the money you could have casted to own/other’s articles. So the key is, never let the VP stays at 100% unspent. There are several ways to make sure not to waste voting power: Delegate SP to others. You receive nothing but the grace from the delegatees. Rent SP to projects like @minnowbooster or @utopian. You receive Steem or SBD in return for the lending. Actively casting votes, so that the voting power could never to be full. Use custom/third-party bot to cast votes. Any of the above-mentioned methods will keep your VP busy and not wasted. My personal favorite way is the last one. There is a ‘Sell Vote’ feature offered by @minnowbooster which you can set it up using this guide. You can define a condition whereby the bot will only use your posting key to vote when your VP is up to certain level. By this way, you will get to earn the curation reward at the same time @minnowbooster will pay you some SBD for selling them your vote. As I always try to keep my VP around 90%, I set sell my vote to the bot whenever VP reach 99%. In other word, @minnowbooster will start to vote for me as long as my VP is above 99%. The bot reacts to the rule promptly so that I will never reach 100% while maintain at high level of VP. Not bad. No matter what method you use, never let the VP overflown. 充分利用每天恢复 20% 的 Voting power (VP) 是非常重要的事，因为一旦达到 100% 而不使用，就意味着浪费 Steem power 赋予投票的力量，也意味着浪费金钱。 有几种方法确保不让 VP 过满而形成浪费： 每天踊跃投票，让 VP 远远低于 100% 。 把 SP 出租给@minnowbooster 或 @utopian 类似的服务，它们会提供一定的报酬。 把 SP 无酬委托给别人，除了被委托者的感恩什么也得不到。 用机器人定制自动投票机制。 以上的方法都可以确保 VP 不会过剩。个人而言，我最喜欢最后一个方法，但不是自己做个机器人那么麻烦，当然最重要还是因为我不会， 而是通过卖赞给 @minnowbooster 的方式来进行，不明白的可以参考这篇文章。 我让他们的机器人只有在我的 VP 达到 99% 或以上时才执行卖赞，所以 VP 不会过剩的同时也确保时时保持在高 VP 的状态，卖赞也还会有 SBD 的收入呢，一举三得哦！ 你又有什么高招呢？不管如何，请不要让 VP 过剩就是了。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Never let your Voting Power overflown’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/never-let-your-voting-power-overflown/"},{"title":"Worst job ever in Japan","text":"Today is our last night at Osaka before flying back to Singapore.

Then I spotted this worker by her machine-like, echoing voice. She was repeating the promotion phrase in Chinese language like “Please come visit our store for 85% discount if you purchase more than…”, “We’ve got huge variation of products…”, and so on, while waving the advertisement board at the crowd manually. For the whole period I was sitting at the staircase, non-stop. Guess she and her coworkers will have to do this all day long. This is probably the most meaningless job I’ve ever witnessed in first world country. Totally replaceable by a machine and her workforce would be producing more value elsewhere instead of just shouting the same phrases over and over.

It gave a 78% probability that XLM/BTC would trade above 0.000051 before February 20. And it was wrong. While the whole market is starting to recover, Bitcoin is taking the rising lead from the bad crash to $6000 to around $11000. This resulted in a drop of the majority of altcoins in term of BTC value, including XLM. Bad thing is, obviously, I ‘lose money’ because it doesn’t play out as planned. But it’s OK as I’m more than well-prepared for this to happen and this is just a little fun experiment for me. I felt worse in losing 24 points in the application as I took part in the XLM prediction as well. As you can see, I made a 74% prediction in that question as well. Couldn’t put all the blame on the indicator nonetheless right? The good thing is I get to know more about Stellar by acquiring them. And I’m not going to sell just because it doesn’t meet the initial target, all I have to do is just converting this investment from short-term to medium-term. If I had to be more optimistic, this represents a longer opportunity to buy in with a lower price using Bitcoin. Will I still believe in Cindicator? Of course, it’s not like they have failed me 10 times in a row. In fact, they never guaranteed a 100% accuracy, nothing did. 几天前根据 Cindicator 买的 XLM 信号，结局是预测错误。XLM/.BTC 并没有在二月二十号之前越过 0.000051 BTC 。比特币从前一阵子的狂跌至 $6000 恢复到目前的 $11000，可谓十分强势。也难怪所有小货币们在和比特币的对比当中落下风了。 算了吧，反正这也是预料中事，几天的短期投机本来就是充满风险。不卖就不算亏损。 好处是，透过这次的投机行动我认识了 Stellar 这个很不错的项目，就算短期内脱不了手也大可转为长期持有。如果说还不够乐观，那就把这次机会当作是低价入手 XLM 的时机拉长了吧。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Cindicator’’s indicator was wrong’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/cindicator-s-indicator-was-wrong/"},{"title":"Cute logo in random Japan alley","text":"We were in this random alley somewhere in Nara looking for a restaurant that Google Map suggested.

While my girlfriend is ready to sweep the cosmetic shops really bad, I was hoping to visit some art supplies store to enrich my art creating supplies. With some Googling, I found a truly awesome art store in Osaka, the U-ARTS. Storefront of U-ARTS. Nothing fancy but looks very practical for what I need a art store to look like. On the first floor you can find all kind of art materials and tools. This is a section of pencils and charcoals, but not limited to what has shown in the picture. Finally, this is what I was searching for in the store. Copic markers! They are slightly more expensive than what I’ve seen in the other small art store though. However, the store carries the whole color scheme of Copic. To make things more awesome, they even have the refillable ink for all 300+ of Copic markers! Oil, acrylics, watercolors, you name it, they have it. Including all kind of ‘accessories’ like gesso and primer, and a lot more other stuff that I do not know what they are used for. The second floor is all about fundamental to splash the creativity upon. Papers, primed canvas, and you can some art mounting or framing service here as well. SummaryThe only drawback of U-ARTS is their pricing which is slightly more expensive than others. For someone who stays longer in Japan, try to opt for Amazon Japan for similar products for a lower price. However, their strength is the easily the completeness and wide variety of product lines that available in one-stop. You will be able to try out all the markers, pencils and tools on the racks. One huge bonus for the travelers, their products are all tax-free! Nice point to have to offset the above-average pricing. So if you are in Osaka and eager to find some art supplies, you can’t miss U-ARTS!

They have a really clean and user-friendly site that makes things really clear even for those who are first time in using such service. Vote buyingThere are two bots to vote base on request using different mechanism. @smartsteem is a bid bot that votes every 2.4 hours. The return of vote value is not guaranteed as it is depends on how many bids it received within the time frame. So it doesn’t have much different compared to the other bid bot. @smartmarket however, is a their signature upvote-service. They claimed to provide fixed value of vote that is at least 2.0~2.5 times the amount user sent. From my experience, it provides at least 2 times of vote value by sending SBD. For instance, sending 5 SBD for will get a vote that worth $10. The voting happens almost instantly so no waiting time is needed. For more please visit their faq page.

These games are often found to be one of the main entertainments for the older generation folks. Unfortunately, my mom is one of them. Image source She has been a loyal customer for lottery company like TOTO, Damacai, and whatever 4D, 5D, 6D shit, for more than 20 years. Although she is not as desperate as those serious lottery gamblers, she would constantly contribute a couple of hundreds of Malaysia Ringgit to the lottery company every month. Those number could add up to a handsome sum. Ironically, she knows she stands a slim chance of getting back the betting capital, let alone winning a huge Jackpot. But still, she couldn’t leave the losing game while keep telling us that she is going to give it up ‘soon’ for the last ten years. Pathetically funny. Image source This has to be changedWe’ve talked about this topic yesterday and somehow I just felt like I’ve had enough of her lottery addiction that I make a suggestion: From now on, whenever you feel like going to buy the lottery tickets, drop those cash in a box. I will collect and use it to invest in crypto on your behalf. I’m not sure if one day she would hit a big jackpot to not only cover all lost bets over the decades but winning a huge lump sum of money which is more than enough to retire herself. There is only one thing I’m really certain, and that is the chances of any top 100 cryptocurrencies skyrocketing is much likely to happen than she hitting that big jackpot. Furthermore, I added some irresistible clauses in the one-year deal. That is regardless how the crypto investment is doing after one year, I will pay her investment back with at least 50% gaining out of my pocket. Meaning if she invested a total of $5000 then she will at least get back a sum of $7500 no matter what. If market decides that she will gain 10 times of her capital, that is what she will be received too. The deal is on, of course.The next question is, in what coin should I invest for my mom? I’m not intended to diversify her portfolio as that would be too troublesome for me to maintain. Wait, she is very interested in my articles in Steem and would read it every day despite having no idea what all these crypto and blockchain tech is about. My mom is definitely one of my biggest supporters to create content on Steem. Then why not I use her money to regularly buy in Steem and power my account up? Brilliant idea indeed! Some will say that crypto is a high-risk investment, I should not put all the eggs in one basket. Maybe. But rather than letting the money completely ‘donated’ to lottery company with almost zero chance to get back any of it, betting it with crypto sounds a lot wiser to me. By making this deal with my lottery-addicted mom… She can finally give up the addiction which is almost as same as throwing coins in the sea. She is already in a 100% winning position as I personally guaranteed her ROI no matter how is the crypto investment’s performance. She can now support my work on Steem both spiritually and financially. I can grow my SP over the course by her regular investment. Even if I got to pay cash out all her Steem after one year, I will still be benefited a lot by the additional SP. Lastly, if Steem fails and drops to zero she is not losing anyhow. As this will be the same result as betting in lottery. She already handed me her first investment fund that would otherwise spend on the lottery.

Previous post I’ve shared one of the best art supplies shop in Osaka and let me show you my booty. The best thing that excited me the most is this drawing guidance book released by Copic itself. It showcases everything about the amazing markers and the way to use them professionally in the way that I could never imagine. The first picture is one of the samples and I did not expect simple markers could achieve such a stunning result. The book costs 1800 Yen and that is the first physical book I bought in the past 10 years, it will worth every penny if I able to learn as much as possible from it. Another great showcase of marker art. These tutorials are as detailed as hand-to-hand teaching. Simply blown away by how good and useful these markers are created for. Getting all these techniques will truly enhance my drawing skills with or without these marker. The book is fully written in Japanese which I don’t understand at all. But I guess words may not be really important as the picture tells a thousand words. If I ever need the translation, Google Translation will always be my side as well. I’ve tested it, the translation accuracy is not bad Dada! This is 36 color Copic sketch set that I always wanted! And this is the most expensive purchase I have made in Japan too, costs 11,000 Yen. The art shop doesn’t carry the highest 72 color set or I would consider getting it instead. Actually I still can buy all the markers one by one if I wanted, but I have to give some legit excuse for me to skip the further damage to my wallet. This set of markers will serve me long enough already. You don’t own a complete set of marker art creation if you don’t have the right paper to draw on. This Copic sketchbook is specially designed for marker art. It claims to not letting the color penetrating through the papers which is the common problem coloring on normal paper. It does help to save some marker ink as well I guess. Family photo of the trio! They could really keep me busy for a long while. Let’s begin a new self-taught journey. 除了美食美景，去日本最大的收获就是这三剑客。首先是 Copic 出品的马克笔绘画教程，真的有让我大开眼界之感，大叹原来马克绘画还能如此神！本文第一张就是全用 Copic 马克笔画的，很厉害吧？它绝对能让我的绘画技术更上一层楼！ 第二养东西就是 36 色的 Copic 马克笔，同时也是在日本买到最贵的单品，价值十一千日元。还好 72 色的套装断货了，不然我还可能会花双倍的价格入手，真替荷包君捏了一把冷汗。 最后就是专门为马克笔而设计的画本，有着颜色不会渗透纸张的优点，我想这样的话还可以节省一些墨水吧。 这些家伙应该都足够让我忙碌好长一阵子了。 期待和你们分享用它们创作的第一幅作品！ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘New toys – COPIC collection from the Japan! 新玩具们’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/new-toys-copic-collection-from-the-japan/"},{"title":"Best revenue of SP delegation, Minnowbooster or Smartsteem?","text":"SP delegation is a well-known way to earn some of the best profit out of your SP. This method is especially suitable for those who are lazy to be active in the socializing, lazy to vote for curation reward, lazy to write posts for author reward, and so on. Delegating all the SP away not only can skip all those ‘troubles’ but also make a nice profit out from the delegation. @minnowbooster and @smartsteem are two biggest reliable platforms for SP delegation as far as I experienced, though they implementing different mechanism. The former using leasing contract method with a fixed delegation days while the latter allows the delegation lasts as long as the user wishes. Math time to compare revenueThere is a Calculate Revenue button at the site which is very handy in calculating profit for SP delegation. Type in any amount of SP and it will tell you the estimated revenue in 3 forms: Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Profit. While minnowbooster site clearly shows the specification of each Lease Request in a table view. Leasers can easily choose to fill whatever offer they like. For easier comparison, we only compare the revenue generated on monthly basis. Current exchange rate for SBD/STEEM will be used for rate conversion, 1 SBD = 1.053 STEEM. Comparison 1 This is 4 weeks lease request on Minnowbooster where the user request for 102 SP while leaser can receive an effective payment of 2.52 STEEM. Input 102 in the ‘Steempower’ column on the Startsteem revenue calculator, we can tell that the monthly revenue is 3.246 SBD. 3.246*1.053 = 3.418 STEEM. 3.418 STEEM from Smartsteem and 2.52 STEEM from Minnowbooster. Round 1, Smartsteem wins! Comparison 2 4-week lease request of 973 SP with payment of 24 STEEM from Minnowbooster. In Smartsteem we could get 30.961 SBD for the same amount of delegation. 30.961*1.053 = 32.602 STEEM. 32.602 STEEM vs 24 STEEM. That is as much as 33% bonus! Smartsteem wins again. Comparison 3 Now let’s take a look at larger SP delegation request which is 4865 SP for the price of 150 STEEM from Minnowbooster. We got 154.806 SBD from the Smartsteem. 154.806*1.053 = 163.011 STEEM. You would earn extra 13 STEEM here. Smartsteem still got the victory in the end! Conclusion@smartsteem is obviously the best choice now from the revenue perspective for SP delegation. Although it was mainly based on the advantage of paying SBD, which is hugely strayed away from the USD pegging mechanism for very long time. However judging from the SBD past behavior, receiving payment in SBD could be very rewarding as well if you look at their potential to skyrocket to last ATH at 14 USD, which was once 1 SDB = 9 STEEM. Hope this could make your life easier in choosing which platform to delegate your SP. If you know some other better sites, let me know in the comment.

You ranked #103 with 1517 points in the crypto markets challenge and #5181 with 0 points in the traditional markets challenge, earning you a total of 0.02104335 ETH across both ratings. Yep, the result was 0.02104335 ETH (roughly 18 USD) for a #103 rank last month. They also attached a public google sheet for Cindicator February report, take a look there if you ever took part in predicting. There are over 10,000 predictors in the Crypto market, feels great that I could be ranked at that high! I know, 0.02 ETH seems too little for the all the efforts, it depends on how you look at it. I spent not more than 5 minutes every day on the prediction and it is not taxing at all. The total prize is only worth of 1.25 BTC for thousand participants to share. Don’t expect a handsome return if you are not in the top 10 list, where they averagely receive 0.3 ETH. There is some bonus too By placing #103 in one of the challenges you have also gained access to the Cindicator Bot for one month on the Beginner plan. I also earn an one-month access to Beginner plan which normally will need a minimum possession of 5,000 CND. Beginner plan allows the user to access some of the processed indicators to both crypto and traditional market so it can be treated as a trading signal as well. This alone could be more valuable than the 0.02 ETH prize money. Except I already entitled to this exact plan. But not bad for a bonus too. Will I keep predicting in Cindicator?Why not? But it might not purely for the prize. I found that the satisfaction from predicted something accurately is very rewarding as well. And knowing that I did a pretty good job in market analysis is something I never expected as well. 上次分享的 Cindicator 市场预测二月份成绩终于出炉啦。在超过十千位参与者里很意外的我排名 #103，还真的很好运啊。那么这么高的排名能得到的分红有多少呢？ 答案是 0.02104335 ETH (约为 18 USD)。 我知道你心里在说很少，说真的是有点少啦。但从另一个角度出发，我每天画不超过五分钟的时间在上面，实在是玩一场手机游戏花的时间都多过这个。而且除了 0.02 ETH 我还可以免费使用“初级配套” 一个月来查看经过处理的信号，这个通常要有 5000 CND 才可以解锁，当然我是已经有了。对于没有的人来说还是很不错的。 我会继续参与预测，但可能就不是为了钱了，毕竟在这写文的收入来得更容易。当做小游戏来玩把，追求成功预测某些东西的成就感也是很不错的。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘See how much I’’ve earned in Cindicator’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/see-how-much-i-ve-earned-in-cindicator/"},{"title":"Dream drawing challenge 如烟似梦 | 齐白石杯 月旦评","text":"I’ve spent 1.5 hours on this artwork.

The main reason is that GPU has been overpriced due to the mining freak for crypto starting 2017. And to be honest, I was too distracted by many things like blogging on Steem that I left behind the original attempt to build a PC for gaming. This is why I never invested a dedicated GPU for the new PC yet. One day, I feel like have some gaming session over the weekend and I just realized that there are many choices for games other than graphics demanding games like GTA 5. The great example is Nintendo classic console gaming which some regard as pixel games. I am a pure 90’s baby who spent a really joyful childhood on the classic Nintendo TV games. Thanks for all the console gaming enthusiast, many of the console games already ported to PC Windows platform and you can find plenty of guides on Internet about how to set up one.

You can play all kind of games including but not limited to Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Genesis, and others. However the only downside is that the configuration will be not so straightforward. Following awesome guides from Howtogeek and Lifehacker is all you need to do. Finally you will need the games! The Eye is the single most powerful site you ever need, at least that is true for me as I found all NES games there. As of right now, The Eye hosts 20515GB of data.

They are mainly based on two things, technical analysis(TA) and news. Image source TA is what I believe the least if not at allCryptocurrencies(aka Blockchain) is something that is going to change our world forever like the Internet. The world had no idea the Internet can achieve what it has achieved today, no way for the mass to predict the future of a disruptive technology in the infant stage. The same conclusion applies on the cryptocurrencies. If you used the same old technique that used to analyze traditional market like stock and precious metal, in analyzing a market that never exists before, it just doesn’t make sense. However, if you really need to learn how to do some awesome TA on crypto, this is the only guide you need to read presented by @kevinwong. Trading the news is making more senseBuy the rumor, sell the news is really an effective tactic only if you are active and sensitive enough to sniff all the slight movement of a straw in the wind. But that is going to take a heavy toll on your time if you follow more than 5 projects. And you might get caught in the fake news by the pump-and-dump folks, ended up executing wrong moves and lose money. Furthermore, trading altcoins short or medium term base on abovementioned tactics has a really huge disadvantage. That is when the whole market crash, which usually lead by the Bitcoin, altcoins drops 10~20% more than BTC. After the recession, market will always enter bullish movement(if you are wondering this is how the economy works, not TA) which usually will be leading by BTC, again. And the already in-red altcoins will be bleeding even more against BTC. This is a losing war without ending, unless you are changing them to long-term holding. This is not an empty sentiment but I’m speaking from experience.In fact, my altcoins portfolio is still at -50% loss from the last 800B-to-400B crash which was about 2 months ago. If my initial investment was 1 BTC, selling all those altcoins that I bought according to the trading signals would leave me not more than 0.5 BTC. This is why I stop the active trading at all as I don’t want to sell at loss. And this is what making me reflects on this investment strategy that would be useful in the bullish market, but locking me up upon the bear arrival. After all, making them as my long-term holding coins probably is one of the best plans available now. There are more ways to force you into the loop of mistakes and I’m not going to list them all, after all it would take me at least 10 posts to finish that list. Just have to take my time for a reflection in low tide as of now. Trading signals are not really effective in growing wealth all the while, I shall keep experiment and tweaking the strategies. Stay tuned. 不交易货币好久，这段时间也该好好反省之前所执行的炒币策略。前一阵子我根据 Telegram altcoin trading channel 给出的信号不断炒币，在那阵子的牛市中的确有所斩获。然而在现在的熊市就不行了。那些信号主要有两种根据，technical analysis (TA) 和新闻。 用 TA 这种旧技术来分析前所未见的加密货币市场这件事，对我而言是相当可笑的，所以从来也不屑一顾。基于新闻的信号就比较有看头了，很明显的所有货币都被各种好坏消息显著的影响着。如果你有本事捕捉各种最新消息，那么很大可能是可以获利的，只是代价就是要付出大量时间精力。 这样根据信号的交易方针坏处就是一旦市场崩溃，统统就会被套牢了，也是我目前的囧境。看来必须要好好乘这个低潮期好好反思一下有什么可以更进取的地方。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Reflection of my trading strategy that is not working really well’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/reflection-of-my-trading-strategy-that-is-not-working-really-well/"},{"title":"I'm making a $400 passive income out of $2300 investment","text":"Disclaimer: This is not a clickbait Half a year ago when I first boarding the on the Stem blockchain, I did not only dedicated most of my free time creating content on this amazing platform. But I also bought some Steem with around $2300 at the price of $1 by that time. Adding up all the SP and SBD I earned through the last 228 days by almost writing every day, my total SP is now at 3596.024. This is of course just a negligible amount in the sea of Steem full of dolphins and whales. I used to think about it that way until I decided to look at how much I could earn if delegating all those SP away to some solid platforms like Smartsteem / @smartsteem. Revenue CalculationWithout much troubles, Smartsteem provided a handy Revenue Calculation feature on their front page. So I can roughly get a payout of 114 SBD every month with all my SP delegated to the platform. Math time again. Using current rate 1 SBD = $3.5, 114*3.5 = $400. I could earn 400 USD every month while literally doing nothing at all now. Let’s take it furtherBack to my hometown in Melaka, fresh graduates starting pay is averaging about RM2000 per month. Not a really decent wages, but many of them just managed to survive anyhow. While 400 USD equals to RM1558, I almost earn as much as those freshmen passively! It is such a complicated mood while feeling sorry for the low pay that my fellow homie is making, easy revenue like this blew my mind away at the same time. Knowing the fact that we can actually cash out Steem or SDB make the whole thing even more real. I could really choose to resign my full-time job in Singapore and become half-retired in my hometown if I wanted. Of course, I’m not retiring just for a $400 passive incomeNor I will delegate all SP away anytime soon as being totally powerless makes me feels like standing naked on the street. It is truly impressive to know that the initial investment of a $2300 and dedication in content creating could lead me to a pseudo-financial-freedom like this.

Credit to my company, based on the past contribution they are sending me my monthly payout of RM600($170) for last 22 months when I wasn’t working for them at all. First of all, I’m experiencing some of the best passive income in the world now where I’m making a $400 passive income out of $2300 investment. That was an one-time effort and I do not need to approach all the friends and strangers to hard sell the products from MLM company. I break no sweat and I burn no network, as you might aware, people are not very fond of MLM scheme. 2. If I’m working for the other companies, I would be long delisted from their employee list for being away for straight 22 months. But this company is awesome! They not only keeping their promise but pay me accordingly with justice! Oh, if investing in Steem considering working for this blockchain, I would still be in the game 1000 year after I’m long dead. No one is kicking me out, no one can decide whether I’m still useful for the company. No matter how innovative an MLM company is, they are still centralized. And no matter how stable and trust-worthy the company is, there is still a possibility that you are kicked from the game by a mere sudden decision by a management member. Think this way, how secure can a company be if a country could go bankrupt? This is a direct comparison between decentralization and centralization application. I tried to explain what risk he is taking but to no avail. He could not even grab the idea of centralization. Of course I might be in the bigger risk considering Steem is just another social experiment in the sea of blockchain project, but at least I acknowledged that risk. There will be no consensus between us while we trying to convince each other with a completely different opinion. Coincidentally, I wrote a post on this exact topic one month ago, Steem is better than MLM. Shared it with him after the discussion, let’s hope he will enjoy the read. 我有个对传销系统很狂热的友人，最近刚从澳洲 22 个月的旅游工作计划回来大马。面对我们这班朋友长久以来的困惑和不理解，他特意写了一大篇信息（作文）来解释为何他对他的传销公司如此有信心，重点摘要如下： 1. 我所经历你未遇见的不在职收入，在我离开大马完全无法工作的的 22 个月里，XX 公司坚守承诺的基于我以往的业绩，提供给我每月马币600令吉的收入。 不好意思，我已经遇见了不在职收入，而且要比你的好上很多。上一篇《I’m making a $400 passive income out of $2300 investment》就足以说明一切。 2. 要是在别的传统公司，不工作 22 个月我早就除名了。XX公司却不一样，依然定时给予我所应得的分红，XX公司值得信赖！ 这就更好笑了，你所谓的信赖完全建立在中心化的组织手中。不管目前如何稳定，总归有被开除的可能性。这样想吧，当一个国家都可以破产时，何况区区一个公司？Steem 这类的区块链项目就不同了，即使在我死后的一千年后我依然还在此局中。除了我自己，没人能决定我的去留。单是这点就高下立判。 凑巧的是，一个月前我正好就此话题写了一篇《比传销更好》，立马分享给了我这朋友，希望他好好消化，同时不要拉黑我。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘My friend tried to lure me with passive income from centralized MLM scheme when I’’m having the superior Steem’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/my-friend-tried-to-lure-me-with-passive-income-from-centralized-mlm-scheme-when-i-m-having-the-superior-steem/"},{"title":"Don't delegate all your SP away","text":"From the post Best revenue of SP delegation, Minnowbooster or Smartsteem?, we’ve come to a conclusion that @smartsteem is a more competent platform for SP delegation. I have a friend @seandeanayao who has invested a little in SP but he was too busy to be constantly active to make full use of his power. Dit not want his SP laying wasted in the account, I recommended him to delegate all his SP to @smartsteem. As he is not very familiar with all the hustle, I was the one who executed the delegation on his behalf. I made a mistake by delegating ALL of his SP awayWhile he will be active in socializing with others on Steem, he does consistently making new post here. And this is what happened to him just now. He completely ran out of bandwidth and could not post anything at all. While I delegated 256 SP out of his 257 SP, the effective 1.04 SP only grant him a couple kb of bandwidth, which of course will run out in no time. I have to be honest that I never expect such thing would be happening. As I joined the platform with some SP invested already. My bad anyway. Summary Do not delegate all of your SP unless you do not want to participate in the blockchain at all(commenting or posting). You don’t get back all the SP after undelegation immediately, it will take 7 days to cooldown in order to precent system abuse. The best way to increase bandwidth? Buy some Steem and power it up, instant solution.

In fact, it was meant to be a dead end shielded by a plant wall as you can see, it is a sort of a corner garbage collection point. However this corner falls on the straight route between a bus stop and many offices. And yes, this is not the only way for the workers to get attend their work but this is the fastest route. The red circle has somehow become a ‘breakthrough’ and this was the shortcut for most of the workers including me. After a couple of months, maybe the traffic has annoyed the operators at garbage center, or this shortcut is not supposed to be allowed, someone blocked it with a pile of obstacles. Will the people now make a detour just because the shortcut was blocked? No, they make a new shortcut.The green circle spot was a thinner spot for the plant wall, the cost of passing through that spot is every part of your body will be scratched by the branches and leaves. Uncomfortable experience, but the trespassers also breaking some little branches and leaves at the same time. The thin spot becomes thinner. As more people passing by the gap-to-be weak spot(including me), we have a brand new shortcut within a few weeks. People are not only lazy to take a further tour, they make a new door for their greater good when the authority closed the other. This reminds me very much of cryptocurrency resistance by the weak-minded government in closing down exchanges or bank accounts that has something to do with this illegal currency. They close down the path of people cashing out their crypto into fiat, in the hope of deterring people from joining the activity of crypto. Does that make us get rid of crypto? No, we make a new way out. We can start trading peer to peer instead of relying on the centralized exchanges. Agent or black market appear just to fill the blank of this demanding market. Or even better, some of us choose to stay in crypto which will eventually speed up the growth of this ground-breaking technology. If someone blocks the way between you and what you are believing in, the only thing you should do is make your own path to it. 上图是我每天早上上班的常用途径。图中可以看到这本不该是一条路，而是一个由植物墙围起来作为垃圾处理站的死胡同。但是偏偏这个地点就落在附近主要巴士站和办公室区的直线路径上，虽然不是上班族抵达公司的必经之路，但绝对是省时省力的一条捷径，此为故事背景。 早些时候，红圈中的树墙不知何时出现了一个缺口，然后附近上班的人们很自然的就把这条路变成了主要途径之一。这样过了好几个月，不知道是垃圾站的工人受不了人潮或是这本不是一条正常的路，这个缺口就被人堵上了。那你猜猜，人们是不是就这样放弃捷径而去绕远路？ 不会，他们会开创新的缺口。 绿圈所示的缺口本来不是如今这般大，它本来是树墙中比较稀薄的一区，硬生生走过去要付出的代价，就是全身上下都会被树枝树叶抚摸个遍，不太好受。然而总会有想抄捷径的人。第一个人穿越此处时虽然会有点难受，但在过程中却也折断了些许小树枝树叶，稀薄的树墙变得更稀薄了。此后贪方便的人们一来一往，不出几个礼拜，就成了图中的样子，新的捷径就这样出现了。 这让我联想到币圈这阵子所遭遇的抵抗，尤其是来自思想落伍的政府政客们。为了让人们远离非法的加密货币，关闭提供变现通道的交易所为最常见的手段。然而，人们是不是因为这样就会乖乖就范？ 不会，他们会用别的方法变现。 时下流行的用户对用户式交易就是去中心化的交易管道之一，随之而来的还有各种代理和黑市崛起，以填补市场上忽然出现的强烈需求。有者更甚，干脆留在币圈里不变现了。这样倒好，政府的阻扰反而加速了加密货币的普及。 所以，要是有人尝试在你和你所信仰的事物之间设立障碍，另辟蹊径是你唯一该做的事情。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘What happen if a shortcut was blocked? 另辟蹊径的小故事 | 月旦评’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/what-happen-if-a-shortcut-was-blocked-or/"},{"title":"Drawing challenge - Spring 春兆 | 齐白石杯 月旦评","text":"I’ve spent 2.5 hours on this artwork. The tools involved were Copic markers on Copic sketchbook that was specially designed for marker paint. This is also an entry for @angelina6688 ‘s drawing competition with the theme ‘Spring‘. Finally, I got the chance to put my new 36 color Copic markers into real use. I had struggles in applying these advanced markers to achieve what I used to achieve with other tools. But after all, I would say it was totally worth the learning curve. I’m convinced that Copic is the top marker maker in the world and they are second to none. They are so expensive for a reason(380 yen for a single marker!). Now I can sell away the ordinary market set that I bought from China a few months back without worry. As for the subject, I chose a flower that blossoms in the snow at the end of winter. Snow and flower make a strong contrast for winter and spring, I think it is the best sign of spring arrival. 此作品花了两个半小时来完成，用的是久违的 36 色 Copic 马克笔在也是 Copic 出版的马克笔画本上作画。出乎意料的花了比预期还多的时间来完成，主要是第一次使用具有颜色性的马克笔，许多混合调色的技巧都还很陌生，尤其是雪的效果就琢磨了好久。 这同时也是用于参加由 @angelina6688 所举办的“春”绘画比赛 。 每次参加新的一次绘画比赛，其中最有趣的就是根据主题选材料，可以说每次想要画些什么都会费煞思量，以至偶尔迟迟无法下笔。好的选材就是成功的一半，这是我坚信的。有好些绘画比赛都是由于想不出有什么题材可以很独特的切入主题而放弃不参加。关于上一期的主题“梦”，尽管范围很广，似乎画什么都不会错，甚至我可以画一画心仪已久的球鞋，而说成这是梦想中的礼物，想必也可以浑水摸鱼，一并被评委通过参加资格。但也说过了，与其这样为了参加而参加，还不如不参加。 而这次的主题“春”，我想表现的是“春天”，又是一个选材难题，挣扎了好几天，还好最后还是想到了。 这次使用的是“春暖花开”来暗示春的降临，但如果只画开花的景象，未免也太普通了。于是就想到了使用冰雪和花苞初开的小黄花作为强烈的对比。生命力顽强的小花，在寒土里潜伏了整个冬季为的就是等到这一刻春的气息。温暖的阳光刚一回到岗位，冬季尾声的遍地冰雪尚未融化，小花早已迫不及待的破土而出了。 没什么现象更能诠释这春的先兆了。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Drawing challenge - Spring 春兆 | 齐白石杯 月旦评’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/drawing-challenge-spring-or/"},{"title":"Best trading strategy for HODLers!","text":"I did a reflection on my trading strategy in altcoin trading which could totally hinder the trading activity when the overall market is bearish. Yes, which is the market we currently at, a big bear crypto market. I was constantly searching for a better, reliable strategy on trading. As I do not wish to put too much of time and effort on following every single coin’s movement in the rapid market, putting my trust to trading channel who can do the job much better than me was a great idea. While their trading signals could be useful base on accurate news, the fact is no one could ever predict how the market is going to behave. Here I present you the next strategy I’m going to apply next, Portfolio RebalancingI knew this technique for quite a while the first day I trading in stock market, most of the investment geeks out there would know too. But I have never take a serious look at it, I was aiming to find some projects that could offer 100X return which of course never happened to me yet. For those who has no idea about portfolio rebalancing, this is how it works: Investor setup a portfolio with several assets which he would set certain ratio each asset should contain in the portfolio, total ratio adds up to 100%. Let’s say Bob assign 6 assets to his portfolio with 16.67% each. He would take a look at it at the end of every month, and those assets would have performed differently. Like the diagram below. Image sourceSome performed well that went up to 20% and some dropped to 10% in the ratio. What Bob needs to do is just rebalance the whole portfolio by sell way the excessive portion of the well-performed asset and fill in the underperformed one. The portfolio is now rebalanced, until they are out of ratio again.I was actually inspired by this article. It even demonstrates how useful this technique is by the following real-life calculation:&gt;In order to demonstrate the potential advantage over holding coins, we performed a simulation with real market data over a 1-year period. This period started on December 1st 2016 and ended on December 1st 2017. With an initial investment of $5,000, we allocated an equal amount into Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Dash, and Litecoin ($1,000 in each). At the end of the one-year period, a person who had bought and held each currency would have $223,596.05. On the other hand, a person who had rebalanced over the same period, would have $353,000.87. This means rebalancing performed 58% better over buy and hold after 1 year.You might argue that one does not simply predict the future base on history. But in this case it is really convincing to me and attractive enough to start practicing it. You can use their Shrimpy rebalancing bot for auto rebalance execution which is now limited on Bittrex and Poloniex only, or you can build a spreadsheet profile and execute rebalancing manually. If you have some programming skill, you can even build your own bot.## Advantages vs DisadvantagesBased on my analysis, portfolio rebalancing has it’s good and bad as well. Nothing is suitable for everyone right?#### The good:- Totally get rid of the biggest of trading: emotion. We all have been the victim of FOMO and FUD. By rebalancing you care no about news or TA, making everything back in designated ratio is all needed to do.- Especially suitable for Hodler. If your belief is Hold until they are at the Moon, this technique could make hugely improve your final return.- No news tracking, no line drawing on the charts and listen to no BS by those experts. Now you can save tons of time and get a life.#### The bad:- For greater rebalancing convinience, all the involved coins need to put on exchange’s hand. And you don’t technically own whatever coins in the exchange.- All the assets in the portfolio must be performing well in the long run. Or else you will be pouring more and more winning money into the weak coins over times.- You are not getting 100X or 1000X return by rebalancing.This is not a financial advice. You are at your own risk. 继上次的投资策略反思后 ，发现根据信号进行买卖不会有太好的效果。主要是尽管根据新闻的信号还算可靠，但事实是没有人可以真正预测市场将会往哪个方向走。现在这个忽如其来的币圈大熊市就是很好的例子。 接下来会尝试投資組合再平衡（Portfolio Rebalancing）。相信这个投资策略对很多投资老手来说不会新鲜。对没听过的人还是要介绍下： 根据启发我不少的这篇文章，投資組合再平衡就是设置好每个资产的比例，过一段特定的时间再把同样一套投资组合重新平衡到当初的比例。 这样做的获利原理就是将表现好的货币买了，来买进表现不好的。投資組合再平衡很无情的使投资者严格的执行了“买高卖低”这个赚钱的万年不变真理。请留意“无情”一词，这个策略完全摒弃了投资者最为危险的情绪，从而降低了犯错的几率。有频繁在市场交易过的人都受过 FUD 和 FOMO 不少大亏。 另一个大好处就是你不再需要再时时捕风抓影，在走势图上画没人看得懂的线条，更加不用去听所谓专家们的独家分析。时间到，把跑掉的组合比例调回来就好。可以使用这个软件进行自动再平衡化。 当然这也不是完全没有坏处的： 这不会让你一夜之间有百倍的回报，投资冷门币却有可能。 需要把组合里的币都放在交易所里。 所选定的币种必须长期下来都是有好的发展，不然等于慢慢的把赚回来的钱丢进亏钱的无底洞，所以必须选稳定的大币作为组合基调。 以上的言论不构成投资建议 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Best trading strategy for HODLers!’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/best-trading-strategy-for-hodlers/"},{"title":"Minnowbooster and Smartsteem, which one to go for vote-selling?","text":"For those who want to take full advantage of Steem power (SP) without participating in the Steem blockchain at all, there are bots which can help in two ways: SP delegation and Vote-selling. I’ve compared the the SP delegation profitability to @minnowbooster and @smartsteem in the previous post. Considering SP delegation is not for everyone, vote-selling is another popular option for the divers in Steem. Let’s take a look at the comparison of the two giants on Vote-selling service, shall we? Vote-selling in Minnowbooster First of all, the payout. You get 85% of all the sold votes they cast for you. Plus curation rewards which are coming from the posts payout which is totally unpredictable as the bot can cast votes for all the vote buyers. Minnowbooster does have a referral link for new member recruitment which I did not expect at first. However, I failed to locate any detail on how they handle the referral bonus to referrers. Is the referrer credited if the recruited filled a lease order, vote-selling or bot delegation? I tried a several searches on Google and Steemit, including a thorough scan at their FAQ page, all to no avail. Please enlighten me if you know any information on this. Vote-selling in Smartsteem Vote seller receives 85% of the profit which is same as Minnowbooster. However, Smartsteem provides a really convenient Revenue Calculator which allows users to get a rough idea how much they are going to make. ‘ While you still get to receive the additional Curation reward that incurred during vote-selling process, technically it is impossible to predict how much you are going to make out of this extra bonus. With the exclusive SmartScore Stars system, I would say one is likely to score more handsome rewards with Smartsteem. Under user Settings you will find this section of Vote User Selection where you can decide who you will sell your vote to. With SmartScore Stars selected, your vote will only cast to the whitelisted users which you can review in this list. All the whitelisted user is hand-picked by the team and I have picked several users for quality check, almost all of them are quality content creators I would say or you can kindly check the whitelist out yourselves. The team did not reveal their star rating standard but they did a fair job on it nonetheless. We know the first rule of Steem, good content usually get rewarded more. So I think it is safe to say that vote-sellers can get higher Curation reward via Smartsteem provided they sell votes to the SmartScore Stars users. Unlike Minnowbooster, Smartsteem makes everything clear on the referrals bonus that referrers will receive 0.5% profit of every sold vote by the referrals. And I’m receiving referral bonus from my recruitment. However I cannot tell which service is more superior in this aspect unless Minnowbooster makes a clear declaration like Smartsteem did. Nor did I ever referred anyone to Minnowbooster. Note: One can only receive referral bonus by vote-selling in Smartsteem. @therealwolf should start to consider taking SP delegation into account. Conclusion Both services provide 85% profit for vote-selling. Curation rewards are unpredictable but Smartsteem tends to be the winner with their killer SmartScore Stars system. Both services carry referral system while Minnowbooster remains totally unclear and Smartsteem provides a solid 0.5% profit. Minnowbooster seems like doesn’t care much about vote-selling service as their main focus is in the well-known SP Lease Market. At the same time, Smartsteem treats vote-selling as the core business that they build some complimentary stuff like Whitelist and Vote Selection around it. Smartsteem is much more preferable in vote-selling selection.

Welcome to the era of bots 我想 Steem 现在的机器人盛世是创办人当初所预想不到的吧？从前是大鱼海豚小鱼之间互相点赞（好啦我知道大鱼只跟大鱼玩啦），到现在是大家都把 SP 出租给机器人，作者们想要赞就只好去跟机器人买啦。 不信我？还是想买赞却不知去哪里可以找到机器人？简单，去随便一个热门 Tag 下点开人任意一篇文章，看看点赞的名单，通常靠前几个就是卖赞的机器人们。 别误会，我并没有丝毫反对还是贬低机器人的意思。相反，我本身就是Smartsteem 的忠实用户，因为我知道这是个直接有力的推广内容方式。 至今我对 Steem 还是很乐观的，毕竟可以看到这样的划时代自由市场一直随着时间演化也是一大趣事。 欢迎来到机器人盛世 Claim free coins from these Airdrops VERIME ETU CloudBounce Vyper Cryptokami Kelta Echarge Blok This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Welcome to the era of bots 欢迎来到机器人盛世’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/welcome-to-the-era-of-bots/"},{"title":"How to make your Kindle ad-free, for free!","text":"I have a Kindle Paperwhite for about 2 years. Bought it from Amazon during Amazon Day where they would normally provide a huge discount on this flagship product. Mine was deducted from $119 to $89, with special offer. Whats is special offer?It is a way that Amazon try their best to beautify ‘Advertisement’. So yeah, with special offer is a Kindle come with advertisement built-in with a lower price. If you hate to be greeted with a page of ads every time unlocking your Kindle, buy one without special offer. And the price difference could be obvious. Pay extra $20 premium and you get a permanently ad-free Kindle. But does it worth the premoum? If you are intended to use it with flip cover protection case, ad-free is a must have option I would say. What if you can make Kindle ad-free without the hefty premium?Here is how I did it. I bought a Kindle ‘with special offer’ straight from Amazon US and had it shipped to Singapore. And let’s do the trick: First you will have to get you Amazon account ready, the same account will be used for Kindle login as well. Make sure you insert a foreign country address in it. Login Kindle with the same account. Inside the account page you will see a new Kindle is added in the device list. Open up Amazon customer live chat support. Now you get a support officer online, let’s cast the magic: Tell him you are not located in US and the ‘special offer’ of Kindle is useless to you, ask if he could remove it for free. They will then verify your location and gladly take away the advertisement from their end. It took less than 2 minutes for me to end the chat with success. Say thank you and enjoy your ad-free Kindle! So the trick is mainly base on the kindness of Amazon customer service with top notch flexibility. Mine was becoming ad-free 2 years ago and there is no sign of any ads coming back. This trick should works on all kind of Kindle but not limited to Paperwhite series only. If you are planning to get one, get the advertisement version and try this trick, you can always upgrade to ad-free by paying the $20 premium just in case it won’t works. If you already have one and tired with the annoying first page ads, you are ready to get it off for free. Share with me if the trick works for you. Kindle 有两个版本，就是有广告和没有的。两者价格上的差别是 $20，对基础价格大约 $119 来说，其实是挺贵的。但是对有广告过敏症的人来说，有一个无广告的清新版 Kindle 是人生一大快事。 我来教你如何免费去除广告首先你要有一个广告版的 Kindle，然后身在外国。用同样的 Amazon 户口登录设备，户口里登记的地址必须是外国。然后就上 Amazon US 客服的在线服务，跟他们说: “我人在国外，美国的广告对我无用，我也无法从这里消费，可以帮我移除吗？”他们核实你的地址后就会免费并永久的把广告从你的设备清除。 所以，那些想入手 Kindle 的请买广告版，那些有广告版 Kindle 的先别谢我，赶紧去试试吧。 Claim free coins from these Airdrops VERIME ETU CloudBounce Vyper Cryptokami Kelta Echarge Blok This page is synchronized from the post: ‘How to make your Kindle ad-free, for free!’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/how-to-make-your-kindle-ad-free-for-free/"},{"title":"First DIY desktop PC building experience and I'm satisfied","text":"Build my current PC rig more than half a year ago which was a huge upgrade from my precious performance laptop.

Although I convert the 6kg laptop combination to this desktop rig which could be as heavy as 25ky combining all the peripherals including the 12kg speaker, I never look back for a moment.

If you are geek enough you might already the rig is missing a very important component. Yes, the true essence of a performance rig, the Graphic card! At the time of building this rig, GPU is too overpriced for the exploding crypto mining demand. And that overpricing trend continues till today, that’s why my PC is still running on a low-end GPU just for the sake of providing video output. Total cost of CPU + peripheral equals to SGD 2283 as of now without GPU. Which could become a rig worth of SGD 3000 in the final form. Never expected I would build a 3k rig nor I could expect to have such privilege to own a desktop PC this expensive. This is a note for my first rig building conclusion.

I even wrote a post to promote some of them. All the airdrop coins that I’ve been referring requires zero investment and are pretty straight-forward. There are tons and tons of new ICO coming up and use airdropping as the marketing strategy. So it is almost impossible to track all of them down wishing to participate into all airdrops. I just taking part in some of them just for the fun and you can never know what would happen to these coins in the future. These crazy wave of airdrops reminds me somethingAs I mentioned in the previous post, almost all of the new projects that running airdrops are base on Ethereum. That being said, Ether(ETH) is already in huge demand as all the ERC20 tokens will need it to process transactions. To make this observation further base on the fact that ICO will only grow more in 2018, decentralized platform projects will grow along definitely. Impossibility to predict which ICO will have the final successWhile you will use all kind of benchmark like team background, execution ability or technologies to judge the possibility of which new projects will stand out eventually, it is not hard to admit that we still can’t be sure of what things will become in the future. However, platforms that support the sea of ICO certainly have a brighter future.Coins like Ethereum, NEO, Cardano, EOS and the similar will always be the hotbed of ICO at least for 2018. As the infrastructure getting more mature it is almost irresistible not to use the ready-made service to issue new coins and crowdfunding for new projects. By doing so the new coin can directly share the existing crowd of a particular decentralized platform while do not have to worry about technical troubles of the blockchain, they will have more time to deal with other issues. Overall, hosting new coin on decentralized platform is a win-win situation for both sides as it creates a virtuous cycle. Stumbled upon this wall art in the Cloud Forest Dome Singapore, reminding me very much of a crypto logo. Do you know which one? 最近铺天盖地的 ICO 着实令人吃惊，看来 2018 会是各种新 ICO 的爆发年。这也是我从最近各式各样的货币空投活动所发现的趋势，还有一个更重要的的走势就是，现在绝大多数的 ICO 都是建立在 ETH 平台上，所以 ETH 地址是参与空投活动的必备条件之一。 这也提醒了我，既然 ICO 几乎确定了是会继续红火下去的事实，那么为何不投资在好像 ETH 般提供孵化新货币的去中心化温床呢？类似的项目还有熟悉的 EOS，Cardano，NEO，等等。 在如海潮般的 ICO 里要挑出最后的赢家难度很可能真的象大海捞针一般，对我来说，投资在新项目们的孵化中心会是更明智的选择。 上图是我昨日在新加坡的室内云雾森林所拍摄，墙上的艺术形态像极了某加密货币的图标，你猜得出来吗？ Claim free coins from these Airdrops ETU NAS CloudBounce Vyper Apollo Cryptokami Kelta Lendo Blok NEOCash This page is synchronized from the post: ‘These crazy wave of airdrops reminds me something’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/these-crazy-wave-of-airdrops-reminds-me-something/"},{"title":"You wished to buy more cheap Steem when it was $9, wish granted. 回到解放前","text":"Woohooo, seems like I’m heading back where I’ve started in Steem when it was just about $1.

Isn’t this like a dream come true?Wishing to study more after you failed that subject, hoping you could go back to fix those mistakes so that girl can come back to your arms. But none of these really happens, time doesn’t go back. However, those wishes about “I wish I could buy more” that you made when the crypto market hit its ATH at 800B market cap few months back, are about to come true with the current downtrend.

You are not, most of us don’t. We are so well-programmed that we tend to be happy when our investment grow in value and despair when they decline. Even to a die-hard crypto believer like myself, although I knew this crash means everything about great opportunity to buy more, unconsciously deep in my mind I feel uneasy about the overall market situation. Often I can’t help but panic a little every time I see the market total cap falls to week-low or month-low value.

It is the simplest form of editor yet the most powerful one amongst the minimalistic editor. It supports tons of languages to the extent that some old-school coder even uses it to program and debug. Definitely full mark for its plain text and programming language friendliness. Now comes to the auto-save part. Set it up by Setting-Preference-Backup. Tick the Enable session snapshot and periodic backup and you can even set the backup interval. Auto-save solved. The simplest way to make your note available on all your devices is using the help of free cloud storage like Google Drive. First use Backup and Sync to mount Google Drive to local PC file system. After that, all you have to do is save the note file in the directory where has the link to Google Drive. Whatever created or modified under your Google Drive folder will be instantly synced to the cloud.

Followers?Do the 10k followers matter if 99.9% of them are dead account? You can too achieve this amazing army of fans by using a bot to follow 1000 plankton users every day and anyhow a few of them will follow you back.

Reputation, post payouts, comment number and votes amount. Almost all of it can be controlled by bots, to be more precise, vote-selling bot. Not being disrespectful here but those elements are just not the things to look for in hunting a popular user. So what to look for instead? In my opinion, it must be the underrated View Count! Steem is one of the pioneer projects to monetize content creation that everyone keeps their focus on how to game the system to maximize profit, that they ignoring the ultimate goal of creating content – to attract as much attention as possible. I understand there are several front-end like steemit.com, busy.org, and the language-specific site like cnsteem.com. Traffic to the same content would be diversified as each individual sites only can keep the view count locally. Nonetheless, it should not be the reason to overlook the importance of this parameter. It is easy to hit $20 for the payout with help of voting bots while the total view count is just 9. I would rather my hard work could reach 100 pairs of eyes while scoring payout with only $2. A great content creator could grab a bunch of readers, but those readers might not always holding high SP. I must not be alone in such mindset. Steemit.com is the only site to keep track of view count But all it does is just providing a number on each of the posts and that’s it. There is no way in the author homepage or post list that you can have an overview of average view or total page view kind of things with ease. Because it doesn’t matter very much in the world of Steem remember? View count doesn’t affect payout, powerful vote does. Guess this is why no one bothers to care about this parameter much rather than those gameable value. But view counting is nothing more than a child’s play nowIt now works as “+1 per click on the link”. With automated scripts or bots anyone could easily bump up the view count of course, but it won’t be happening until view count actually becomes a thing of Steem. Til then, the site owner can easily define and limit the invalid traffic. Look for the view countSo next time when you decided to check if someone is actually having a huge crowd of audience, open a few of his recent posts and check on the view count. It might not be telling the whole truth but at least it has a certain reference value. Do not be surprised if some superstars with 10,000 followers averaging just about 3 view count per post.

And the image portion of old post will forever stay blank, tragic. In the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, decentralization is key. We decided to switch to our own distributed image hosting solution. It aims to be an alternative to our previous image hosting which was centralized and costly (Cloudinary). In short, IPFS makes all the upload image on Busy stored in multiple locations in chunks. Single point of failure is eliminated. Our images have never been more secured on Steem. Just in case if you are not aware, @dtube is using IPFS for the video storing as well. If you are interested to know more this amazing technology, visit the Official IPFS site and maybe give it a read of the whitepaper. Busy.org 已经变成了我日常必来的 Steem 网页，我们姑且不论它比大哥 steemit 其他优胜的地方（UI实在是好看好用太多），就说以下两点功能已经足以让我离不开它： 终于有免费方便的 Notification 可看 终于可以一站式知道谁回复了，谁关注了，谁转发了，谁转钱了。作为社交网站这个最基本的功能居然由第三方的 Busy 搞定，Steemit 你惭不惭愧？ 上传的图片使用 IPFS 保存 低价，高效，去中心化的网络，图片若干年后丢失的可能性大大降低。dtube 也是使用 IPFS 保存视频哦。 Claim free coins from these Airdrops ETU NAS CloudBounce Vyper Apollo BitSong Kelta Lendo Blok NEOCash This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Busy.org is the best Steem site for two reasons’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/busy-org-is-the-best-steem-site-for-two-reasons/"},{"title":"A conversation with a scammer","text":"Recently I was in a Telegram ICO group for a particular project, asking some technical questions for the admins to answer. This has become a norm for almost all ICO have their official Telegram channel to interact with the public. This very ICO group is quite famous that it has over 37k members in it, some of the ‘safety admins’ constantly repeating some anti-scammer message saying the true admins will not direct messaging the members. And I bumped into oneI guess I was targeted after making a few appearances by asking questions. I knew immediately this is a scammer when he first messaged me. He was using the photo and name of one of the admins in the Telegram group. A simple reverse tracking can clearly tell he was a fake. I was in the playful mood this morning and I decided to see how he plays his tricks on the victims. &lt;img src=“(https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUFLM7zKYCwmgY75SbBqd4F5Zc9QcLYpWvZqpKjjsqRh2“ /&gt; Blockchain account. Pffffttttt. I almost couldn’t hold my laughter. He cannot even get the crypto glossaries correct. Or maybe the victims are usually less educated so he has to use the conventional concept for bait the fish easier? Finally he provided the real deal, his ETH address. I took a look at it at ethscan.io, zero balance with an empty record. Fresh address. To make him more greedy, I even suggest that I could invest 300 more ETH that I wish I have. But damn, this man is somewhat a kind-hearted scammer that he would just take the 50 ETH deal! Scammer examination time, not bad of a reaction from him. I would give an A for that answer. Here comes the second exam, the technical round. While he still busying proving his genuineness. OK, he used the “dragging” tactic for the first question, not bad. What about one more technical question? He seems like panicked a little bit and gave me some confusing answers which are conflicting with one another. And he got annoyed obviously. Thus trying to steer the focus away and urge me to ‘invest’. Too bad my works kick in and I have to end this game. God this man was scamming around without even reading up the Whitepaper. Also he claimed he made millions by scamming this way, not sure how true about this statement. If it is not a lie, I’d be the more qualified scammer, damn. 今天在 Telegram 遇到个骗子，刚巧有兴致我就和他玩了一下。有兴趣的就去看看上面的截图吧。最后谨记，在虚拟世界你看到的不一定是真实的，时刻怀疑一切才是王道。 Claim free coins from these Airdrops ETU NAS CloudBounce Vyper Apollo BitSong Kelta Lendo Blok NEOCash This page is synchronized from the post: ‘A conversation with a scammer’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/a-conversation-with-a-scammer/"},{"title":"Don't walk on the street naked anymore","text":"Do you care about your online privacy?

Maybe you are not Okay with all the listed traciking activities upon you, but unfortunately those trackings happens all the time in the backend that ordinary user would not even notice. How do you feel if someone keeps peeping at you? Comparing our real-life and Internet-life could be funny. Imagine the following scene: You are having a leisure window-shopping walk in a mall, a brand new Nike sneaker behind display windows get your attention that you spent a few glances at it and then walk away. Soon, one or two sales persons pop up out of nowhere promoting sport sneakers to you, because they have been lurking in the dark corner tracking what your shopping behaviour. What would you do to the sales person? Undoubtedly, you turn down the offer and dismiss them irritatically realizing how they sneaking behind you and observe the trails you left behind.

This mindset is as wrong as “It’s Okay I can live in a house without walls because I’m not a star.”. We do not value our privacy much in the World Wide Web because we don’t see the way to cash it, which is what Google does best while building a kingdom of advertisement. Let’s say you have no problem with the commercial part, exposing everything online might put one in a danger place if some ill-purposed parties have some interest in exploiting the naked sheep. Furtheremore, in the coming era of cryptocurrencies, network privacy has never been so vital when everyone is literally running its own bank. You know how to harden the defence online first before investing in the crypto, not the other way round. Network security will be one of the fundamental classes in the future primary school.

MoxyOne aims to provide a seamless infrastructure for cryptocurrency company/team to allow their user in order to spend tokens. For new ICO or existing crypto company that are widely spread over different niches other than payment system, they will have to invest extra resources and effort to develop in-house payment channel for the end-user to utilize their tokens. By white labelling MoxyOne wallet system, the partner company can now skip all the unnecessary cost to offer debit cards to the public. For end-users like us, we can now convert our cryptocurrency to fiat instantly no matter it is making a purchase at a shop or even withdraw fiat from an ATM. What about MoxyOne vs its competitors?We know Monaco and TenX are the biggest players in the field but there is something exclusively offered by MoxyOne. That is the ability to whitelist ICOs or existing crypto teams to allow their users spending the tokens in real life. Furthermore, with MoxyOne JITF(Just-In-Time Funding) protocol, users don’t have to reload the card with crypto like the competitor’s prepaid card model. This not only would avoid unnecessary losses if the card went missing, but the overall payment process is seamlessly smooth. What is MoxyAI?MoxyAI is another killer feature that helps users to spend their tokens with best-value at the time of sale. Let’s say user have BTC and ETH in the cards and would like to buy a cup of coffee while BCH goes down 10% and ETH spike to 15% at that point of time, MoxyAI will suggest to using ETH for the payment instead of the default currency BTC. MoxyAI will always choose the best performing tokens for best possible value in a transaction. Buy low sell high remember? What is the token for MoxyOne?SPEND is the token that will mainly responsible for individual transactions and transactions fee. It was not designed for buy and hold but SPEND is meant to fuel the whole MoxyOne payment system. As all transactions will incur negligible fees in term of SPEND, this healthy circulation of SPEND tokens will become a valuable asset and we can the value to grow over time. Token Abbreviation: SPEND Token Name: Spend Hard Cap (Maximum Supply): 50, 000, 000 SPEND Token Network: Ethereum (ERC20 extended) Emission Rate No new coins will ever be created after token sale end How will the SPEND value grows? As every transaction using the MoxyOne system are required to pay a negligible fee in SPEND including: Liquid provider need to acquire 100,000 SPEND to partner with MoxyOne User needs to get some SPEND for transaction fee. ICO or exchanges partners need to acquire minimum amount of SPEND for partnership. Demand over SPEND as the fule of MoxyOne will only go up over time as the project expands. Did MoxyOne establish any partnership with third parties already? Crypto companies like Sociall, Gladius, eBitcoin, FLUX, Invox Finance, and zero-fee exchange Cobinhood has already be MoxyOne partners, and the list is growing. Amazing marketing effort for a project that is still in the ICO phase I would say! Why participating in MoxyOne ICO now?You gain extra 10% of SPEND tokens before 15 April 2018 01:00 UTC. 1 ETH is priced at 1000 SPEND in the ICO. With that said, investing 1 ETH would get you total 1100 SPEND, not bad at all! When will I get the SPEND tokens?Distribution of SPEND is programmed using smart contract and it is immediate upon every ETH send in. Use ethscan.io to check address balances. Whats is the minimum goal of this ICO?MoxyOne ICO has a soft cap of 4000 ETH which all the collected ETH will be refunded to contributors if the soft cap is not met upon the ICO completion.

Such behaviour usually initiated by new or minnow user, but what about the normal users who have invested some SP and carry some voting weight? They rather self-vote their comment than my postThese people would normally read through your whole post and leave some comments that make sense, which is great. Then they would self-vote their comment with full force which I’m totally fine with it too. But when I go through my post’s vote list and I found no trace of him upvoting even for 1%, that is what gives me a complicated feeling. How do I interpret such action?If someone finished my 3-minute long article and leave no sign of appreciation(upvote or resteem), but upvote his own one-line comment with full power. To me that could only mean one thing, he wants to tell me that my post is actually shittier than his comment. Of course, comment self-voting can have other meanings as well. For example that he might want to pin his comment at the top to raise more visibility. Or he just wants to make sure the author read his comment, or whatever. As the post author, I don’t feel good upon such action anyhow. Sir, just gotta let you know your content sucks. My comment would worth more! Sure, I know they self-vote just for the profitI’m old enough on the Steem platform to correctly analyse such action, most of them are just rather reap all the return generated by their SP than giving it away to the authors. Everyone has the right to do what they want with their vote, I have no problem with it at all. But if everything were solely for making greater profit, do me a favour: Sell your vote or delegate all SP to the SmartSteem. By doing so, Definitely you get higher return without the shame of self-voting. You can save all the hassle of commenting and self-voting. You can stop disgust the authors unintentionally. Author will have the peace of mind now. Looking from the wider perspective, this is the perfect alternative way to downvote a post. You use the voting power to self-vote instead of wasting it to downvote the post which you think has less value than your comment. In this way, you successfully conveying the message that the content is subpar yet get rewarded, by you. Win-win! (use this trick with caution though) 有没有见过某些读者拜读完你的文章以后，留言后大力给自己点赞，然后就扬长而去，你的文章就伫立在寒风中一脸问号。这样的做法意味着什么？对我来说只有一种意思，那就是老子寥寥数字的留言写得比你800字的文章都要好！ 当然事故如我，其实很清楚这种行为其实只是为了盈利，宁愿把自己的 SP 盈利来回归自己的口袋都不给作者。这是无可厚非的，别人也无权过问的。但要是单纯是为了盈利，请帮帮忙这样做： 卖赞或干脆把全部 SP 租给SmartSteem. 这样一来， 回酬肯定比点赞自己来的更高。 不用烦心每次留言自己点赞，省时省力。 不再需要老是恶心周围的人。 作者的小小心灵不会受到伤害。 话说回来，我似乎发现了什么？这难道不是替代 Downvote 的另一种更棒的方法？当发现某篇文章写得太烂，与其把 VP 浪费在 Downvote，还不如留个言点个赞，恶心作者的同时还有钱收，双赢啊！(请小心使用此伎俩) Take part in the MoxyOne ICO now!

And soon I realised there is a huge barrier between me and those games. Most of them are not compatible with Windows 10Now I can understand why some of my hard-core gamer friends are still reluctant to upgrade to Win 10 from Win 7 as it as better compatibility to old 32-bit games. Not only I could not install some of the old games on the my Win 10 PC, most of them running in weird resolution and do not allow to run in windowed mode. That could simply spell disaster. I have to find an alternative or else I have to kiss-goodbye to the goodies that used to bring me much happiness. Virtual machine solves all the problems!There are couple of benefits that make running old games on VM is the best idea ever: No more compatibility issues as you can just install any OS that suit the games. We can choose to install any OS that suits the game. While old games image are usually extracted and consolidated by strangers on the Internet, we do not know if the image is maliciously infected. Running games on a VM could eliminate all the worries as the host OS is not affected. Full screen of windowed mode gaming, it’s all up to you! How do I set it up? I decided to go with Windows XP as it is old enough to host all the retro games while being one of the most reputable Windows series. Here is the name of best Windows XP variant, en_windows_xp_professional_with_service_pack_3_x86_cd_vl_x14-73974.iso which you can download from here. Next step is to get a Virtual machine, I use the simple yet powerful VirtualBox. There are plenty of guides online or you can just follow this one. Make sure you enable the Install Guest Additions inside the VM for a seamless experience. I would say this is a must do step for all VirtualBox user as this trick will make the VM run as another app in the host OS without any delay and lag. You can discover more tips on this VM by following this guide. Depending on what games you want to install, since most retro games are extracted in ISO form, you will need a Daemon Tools Lite installed as well. You should be all set after following all the step above now. Happy Gaming!

I’ve actively created around 20 pieces of art during my days on the platform. All of them were the entries for various art contests and I’ve blessed that most of them were the winners!

So I decided to set up a websiteMainly for hosting and showcasing purpose. Never setting up one before and too lazy to pick up the learning curve, I go with the easiest option – Wix. No need to get a domain, database and server and whatsoever. All the user need to do is register an account, pick a web styyle and start uploading content onto it. Wix basically got you covered in everything. I wanted to keep everything simple and easy. Chose a theme that host all my works on the homepage with two columns and I find it looks really good since I have different size and ratio of entries. Scroll the way down to see all the photos. I’ve put on some details on the About page just to explain my attitude about art a little. Included email, and Discord as the way of contacting me as well. I understand that using one-stop website solution like Wix might not be the sustainable way if things are getting serious. For example, this free package comes with a very limited bandwidth for traffic. And the feature are quite limited on customizing the site even with premium package. But I guess that will serve the my purpose for now. Here is the URL if you would like to pay a visit: https://fr3eze.wixsite.com/artspace 尽管 Steem 作为是很好的展示内容创作的平台，但是对于集中性的收集帖子方面，前端网站们做的不是很好，没有提供一个类似相簿的功能。我决定做个网站来专门收集和展示以往在这里所创作过的艺术作品。由于不想（懒惰）去学习新的知识技术，我走了最快的网站建立捷径，那就是 Wix！ 网站设计的主题我追求的是简单明了。在主页上就能把我所有的作品通过拉下的操作一览无遗，在 About 页面还加了点关于我对艺术创作的态度和联络方式。 虽然省却了很多麻烦，但要是以后要认真把网站搞起来的话，Wix 不会是长久之计。目前作为单纯收集的用途还是可以应付得来的。网址是： https://fr3eze.wixsite.com/artspace 流量有限，请不要频繁浏览，哈哈哈。 Take part in the MoxyOne ICO now!

The reason was unknown as no one could ever link correctly the price trend to any crypto events. Some said it was due to the awesome update of Hivemind, some said this is a usual bounce after such a hard crash. None of it matters in fact, the question we all should care about is, How can we benefit from this price spiking?Yes we can, and it could be as much as the increment of Steem price we see today. To understand how this trick works we first have to understand how is Steem blockchain calculating the actual feed price. It is not based on the current market price but using the average price of last 3.5 days. You can simply calculate the feed_price by Steem Power/Estimated Account Value, or make use of the SteemTools developed by @justyy. As of now, the feed price is $1.5, let’s say Steem will maintain at $2 for the next 3.5 days. This feed price will slowly increase to $2 after one week. So what does this mean?Our post payout solely depends on the feed_price as well. Still couldn’t get it? Gather all the votes you can from vote-selling site like SmartSteem on your recent post. Sit back and chill while watching the value of the post growing. You can buy votes from other bots but make sure to choose those with positive ROI. For example, if you are able to get $10 of votes today while the feed_price is $1.5. After half a week your post will be valued 33% more at $13.33 as feed_price catch up to $2. Of course everything comes with risksHere are the few assumptions that must happen for this trick to work: Steem market price has to be maintained at least higher than $1.5 level. Vote buying ROI cannot be negative or else it would eat up the profit. This trick works best if you already have Steem and SBD on hand to spend. Even if you decided to buy some hot Steem for the post-pumping, it doesn’t hurt much as a true Steem believer for this trick to fail because you just adding more power to the investing position! 今天的 Steem 狂飙车想必大家已经知晓，确实的原因也没人能说得上来。但没关系，毕竟上来就已经是好事。真正应该问的问题是，我们能从这一波猛涨里额外获益吗？ 可以的！前提是你要知道 Steem 体系如何计算 feed_price, 那就是使用最近 3.5 天的平均价。而我们的帖子收入也是根据这个喂价上下波动，目前尽管市价已经升到 $2，但是均价还是在 $1.5 左右。 什么？还是 get 不到？你要做的就是极尽所能的集合所有的赞，比如从 SmartSteem 那里买赞给自己最新的帖子。然后就坐等看着帖子收益慢慢上升吧。 以今天的均价买赞，要是 3.5 天以后市价都可以维持在 $2 ，帖子收益就会上升 33%！今天价值 $10 的帖子半个星期后会变成 $13.33 哦！ 当然没有什么事稳赚不赔的这个旁门左道要生效的话有两大前提：Steem 市价在未来 3.5 天起码要高于 $1.5, 和你获得赞的回报率不可为负数。 当然这旁门左道就算失败了，对真正在 Steem 有信仰的人来说也没什么，就当作是一次低价买入咯！ Take part in the MoxyOne ICO now!

Nobody can make sure whether he did invest in the ICO that he backed, but I’m sure his pockets are full of cash for the ‘advertisement’ service.

People even start making bots to track his tweet and automatically buy the tokens hoping the catch the McAfee effect. How tweets are created We turn down over 90% of all companies wanting to buy our services. The reason is that only products and services that Mr.McAfee truly believes in will be promoted. These are products or services that Mr.McAfee has personally purchased or used and is pleased enough with to engage in promotions, or ICOs whose white paper describes a vision in line with Mr.McAfee’s vision and the company producing it has passed our thorough audit.– McAfee Crypto Team Yeah, it means that project owners cannot secure a partnership with Mr.Midas Touch just because they can afford the 100k fee. Their projects have to be to genuinely valuable or at least believed by McAfee himself, which makes the tweet promotion sounds like a real solid recommendation. To follow McAfee tweet’s promotion or not?For short-term traders, maybe. This is just another pump-and-dump game where speed is the key. The early you get to react to the tweet and buy in before price being pumped, the higher the chance you are going to make money from it. However for long term investor, this might not be the good idea. Although the McAfee team claims that they only promote projects that have a genuine value and turns down most of the offer they received, nobody can verify that claim but the team itself.

EOS 很凑巧的在我昨天建议检查 ETH 地址登记之后就爆发了 40%，具体原因不清楚，但这就让检查更重要了，因为更值钱了啊。搞不好六月一号之后全都不见了恐怕会去撞墙。 种种因素比如“把一切去中心化”的口号，长达一年的奇葩 ICO，神人 Dan 的加持，还有 Github 最活跃之一的活动量等，都把还未出世的 EOS 变成了 Top 5。 未来越来越精彩了。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘EOS the top 5 coin!’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/eos-the-top-5-coin/"},{"title":"Steem is telling the jackpot result in advance again","text":"Hail to the great Steem soared all the way to $3 as all of you must have already noticed if you are a loyal subscriber of CMC like me (well, it might not be as I bet tons of your feeds on Steem were talking about this price spiking as well).

If not, we will still be able to benefit from it thanks to the 3.5 days delayed feed_price which you can refer how to do it at: How to actually hack the price spiking of Steem? The other useful tip is to make use of Steem Plus if you are a regular steemit user on Chrome. Under the wallet there is a new price indicator for your holdings using current market rate.

I’ve posted days ago about how to validate ETH address registration with EOS but realise there is one more important issue to verify. Image source After EOS registration user will receive an EOS key pair that consists of a public and private key. This key pair is useless until 1st June the EOS blockchain is finally established. The abovementioned method can validate the ETH address that temporarily stores the EOS as ERC20 tokens will be snapshot at the launch day. Upon the establishment of EOS network, user will need to use the EOS private key to access their EOS as those funds will be moved from ETH network to the new one. Paranoid investor like me will have a real worry now, how to verify the EOS private key is valid before the mainnet? Offline tool to verify your EOS private key and mapping to public keyThis is a great tool I’ve found in Github: https://github.com/webdigi/EOS-Offline-Private-key-check This is a simple tool to verify EOS private key by generating the public key using a web browser. Take note that I did my verification in Google Chrome as Internet Explorer failed me. And the instruction is simple: Steps to running this tool with peace of mind! Turn your device offline. This page will work without an internet connection. Paste your EOS private key and then click on “Map to EOS public key” Your EOS private key and corresponding public key will show up. All done! You can close this page and then turn on internet connection :) You may generate a random EOS key pair to test this tool before using the real key. Testing result of an example key pair Overall steps to verify your EOS is properly ready for launching day Register ETH address that is used to store EOS, refer this guide for MyEtherWallet. User receive a EOS key pair. Use this guide to make sure ETH address is registered with EOS. It requires the user to provide ETH address and return with a EOS public address which has to be in match with the EOS pubic key user received in Step 1. Use the offline tool to verify EOS private key. The generated EOS public key has to be same as the EOS pubic key user received in Step 1 as well. These steps are crucial if the user were to store EOS inside private wallet. Failing to do so might risk your access to the EOS you have bought after mainnet was launched after 1st June.

Mainly created art for contest purpose, I figured that record the process would actually help in several ways: It could be another new content in video form. So I can post it in dTube in a seperate post. It could serve the educational purpose by showing the audience all the detailed step that happends in the process. Better documentation for future self-referencing. While I do the drawing most of the time on my computer desk, I have to improvise the camera setup every time before starting the art creation. Just to end up spending too much time trying to test new camera setup method and to improve the previous setup. The setup processes less fun over time and it just depletes my motivation on starting a new art drawing. I need some fixed setup and it has to work! Overhead camera rig building First I prepared some pre-measured PVC parts which I got from local hardware shop for less than 10 SGD. The longest tube is 30cm and shortest is 10cm. This can be varies base on your working environment. Connect the tubes up with the connectors. No need to use glue here as the connection will be tight enough if you put enough strength. Also flexibility and modularity can be kept for future modification. Xiaoyi 4k action camera and the Joby gorillapod action tripod was the old and main gear that used to improvised with various tools for previous art recording. The camera rig is almost finished now. Fits just nice in the available space of my desktop. Hang the action camera from the extended tube and we are ready to do. I put a sketchbook under the rig just for effect illustration. This is by far the best setup that free me from worrying how to set the camera angle nice enough to capture everything that is happening on the table. The only drawback was I can work on the camera connection better by just hanging it like that as it will still swing a little subject to movement, but that would work for now. Things now look cool and definitely working! 加入 Steem 以来重新开始了画画之旅，由于年前入手了小蚁运动相机，也决定物尽其用开始拍摄绘画过程。那么一次绘画就会有起码可以产生两个内容，以后有时间还可以编辑好了发在 dTube 上。但一直以来最头痛的问题就是拍摄工具搭建方式。由于没有固定的设立方式，每次开始绘画之前总得折腾一番，运动相机和三脚架的结合适合出外使用，在桌上固定拍摄却不是那么回事了。所以渐渐这也消磨了我绘画的热情，好在终于想出了一个好方法，那就是 DIY 自建一个相机架，使用的是平常用作水管的 PVC 管。 效果还真的很不错，而且价格非常廉宜，最重要的是完全可以依照自己的需求和环境限制搭建，还不需要额外的工具。这就画起来吧！ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Overhead camera rig DIY with PVC tubes’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/overhead-camera-rig-diy-with-pvc-tubes/"},{"title":"Drawing Goku 悟空 | 齐白石杯 月旦评","text":"This artwork took me 5 hours, the longest I’ve been done in the recent drawing.

Forecasters making prediction base on the questions generated by the system and to be rated according to the prediction accuracy. Cindicator offers the platform for forecasters to predict both the crypto and traditional market. I will discuss why it is a good idea to start predicting as market analyst using this application and I would only share my insight on the crypto part in this post as I only making investments in this field. Snapshot source Forecasting skill is essentialFirst of all, I assume all the readers of this post are the crypto-person or at least possessing some fundamental understanding what is cryptocurrency, what is the must-do task for a crypto person on a daily basis? Checking tokens price. Image source Coinmarketcap.com is the most popular choice that it would become one of the most visited sites not long after participating in the crypto space. It is undeniable there are many more interesting aspects regardless the crypto price itself, like the blockchain variants, implementation of trustless transaction system and how all these ground-breaking technologies are going to change our lives. We can talk about these all day. But the fact is, we are here because most of us care about the price more than anything else. Especially some real money has been invested in it and making the crypto officially part of the assets. We’ve heard so much of the earlier Bitcoin success story that we hope this new digital investment asset could be the next best place to quadruple our capital. We trading and investing in cryptocurrencies so much that we try to grab all the news and information about projects we care for only one purpose, to be profited against the BTC or fiats. To day traders, they go in the long position in the hope of bullish run and turn to short call in the bear market. To long-term hodlers, short-term price fluctuation doesn’t impact much but they still anticipating the right timing to enter or quit the market nonetheless. In the other words, we constantly forecasting the price trending of coins. So it is safe to conclude that crypto investors practising the habit of an analyst. Do what you are already doing Image source In the discovery of Cindicator app, I thought this project was tailor-made for people like me. As I already spend most of my spare time observing this highly volatile space, all I have to do to take part in Cindicator is just answering the forecast questions without further studying. This would not take more than 5 minutes every day. I treat this as a tiny game as any quick mobile games would have taken longer than that. Sometimes it could be on the bus commuting to work, short tea break in the afternoon, or a couple of minutes before the bedtime. Not to forget that Cindicator is not all about making forecasts on the crypto topic only, but the traditional market occupies up the other half of it. If you are already reading the newspaper and catching up with the world news, you may be able to make a confident prediction on a various social topic like the election outcome of some countries. There are questions for stocks, precious metals like gold and silvers as well. One can only make prediction based on the questions generated by the system while the range is sort of limited at the beginning phase, analyst gets a broader range of question as the system matures. Forecasters can be rewarded Image source As of now, there is 1.25 BTC worth of prize for the crypto market and $7500 for the traditional market to be won every month. I will talk more about the BTC price as I solely taking part in the crypto market prediction only. Cindicator distributes to the 1.25 BTC every month to all the contributors with positive points propositionally. Theoretically, every contributor could earn a tiny split of the prize pool with even 1 point. This is the spreadsheet for February 2018 Crypto Market prize list where you can find all the contributors with a positive score. From the spreadsheet, we can tell that in the February round Martin Lawrence was the top winner at rank 1 with 5071 points that he could get away with 0.05787042917 BTC while scrolling down to the bottom where you can see a dozen of participants with the lowest rank of 10953 by 1 points and they still able to get 0.000003734820723 BTC each. One thing to take note, participants get the rewards in term of ETH with the equivalent amount of BTC. Also, it takes to posses of accumulation of at least 0.02 ETH in the account in order to withdraw it to own ETH wallet. My result as a casual forecaster in the first monthIt was a generous 0.02104335 ETH (roughly 18 USD) for the rank of 103th in the February run which you can verify in the spreadsheet above. Well, you might say 18 USD might be mediocre to most but it is good enough for merely a bonus. What motivates me the most was the recognization of my prediction skills (or guessing skill you might want to call it haha) to be ranked almost in the top 100 out of 10k predictors. Out of my surprise, that prize comes in a package that I was entiled to one month of Beginner plan to receive processed event indicators from Cindicator that would require a total possession of 5,000 CND. That would allow me to access the result of crowd intelligence and maybe trade accordingly if I want. My Cindicator wallet page Snapshot from spreadsheet I’ve no finance background nor possess any analytical skills. I make prediction base on my understanding of the crypto market since the day I started to invest 1 year ago. The first month is already a thrilling experience for me. After all, these rewards were just more than enough for doing something I was already doing and just requires 5 minutes of my time every day which I could just spend away in a few Bejeweled games. Things can work in bidirection Image source When I first get to know about Cindicator, the first impression is that user is the engine to power up this project. We feed tremendous forecast and prediction for the hybrid intelligence infrastructure to process and finally produce some useful indicators. Analysts then get rewarded base on our accuracy point by the system. Intelligence is exchanged for financial reward under this model. It is easy to come to a conclusion that Cindicator will not survive if no one ever wanted to participate in it anymore. Only the participants can empower the system in a one-way direction. It is not true. When I was making my first forecast about Bitcoin event, I noticed there will be some helpful links beside the question. Those are links providing crucial information like candlestick chart, news and summary which could help the analyst in the decision-making process. Snapshot source I was quite surprised by the thoughtful design and will have a look at some of them sometimes and that’s when the magic happens. I actually learn something new every now and then, be it the new insight from communities or some new trading tactics. If it weren’t for the helpful links, I would have just completed all the questions and call it a day even if there is some trend I wasn’t really sure of. Prediction’s performance tracking tool Image source “Is Bitcoin going to achieve $50,000 mark at the end of 2018?” “Will Etheereum dethrone Bitcoin after implementation of Casper?” “Market is crashing so bad, is the bull getting near?” We make forecast every day on the market trend and some of us might answer to questions above which can be seen all over the social media. But how to judge the accuracy your calls are for these future events? You can make all the prediction either in your heart or in front of friends but chances are you will not remember how does your call turn out in the in the said future. Because we would not track something that was made out of instinct or wasn’t planned. To remember a bet, there is no better way than to actually put down the cold hard cash on it. You in the long position for Bitcoin? Buy some Bitcoin. Feeling bearish for gold market? Sell away your gold in the bank. Naturally, you will follow up all the upcoming event to verify all the trades that have been made. However, this method is not applicable to young, ordinary, and asset-less people like me. Cindicator offers a whole new opportunity to track what I’ve predicted without having to put my money at stake. All I have to do is just looking at the Statistic page where the score will tell how accurate I’m in the market predicting overall, and the rank shows how competitive I’m against all the other forecasters. Competition drives innovation Image source Competitiveness is one of human’s natures. That’s why we will keep trying to unlock the full three stars each stage in the Angry Bird. We want to top the leaderboard and better than all of our friends even if it was just a game. Cindicator is designed in a way to push analysts to compete with each other. Although it takes minor effort and no risk to take part, nobody would love to do something for nothing. Nobody wishes to end up in 5084th place and receives prizes equivalent to 24 cents after one month of work. The design of the ranking system and unique prize distribution model motivates everyone to compete and improve in a fair and open arena. We will not stop polishing our prediction ability and keep looking for the better way in order to improve the result. This will not only granting analysts the sharpness in the extremely volatile trading market but they will have theedge of a well-informed person for any upcoming events. A door to world of blockchain Image source Cryptocurrency is booming in 2017, a tremendous amount of new projects blooming in the space of blockchain targetting different niches from payment, ICO, to exchange, and storage. Hot projects in the market are mainly made for the technical developers, business owner but leaving ordinary people behind. You can’t just start living off Bitcoin or Litecoin without a great amount of inconvenience and you do not draft smart contract for day-to-day transactions. Cindicator offers easy access for anyone to hug the ground-breaking blockchain technology. The Analyst can start the prediction as simple as visiting web application or just download mobile application from Google Play Store or Apple Store. These apps are one of the finest crypto-based application I’ve seen in the market. UI was clean and the operation is sleek. Snapshot source Predicting in the crypto market the is compounding action to immerse one in the sea of cryptocurrencies. The more you learn the better the prediction, the better the prediction one will end up with bigger portion of the prize pool. This may be the best chance for a complete crypto newbie to score their first crypto token that actually worth something, and that could be as easy as earn one point and grab that 0.00001 ETH. Cindicator is the best starting point for anyone who wants to experience the beauty of blockchain while risking nothing. It encourages study and rewards the best performers.

I lookup the /r/Piracy for some workaround and found out the excellent tool page.

I am not an active ICO investor and this may be my 3rd or 4th ICO participation, but the first to fail. Below are a couple of interesting facts and thoughts throughout this failed ICO experience: ICO is not a guaranteed success in the crypto space anymore. Timing for a token sale can be vital. New project is likely to fail in a bear market when the hot money is getting away and investors tend to hold fewer altcoins. Smart contract is being used in the token sale for token distributing and refund. No fraud and no dispute, everything is executed smoothly. First time I witness the power of smart contract. The telegram has 36k member and can’t even meet the 4000 ETH soft cap which is the direct cause for the ICO to fail. Most of the members are just there for airdrops, or even scamming. Members of Telegram channel repeatedly reported for being scammed. This is a dangerous space to join if you don’t know the rule here. 最近经历了第一次失败的 ICO 筹资，有些小小的心得： ICO 已经不再是万无一失的招财树。 在错的时间（熊市）办 ICO，很大机会失败。 此 ICO 使用 Smart contract 来分派代币和 ICO 失败后归还 ETH。一切都是非常顺利可靠，不用担心有人从中作梗，强大非常。 Telegram 群会员有三万六千人之多，却凑不齐区区 4000 ETH 的众筹目标。看来很多人都是为空降糖果和骗人而来。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Lessons that I learned from a failed ICO’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/lessons-that-i-learned-from-a-failed-ico/"},{"title":"Cardano indicator ","text":"The cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA/BTC) settled at 0.0000328 BTC at 07:30 PM UTC at the Binance exchange on Thursday, April 19.

I mainly use it on the PC only for free while mobile app requires subscribing to their paid service which I don’t feel like to. Lastpass serves me well and despite some minor issues. Lastpass to BitwardenAfter some researches, I decided to change from Lastpass to Bitwarden for some obvious reasons: Lastpass is a highly commercialised product and was acquired previously. I don’t like the idea making a profit on user data while the users have no share in the deal. Also, a commercialised product usually values profit more than security. Lastpass is closed source that no one knows what they are doing with user’s password behind. Although Bitwarden is the hosted service, they are open source and anyone can review their code anytime.

I can imagine how annoying and irritating this might sound to bankers. At the least 3% handling/admin/processing fee, this transaction alone will incur a fee of 30,000 USD. Bankers or money transfer service providers just lost the profit equivalent to a house down-payment. Even if they promise to offer a huge discount on the fee, how long will it need to be processed? More than 3 minutes if not for 3 days. I don’t even feel like mentioning that Steem could do that amount of transaction for free within 3 seconds. I can’t help but list the troubles one is going to face doing such a huge transaction with the banks. Some authorities will be triggered and you will have to prove the legitimacy of the money.

Checksum is the only way to make sure that the integrity of downloaded file. The idea is, as long as the checksum hash provided by the official site match with file’s hash, the integrity of the file can be assured that it is clean to use. Windows doesn’t come with a native Hash checking toolThough you might argue that Get-FileHash native command is available in PowerShell, it is not even close to user-friendly and requires a high familiarity with command interface which most Windows users are not capable of. We need something that can be done using merely the clicks. Another problem of hash checking tool is, users will have to compare the generated hash and compare to official hash manually (often by eyes), characters to characters. This is truly inefficient and stupid considering a compare function can do the job within second and eliminate all the human errors. Introducing the HashCheck The HashCheck Shell Extension makes it easy for anyone to calculate and verify checksums and hashes from Windows Explorer. It is fast and efficient, with a very light disk and memory footprint, and it is open-source. Yeah, another awesome open-source project. Check it out here. Now you can verify the checksum in a really neat way. I will demonstrate the process using a file downloaded from KeePass 2.38 portable version. The Integrity page will have all the hash for each file which I can use to check against later. Install the HashCheck. Download the Keepass test file, right click on it and select Properties. There will be one new Checksums tab where all the hashing is already done using famous algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1. I copy the MD5 hash (or you can choose any hash) and paste into the Find column to check against the generated MD5 hash from the file. The matched hash will be highlighted. Now I can be sure this file is not compromised and safe to use. HashCheck comes with other handy features as well which you can explore. Of course, you don’t have to hash checking every file from the Internet but it is highly recommended to do for any suspicious source. The best idea is only to download files from the trustable sites and perform checksum verification afterward and you will be able to prevent attacks from compromised files. Happy hash checking! 总和检验码（Checksum）是一个端到端的校验和，由发送端计算，然后由接收端验证。 其目的是为了发现TCP首部和数据在发送端到接收端之间发生的任何改动。 所以要是从可以的网站上下载东西，最好就是验证其总和检验码。而在 Windows 上执行这样的任务最佳的莫过于刚发现的 HashCheck。这软件轻巧，快速，还是开源的，快来试用吧。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Checksum tools in Windows’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/checksum-tools-in-windows/"},{"title":"I'm whitelisted in the Minnowbooster Community Whitelist","text":"@minnowbosoter recently introduced a new system called Community Whitelist which you can read more on the native post: https://steemit.com/minnowbooster/@minnowbooster/minnowbooster-epic-update-community-whitelist-now-online Some of the benefits of being whitelisted include:1.)

Before entering the circle of cryptocurrency, I never so been so paranoid about the security of some digital random phrase. The most important digital text to me was probably my online banking password, which I could easily retrieve by clicking on the “Forgot your password?” link. Crypto is a completely different gameThe rule is simple here – who owns the private key, who owns everything in it. There is no authority the victims could ask for help because they themselves are the only authority. While the hardware wallet like Trezor is the best device every crypto investor should get, there are still too many of interesting coins which haven’t partnered with hardware wallet. Steem is one of them so let’s take it as example. We all know how important is the Steem owner key, but how do you store them? How do you secure this ultra-sensitive long phrase that represents the absolute ownership of your Steem account? I used to store them using 7z built-in encryption method up to the moment before I’m writing this post. 7z does good in offering simple encrypting feature but it is designed for protecting truly sensitive data. KeepPass maybe the best and final solution here KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file. So you only have to remember one single master password or select the key file to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES and Twofish). KeePass has everything to be a perfect candidate of the crypto guardian: Open source so anyone can throw an security audit to it anytime. Offline so no one is hosting the database other than the user. Key file could be the best solution against key logging. Cross-platform Made to store various of password or complex code Use one of the most advanced encryption algorithms How to setup1)Download it here. Create a KeePass database file, in this case it is crypto_keys.kdbx. 2)Create a strong password is the key here. It should be strong enough to withstand any brute-forcing cracking process in case the database file is compromised. For the expert you might want to explore the key file method. 3)Simply give it a database name, keep the rest setting as default unless you want customize it further. 4)First let’s see how it store Steem’s key. I set fr3eze as the user name and put some random key as the password. 5)I will add another entry using EOS key pair. In this case I put ‘EOS’ as the title and leave the username empty. Private key in the password column while the public key in the note area. I leave other settings as default for both entry. 6)This is how the database looks like so far with the Steem and EOS entry. 7)Here is what making the KeePass really handy if you need to copy the user name, password or notes. Just double click on the text and you shall see the bottom bar indicating the click phrase is copied to the clipboard and will be cleared in 12 seconds. 8)Save and quit the KeePass. This is the database that I just created and it will be all you need to care about. Spread it over your private cloud or flash drive for better portability. There are many third party plugins from various platform to access this file but the general rule is stick only to those reputable or open source programs. This is by far the best method to store private information about crypto to me. Are you with me? KeePass 是开源项目里最有名气的密码管家，作为管理加密货币的绝密资讯最适合不过。比如恢复种子和私钥等等，之前都是用 7z 来简单的加密，使用 KeePass 的好处有： 免费开源，所以每个人都可以审核监督软件的安全程度。 离线设计，没有人拥有你的数据库，全是自己说了算。 加密设计非常先进。 跨平台。 本来就为收藏多种密码而设计。 不知你有什么更好保护货币密码的方法？ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Best way to store crypto credentials like private keys and seeds – Keepass’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/best-way-to-store-crypto-credentials-like-private-keys-and-seeds-keepass/"},{"title":"Overhead camera rig for art recording, improved!","text":"Set up an overhead camera rig last week, now the recording process is much more standardized and smoother than before.

I was very fascinated the team’s vision to maintain the cleanliness of the Steem platform by introducing the Smart star whitelisting system. Moderators from the Smartsteem team review applications from the public, approving or rejecting base on the quality of the author. Upon approval, whitelisted authors will be assigned from 1 star to maximum 3 star rating. The higher the rating the higher vote one can buy from the service. Minnowbooster however, follows the initiative of Smartsteem introducing the whitelist system. The difference is the process is more decentralised. There is no application but invitation. Whitelisted members get to vote on invited users, upon getting 3 votes one admin will be able to approve the whitelist user. There are more benefits to be a whitelisted member of than bigger votes capacity, read the original post for more insight. Which is the better service to buy votes?Assuming you are whitelisted in both service, Minnowbooster is going to be the superior choice now. Smartsteem was my favourite for their high and steady availability of votes capacity. However, due to last price spiking of Steem from $1.5, the demand for vote buying from Smartsteem surged as well. To maintain vote supply, the team has decided to reduce the vote-buying ROI to the range of 180% and 210%. Minnowbooster on the other hand, was always in the shortage of vote supply and that was the reason I decided to look for alternative and found Smartsteem. Somehow their vote supply is becoming steady lately and after a several vote-buying from the Minnowbooster, I found out the ROI could be around 220% and 240%. For the same 1 SDB, Smartsteem would give you a vote at maximum $2.2 vs $2.4 from the Minnowbooster. I’d definitely go for Minnnowbooster unless things changed.

I used to make artwork in contests with specific themes, many will focus on the end result of how amazing the drawing skills were used and how beautiful the final work looks. But few appreciating the effort in finding the subject to interpret the theme, to me that is the most important part to settle before lifting the pens. This artwork was made with my recent favorite art tool, the Copic markers. I have many black and grey color set in hand which coincidentally match with @cryptogee book’s theme – dark and something technopunk. 这是首次在 Steem 上作画而不是为了参加比赛。很开心的宣布这是首次我和 @crytpogee 的一次在创作上的合作。他在自己的主页上定时连载了科幻小说《Asimov’s Ghost》，有兴趣的可以去支持下。 合作的模式就是他根据每个章节的内容给我点指示，然后我在画出来交差，他就会连画和那个章节一起发布。 这幅作品依然是由我近来最爱的 Copic 马克笔所创造。Copic 名下的颜色系列实在是太过庞大（300+色）而且很贵，我的手上主要拥有调色为主的黑色灰色系列，凑巧的和 @cryptogee 要求的黑暗庞克风格不谋而合。 If you have followed my previous making-of post for artwork creation, I used to take pictures of the progress at quite a constant interval. Not this time as you can see, from sketch straight to the final product. Not because I changed the style of recording progress, but simply because I was so into it that I forgot to take a break and take pictures… Maybe this is an indicator telling me that I should do more of it? 值得一提的是，有留意过我以往的作品的朋友应该都会发现，我习惯性的会在固定的间隔记录当前进度，而这次只有第一张的草稿，接下来就直接跳成品了。 不是因为改变风格，而是一画起来就忘了，直到画完才发现。哈哈，也许说明了我很享受这次的创作过程？ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Bot art illustration 机械人 | 月旦评’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/bot-art-illustration-or/"},{"title":"Bitcoin is a gamble or investment?","text":"Read an interview about how the great Warrant Buffet sees the cryptocurrency. He is not buying the idea of investing in Bitcoin obviously, again, for a couple of reasons stated below: Bitcoin is not a Ponzi “If you buy something like a farm, an apartment house, or an interest in a business… You can do that on a private basis… And it’s a perfectly satisfactory investment. You look at the investment itself to deliver the return to you. Now, if you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don’t really have anything that has produced anything. You’re just hoping the next guy pays more.” While generally, I would kind of agree with him on the last sentence as that is how the supply and demand drive up the price. But comparing a house to Bitcoin is like the apple and orange comparison, they are just different. There is a dozen of ways to make a profit out of a house investment. Rent the unit out to the tenants, create tax-free profit from the mortgage, turn it into a homestay business, and etc. Or you can simply make money the Bitcoin way, buy low sell high. No matter how you buy a broken house, fix it up, invest in some renovation, and sell it out with a brand new price, or just flipping houses on the market. When it comes to trading, we all are practically hoping the next guy pays more for what we have paid.** The same applies to gold, stocks as well as Bitcoin. Trading is just a tiny part of Bitcoin “Now if you ban trading in farms, you can still buy farms and have a perfectly decent investment,” he said, but if trading in bitcoin was banned, people would have no reason to invest. Bitcoin is not boomed on its fame for merely the explosiveness in profit gaining by trading, though I believe that would be the big part of the reasons Bitcoin became one of the most search keywords in Google. It is more to offer than that. Bitcoin is first thing ever created to be the real smart programmable money that happened in 2009 (I heard of it a few times before taking a serious look at it by last year, shame!). It shows the world we can actually have a currency that is not controlled by the centralised entity, which is usually the government. It was the absolute a fresh breath in the human-dominant world where human is atop of everything. By introducing the decentralised ledger technology(blockchain) and a new way of consensus(proof of work), Bitcoin is the first money that obeys nothing but the code. Code is the only king here, it decides how the coin should behave and takes no order from any traditional authorities. Comparing to all the fiats available on the planet, Bitcoin is the only currency one can study everything about it by the open information available on the Internet. When was the first block of Bitcoin mined? What is biggest Bitcoin transaction? Which wallet hold the most Bitcoin? Everything is ready for you to dig it out. Now, answer me the question above but replacing the Bitcoin with US Dollar. Anyone can predict the price of Bitcoin tomorrow or 10 years later, the fact is no one actually knows and we should leave it to the open market. It might drop to zero against the dollar one day. But the Bitcoin itself is not going to anywhere, it remains on the Internet forever, with the finite supply of 21 million. In the ideal world, Bitcoin shall not be compared to fiat for its value, it doesn’t care. It is us, the traders, the speculator, and the people who care most about the price. Bitcoin is like the Internet. The Internet doesn’t care if you use it for charity payment or surfing porn. It is not appropriate to view Bitcoin as just a trading asset.

Since I already involved in the awesome Steem for about a year and most of my readers are most probably Steem users, I will use Steem as the main example in this writing. We are all unique and good at something individuallyThis is the first assumption I have to make and I do believe in it unless you are a 3-year-old who cannot operate a computer properly yet.

Since I have the video ready, it would cost me nothing to post it again on YouTube. People would love to watch art-process videos like that. The finished artwork will be the main material for a formal write-up on Steem describing the making-of process. Better yet, instead of creating something randomly I can source for interesting contests and take part accordingly. By doing so, I can profit from the original post-payout and stand a chance to earn the prize. Furthermore, my recent collaboration with @cryptogee will greatly enhance my audience stream for the artwork at the same time his stories could be complemented with some precise illustrations. While you can’t just force such opportunity to happen but the possibility is unlimited with Steem amazing communities. In short, out of a single drawing I will end up with at least two content in different form, and multiply its profitability by participating in contest and collaboration. Singing, dancing, performing artist. You can turn anything into a content with the help of Steem platform. Take singing for an instance, you may record the singing process in the studio with a video. Extract the audio and upload it as a song to DSound, and upload the music video of you singing to DTube. Live streaming the singing via DLive could use a great way to build up fanbase quickly as well. Finally, you may do a write-up regarding the song, contribute it to some singing challenges. Other talents or interestsApplies the same formula to everything you love doing, without limitation. Love to cook? Take photos of the process and make an article about the recipe, record the cooking process down and make it a video. If you are giving instructions or guides through the process, extract it out in audio format and you have the material of your new God of Chef podcast series. Lego lover? No problem. Do a time-lapse video on how you build one model from scratch, write about the process and end product. Additional audio content if you are talkative. Or you may even do a live streaming via DLive. The possibility is endless if you know which service to use. SummarySo you got the idea now, it is about how to harvest multiple contents in a single activity. Think about how you can turn the readable content(Steemit) to a watchable video(DTube or DLive), listenable format(DSound), applicable software(Utopian) and many more. One tip: To maximize the profit out of the hobby, you must be really good at that in order to stand out. Folks have no interest in watching fitness video that teaches how to accomplish 5 pushups.

I was deeply amazed how it could change one’s life completely, especially from the finance aspect. I never stop to looking for ways to increase my holding in BTC, thicken my overall net worth every day. There are already tons of way to earn coins or tokens and if I have to count things that I’ve done throughout the journey, it would be: Day trading with altcoins pair Join airdrops event Creating contents in Steem Hold coins for a medium or long-term and sell for profit I think it is time to try something new. Running a node will be a totally different path in generating income and I regard that as one of the more immersive ways to get involve in a particular project. Also, my system admin profession could be helpful in setting up nodes and this already sounds exciting to me as I’m already maintaining and setting up servers in the normal day job but to have my own machine that literally printing money? Sounds like a dream. Why SmartCash?Learning from the MasterNodes.online and several SmartCash communities, SmartCash has the following advantages: SmartCash has over 11k nodes running shows that it has a strong communities support. GitHub activity is not ultra active but not too bad either. Here is the listfor their GitHub repo. SmartRewards allows the holder to get 15% of the block rewards every 30 days without any withdrawal. Killer features, much like the Power-up system in Steem to encourage faith. SmartNode(their naming for node) will get 10% of Block Reward, on top of the SmartRewards. SmartNode only requires 10,000 SMART for operation. Pricing at $0.114 now, a node will just cost $1,140 excluding other minor costs. SMART just took a dive today and I see it as a good point of entry(I’ve passed the age to buy coins only in green.) The team has just announced their new privacy-oriented coin - BitcoinConfidential which will be airdropped to SmartCash owner at 10:1 ratio. Though I’m not impressed by the lame name, still a added bonus for entering now. To my surprise the team has an official account on Steem - @smartcash. I love Steem, and that makes me love those who embrace Steem. VerdictI will make this a series to record my SmartNode journey.

The former is having higher trading volume overall so I registered a new account and bought the SMART there. One good thing about HitBTC is the user-friendliness that users do not need to do BS actions like KYC or taking a stupid photo. It is just plugs and plays. As a SmartNode requires 10,000 SMART, I bought 10,100 SMART with the extra 100 just in case it will be needed for any transaction fee. The price was around 0.0000119 BTC with a total cost of 0.1202 BTC which is equivalent to 1,137.64 USD as of now. Should be quite a good deal considering it has just dropped 12% today. This coin has been readily declining over a month, not sure what is actually happening behind the scene but I see no big deal-breaker bad news upon my research.

That was the first formal appearance in such a mainstream finance news provider, at least as far as I know and being informed as such by the elder steemians. This is my first time watching the big boss talk to the mass audience who are most probably do not have the command of blockchain understanding. Kind of weird seeing him trying to explain things in a really layman term as I usually read discussion of techie big-shot like him in a very deep level. He handled the conversation well enough anyhow. The funny thing is, when I watch he speaks in the video I feel some connection with this very guy as I tried to put myself as his target audience. Oh, this is the guy (and the mighty Dan, of course) who created a platform where I spent lots of my time diving in it for a year like never before. Subconsciously I take him as a very down-to-earth, real and close guy explaining something to me. Is it because we both share a deep trust on Steem itself? Is it because I have been benefited financiaand spiritually ever since? Is it because he was trying to explain some concepts to me while those were already part of my beliefs?

I have passed the age using the amount of likes to satisfy my vanity. I’m tired of my news feed full with unwanted ads and I’m in need of seeking something new.

Since I’m running a Win 10 OS, this guide will use Windows environment as background. Download a desktop wallet from: https://smartcash.cc/wallets/ At the final stage of installation, user will be asked where is the location the blockchain storage should be located at. Put this directory on SSD if you have one! This will greatly improve the initialization and I will explain it later. The installation is pretty straight forward. After opening the wallet up for the first time, you will see the Blockchain syncing bar at the bottom left saying 40 weeks behind. The wallet is trying to download the whole blockchain for it to operate normally. And this is going to take forever to complete. Here is how you can speed up the whole syncing process. Completely close the wallet. Proceed to the wallet download page again and download the bootstrap. Click on it and the bootstrap will start to download with name txindexstrap.zip and 453 MB in size. Do this step as soon as you can because the download speed is quite slow running around 120 KB/s. Go to the installed directory of SmartCash blockchain, delete the folders blocks and chainstate. Unzip the bootstrap txindexstrap.zip you have just downloaded, copy the blocks and chainstate inside to the installed directory of SmartCash blockchain where you just deleted the folders. These bootstrap consisting a big portion of the current blockchain and so that you can use it to skip the long and never-ending syncing process executed by the wallet. This is something needed to be improved by the dev team. Next step is creating a text file named smartcash.conf and add txindex=1 to it. Save and close the file. Now you may open the wallet again. Look at the loading page at the bottom, the loading bar is processing the bootstrap file that you just threw inside at the blockchain storage. And the speed was completely decided by the disk type of where the storage is residing. I’ve made a huge mistake by storing the blockchain storage on my HDD to avoid wasting my precious SDD space. As you can see on the left pic, the Disk usage is at full 100% while the write speed is throttled around 300 KB/s. To give a clearer picture, this loading process took me slightly more than 24 hours to complete on a pretty decent rig. To not further suffer in the future syncing process, I redo everything but placing the storage on a SDD. The write speed was as high as 9 MB/s and averaging at 4 MB/s as shown in the right picture, took me less than 3 hours to complete the job. Lesson well learnt. Summary Local wallet is necessary to be fully synched before setting up SmartNode. Wallet synching can take a very long time. Placing blockchain storage at SSD can hugely increase synching speed.

Due to various reasons, the ICO failed and could not proceed further. Refund was started in immediately in using different mechanisms. Public sale refund by smart contractTo the public sale(ICO) participant, refund will be executed by smart contract by Ethereum platform where this new coin is build upon. The smart contract says that if the softcap could not be hit by the end of ICO, fund collected to this certain address will be open for refund claiming. Or it hits the softcap development team will gains access to the fund to carry on the project. So investors in the ICO period can have a peace of mind knowing they have the protection by the code. Unfortunately (or fortunately), I got the chance to experience how the refund works in smart contract. Overall, the refund is not fully automated but still requires some simple operations on the user side. Following the guidance using MEW, I’ve got my ETH back very quickly without issues. However, things are not as smooth for another category of investors. Pre-sale refund by humanPre-sale is where investor will get maximum benefit for funding a new project right before ICO kicks in and brings in mass investors. Smart contract is not used in the pre-sale stage and I have no idea why. It seems that all fund is collected via normal transaction. After crowdfunding failed, the dev team announced that pre-sale investor will get the refund after their accountant minus minor admin fee from the collected fund. Sounds logical to me and not a difficult operation to carry out. None of my business nonetheless. I got my refund from smart contract after the ICO ended and I moved on. One month later I randomly click in the official Telegram channel and check. What? The refund for presale is not yet done?? It’s been like over a month for a simple refund like this to process, are you kidding me? People are ranting to the admins that they want their fund back, some of them even start to consider taking legal action upon the team. The admins on the other hand, keep responding in a professional manner and keep the folks cool. But there is only one theme the admin’s response, keep cool can wait for official announcement. I would be mad if I was one of the poor pre-sale investors.Now admins you can’t blame people for losing patience or even start to relate this to a scam. I’m not sure how difficult to get the refunding job done definitely it is not something cannot be settled within a month. This is ridiculous. I’m so glad I didn’t take part in the presale. VerdictThis is the first time I witnessed and made real use of smart contract. It does help a lot in shifting the trust away from third party(ICO team in this case). I hope the team will figure things out soon as I think this is likely not a scam despite damage has been done. 前一阵子经历了第一次 ICO 失败，在退款上看到了 Smart contract 的威力。那个团队设计 ICO 的筹款是由智能合约来进行，在某个时间之前必须达到一定额度的 Softcap，不然就会启动退款合约，后来也很不幸的 ICO 失败了。经过简单的手续后我也很顺利的收到了退款，反看在 Pre-sale 的投资者就没这么好运了。 Pre-sale 不知为何没有使用智能合约，用的是普通的交易方式。所以 ICO 失败后，团队要扣除点管理费再把余款退换。这样一拖就拖到了一个月后的现在，电报群里的投资者早已怨声载道，有者还打算采取法律行动。而 admin 翻来覆去也得个拖字诀。说真的，是我的话也会很暴躁。希望尽快有个好结果吧。 真好运被强大的智能合约救了。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Smart contract saved me some ETH from a potential ICO scam’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/smart-contract-saved-me-some-eth-from-a-potential-ico-scam/"},{"title":"SmartCash#4 - VPS service that accepting STEEM","text":"Set up a VPSIn order to get the node reward by running a SmartNode, you will have to make sure the machine that hosting the node is having high availability.

Being said that, you will not want to run the node in something unstable(like your own PC) even you can actually. This is where a VPS(Virtual Private Server) comes in handy. There are many VPS service providers out there these days with a really competitive price. I’ve gone through a several research to find out that Vultr and Digital Ocean are one of the most recommended services in the community starting for only $5 per month. I almost go to sign up my first VPS with Vultr, right before I found this service. VPS that founded from SteemI stumbled upon this service while surfing Steemit, it turns out this might be the best opportunity I could find as a Steemian. They have a Steem account @privex and @someguy123 is the main guy behind it. Privex is running a simple website with the sole purpose of accepting VPS order: https://www.privex.io/ Having a researching habit before purchasing anything, Privex is giving me a hard time finding reviews on site like Reddit or general technical forum. Simply because of one reason, this proud VPS is not accepting fiat! So I guess there is no point for the team to run marketing as the focus is on the niche crypto community. Thus I focus my review hunting in the Steem community and learnt that many of the Steem witnesses are using Privex VPS. The team behind of Privex seems to know their stuff which only makes me more comfortable in getting a VPS from them. But these are not the main reasons after all… Privex is accepting STEEM/SBD! Litecoin and BTC is the other crypto being accepted as well, but who cares when we already earning the feeless STEEM? Their most basic package with 1GB RAM is priced at $8, definitely not the best price I can find from the other offers. I would say being able to pay with a crypto that I’m constantly earning every day is already sounds like a dream to me. This is the single irresistible selling point I simply could not reject. Not sure how long I would stay with them as the server quality, support availability and many other factors(the steep pricing), I’ve decided to give it a try anyhow. I proceeded with the SBD option and the system calculated the current market price of SBD, hence my first payment is $2.847. Paying crypto to set something that will earn me more crypto? Never heard of a better idea. VerdictFinally got received my server information to proceed with my SmartNode setup and here is what I can say about this service so far: Cons: Expensive. No confirmation of payment via website or email. Could take up to 3 days in getting the VPS ready upon payment. Got mine after 2 days. No root access at the handover, I’m trying to request for it. No 24-hour support service so user might have to cope with Belize timezone. Pros: Accepting crypto like STEEM/SBD. No unnecessary cost is wasted in the transaction process. Helps to grow the real application of STEEM. Good reputation in Steem communities.

Bought 3k Steem to make myself a minnow the first day, I know how hard it is to gain a bigger impact on this platform given who owns the larger SP often gets more of the attention. So the priority for my SP is always same as other classes of investment, ‘How can I not lose the money and make as much profit out of it as possible?” Luke perfectly demonstrated how to make money using current system like voting bots, delegation or SP renting. Honestly, that is what I spent a big portion of my time studying. Which service to buy vote for best profitability? How to take advantage of Steem delayed feed_price and things like that. I have to admit these are made with a narrow perspective and I doubt that would help to improve our ecosystem in a big way. Long-Term Rational Self-InterestI’m always curious what motivate whales to delegate that much of SP to non-profit projects which often sums up more than what I have in my total effective SP. If that amount of SP was being rented away to voting bots like @minnowbooster or @smartsteem, the delegator would easily earn a truly passive income of a few thousand dollars every month. As more as I familiarized with how the system is running, I know how we as the community can do to improve the overall quality and bring up the value of this place. Spam fighting, curating the deserving posts, encouraging newcomers to stay, supporting quality projects. In short, everything about eliminating the bad and promoting the good. I acknowledge and salute the whale’s effort in order to do things that would eventually benefit the community in the long run while constantly sacrificing theirs. Minnows can contribute in another way However, minnows following what the whales do will only bring negligible if not zero impact to the system. The analogy of whale and minnow exists for a reason here, the same roll over in the sea will be forming a huge wave for the former while merely a droplet for the later. Imagine a minnow delegating away all of his 100 SP to a project, technically it would help the project to be 100 SP stronger but it would play a bigger role if such amount of minor SP could be used in smaller scale such as: Curate worthy content of new users so a dolphin or whale might discover it. Not necessarily to downvote spam content because that would hurt the precious VP, at least not upvoting them. In making a profit via bots, try to do it with sane service like @buildawhale which says no to bad content creators. Self-voting is Okay, but try not to do it like there is no tomorrow. That SP will bring in better return investing in the socialization with others. Make quality content.

This is very much a high risk experimental act and I’m prepared to lose all the fund invested. Do your own research as this is not a financial advice. Setting up the real dealOkay, after a series of operation we now have all the critical element to finally get the SmartNode started. 10,000 SMART, fully-synchronized local wallet, and a reliable VPS are all we need to set up the money printing machine. I will not post the step by step guide as there are sites and documentation online which already did the explanation so well that I never could. This post will be more of the tips in setting up SmartNode after much preparations: Useful resourcesAll in all, http://smartnodes.cc/ basically consists of everything one needs to know about how to set up SmartNode. It covers documentation from Mac, Linux to Windows, including much Bash scripts that would further enhance the stability of the server but I have yet to try them. I set up local wallet in Windows OS and Linux Ubuntu on the VPS(of course) so I will recommend base on these background. Other than the official SmartNode site, items below were being used as the main reference as well: How To Set Up A SmartNode | Windows 10:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEFw6Y1BAMc SmartCash SmartNode SCRIPT Setup Guide v2.2 for Windows 10: http://smartnodes.cc/files/SmartCash_SmartNode_Script_Setup_Guide_v2.2.pdf Use rootDuring the process of setting SmartNode on the VPS, remember you must execute everything using root. Even if some of the operations might not need root permission to perform, doing it with other users might cause troubles later which can be really hard to troubleshoot. As I assume most of the VPS providing root user as default, @privex offer the VPS with second class user ubuntu. However if your were offered with users other than root, use command sudo su or sudo su root and you will be granted root access. Use bootstrap to speed up syncingYes, the same sycning thing you took year to complete on setting up the wallet will have to do it all again on the Linux VPS. The way to speed the process up is all the same with local wallet, just that now you will have to do it with command line. Follow the detailed guide in SmartNode FAQ and you will be good. Take note that the steps suggesting do the step before smartcashd is started running but my experience proved this caution doesn’t matter. Just execute the command and you will see the blockchian syncing become a loading progress using command smartcash-cli getinfo. Took me about 3 hours to complete. Yay, finally got you running babe! Use the SmartNodeMonitorAs we know if the node was down for 1 hour the uptimr will be set to zero meaning that node will have to queue all over again to enter the payment zone. So right after I get my node running, the first thing I want is a tool to help monitoring node status. I was ready to make a bash script on the VPS, until I found this piece of gem. SmartNodeMonitorBot on Telegram is the monitoring bot all one needs to maintain a node. You can add all multiple nodes in the same bot and it will constantly pinging the node to check if it is still up and running. Grant me peace of mind after using this bot, truly a must get! Get it here:https://t.me/SmartNodeMonitorBot VerdictAlong the way of SmartNode installation going, I would say that the SmartCash ecosystem is more matured than I expected.

Well, my gratitude was just elevated to the next level for what I’m going to the report in this post. For a quick recap, I was taking part in an ICO public sale and it failed. Got my invested fund back almost instantly as the smart contract promised as such, all fund will be refunded if the public sale softcap was failed to hit. However things are not as smooth for the presale investor whereby fund was collected in a not-smart-contract way I supposed. And the ICO admin claimed that they will refund the presale fund after deducting administration and marketing fee. There were no progress for over a month since ICO failed, while I have got my refund back and has nothing to do with the rest of the matter, I still interested to follow up how things are going. Eventually got an update for the long-awaited presale refund. Each Presale investors are getting 25.68% of their investment Yes, you read that right. A bloody 25.68% refund for all the presale investors, 75% loss without doing anything. If you have invested 10 ETH in the presale, you are getting back 2.56 ETH as a refund. The Telegram channel was booming with raging messages from investors after the official announcement, so happening that the momentum was comparable favourably with the period when airdrop was announced back in the days. Honestly I was deep in shock as well to learn this outcome. I thought the marketing fee would maybe eat up a few percentage of the investment and people should expect to get back at least 90%, I was naive. And I can’t help but immediately linked the “crime” word with everything going on behind the scene. I wasn’t expecting anything like this coming at all, call me innocent and I will accept that. However I’m not alone in the channel, people are mad. Some member made a good point saying that investor should not bear any responsibility for marketing fee, let alone making them pay that steep price for a failed ICO. I would call that a sane and logic statement. I assumed that should be the default mode of every ICO on the market. On the other hand, admin from the team defended by claiming there is a particular clause in the Presale agreement which all the investors have been signed and agreed to. Personally I wasn’t aware of this clause and was too lazy to dig it out and verify the claim. But if it is true, the ICO team is probably not guilty. The annoyed investors then asked for a complete breakdown of accounting report, admin promised to provide that although that is not compulsory according to the legal term. But I guess this pretty much should be the end of story. VerdictThis incident totally changed my perspective towards ICO. Though the team would make everything looks legit on the surface, there are just too many loopholes can be exploited behind the scene. According to the members, 2000 ETH was collected for presale, 75% of it would be 1500 ETH which equivalent to 1m USD. For marketing display by the team over the period, I would say 1m USD is more than an overkill. Read every clause on the bloody contract before signing when money is at stake. Losing 75% of fund for nothing is no fun. Code is definitely more reliable than human. ICO is a dangerous game. 自从上次的第一次 ICO 失败后，现在来跟进一下后续。前文提要为 ICO 失败后，presale 的投资者由于没有收到智能合约的保护，还在等待官方公布清算后的退款数额。 结果几天前出来了，那就是所有 presale 投资者可以拿回 25.68% 的资金。也就是说投资 10 ETH，拿回 2.56 ETH，剩下的被宣传费用报销了。也就是说投资者什么都不做，75% 的钱就蒸发了，你说神奇吗？ 尽管官方人员说 presale 协议上已经说明了这个条例（我也懒得去查证反正事不关己），但是可想而知的整个群组还是吃了原子弹一样，吵得炸开了。 经过这次的 ICO，我学到了： 和钱有关的所有条例，读清楚才好签下。 代码果然是比人类靠谱多了。 ICO 真的很危险。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘ICO is a dangerous game | 危险游戏’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/ico-is-a-dangerous-game/"},{"title":"Illustration #4 - Clone","text":"It’s been long since my last artwork created on the black sketchbook.

I’m honoured to be invited to the lunch by @jrvacation. It was a rainy afternoon, the restaurant wasn’t crowded, the food was great, and the people are nice. I had a great time. Maybe one of the biggest surprises to me is having to meet up a real crypto guy and a very reputable figure in the Steem space himself, @knozaki2015. Impressive crypto knowledge and experienceComing from the place where crypto or blockchain is still very much regarded as a tool of ponzi schemes, I always feel like a lone ranger after discovering how big the blockchain tech can be for this planet. Most of the guys I’ve talked to are not convinced even just to open an account in Steemit with zero cost and minor effort at all. I think Mr Knozaki was my first one to exchanged so much coin names in real life conversation with. The only difference is, I was just heard of those coins because they made it to the top 100 in Coinmarketcap, but he discovered it all when they were under the radar. Something you ignored today might be the next big thing tomorrow.There are unlimited supply of Bitcoin success stories since the boom of BTC last year, reading them will always lead me to the envious thinking like “If only I could buy that $4 BTC back in the old days…”. I think people used to think their younger self was more ignorant and often duller compared to the wiser position they are at today, such concept would be more obvious when recalling something you’ve done wrong or big opportunities that you’ve missed in the past. Well, I was a mindless boy wasting my time at the University time back in 2010 and I was dirt poor there is nothing I can do if I found out Bitcoin that time. Yeah, maybe I can tell that to myself to make the regret of missing out lighter. I would say that I’m a lot wiser these recent years, and I missed the Steem in 2016, too. The moral of the story here is, the opportunities are always there for us all. Looking back to the recent get-rich-quick history events, the Internet era like Apple and Google when they were just penny stocks, cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum when they cost less than a pack of cigarette, I must not forget to mention how dirt-cheap was Steem. I missed them all. I really have to start to believe there are always some next BTC-like possibilities lurking around. Keep the eyes open, and always stay informed will be the best guideline ahead I guess. It takes more than just luck to succeed in cryptoThanks to the man Knozaki showed us how amazing the crypto world, he got our jaws dropped though he was sharing like it was nothing. He was so humble to give all credit to the luck for his success in crypto but Nah, I know it takes way more than pure luck to get to that position. They said get yourself a mentor no matter what field you’re developing in, and Knozaki is simply the perfect guy in crypto. Such a shame we didn’t have enough time to have a deeper conversation. Well, who said we can’t have more meet-ups in the future right(hopefully haha)? Lastly, glad to know also the lovely @yoshiko from the Japanese community.

Smartbot on the Steem The @smartbot is running on Steem blockchain and serving as the name suggested, a Tip Bot. Not sure how exactly is this bot running in the background as it is kind of closed source, I will try to make a few assumptions on how the @smartbot is going to work base on my observation and understanding(which can be quite accurate to the fact). Everyone on Steem will automatically be assigned with a SmartCash address which can be verified by using the @smartbot address command in any comment area. The logic behind should be the same as sending crypto to email address because each email addresses are unique, as well as out Steem account name. While I know SmartCash actually support the feature by sending SMART by email and any fund not collected within 7 days will be auto-returned, there are not stated if the tip sent by @smartbot will practice the same rule as well. But why leave the SMART at the Steem account while you can claim it to own wallet and start collecting SmartReward or even start a SmartNode? Screenshots above showed how I transfer 60 SMART to my own wallet. The response of @smartbot is really quick and responsive. Within 10 seconds you shall see the fund appears in your wallet. Oh, did I forget to mention how I get those tips?SmartCash made a really genius move by hosting an official account(@smartcash） on Steem which is not seen in many other crypto projects when Medium and Reddit are still the mainstream promoting sites. Steemit.com is already a top-1000 website globally and I would say partner with this new strong force for building SmartCash community is a brilliant idea. To make things even more awesome, Team SmartCash is running persistent weekly event by tipping great content about SmartCash. Making a contribution to the SmartCash content and everyone is entitled to win the tip from 30 to as high as 450 SMART(around $45)! I’ve got a few tips for 30 SMART each since the beginning of this series, I would not say that is a big amount but definitely nice to have. Especially I wasn’t started with competitive mindset at all. As stated before this series is meant to be a documentation of my journey in SmartCash while providing some insights to the community and outsiders.

Though I’m not sure if this site list all the coins possible already, the listed coins are more than enough for my research as I didn’t hear of most of them. The famous one among them is the Monero(XMR), Bytecoin(BCN) and others. Find the site here: http://minecryptonight.net/ Besides the coins list, they have some nice tabs giving valuable information like How to mine CryptoNight coins explaining coin mining in a brief summary. Definitely a good read even if you are not up to mining. What coins to mine?I do not choose coins depends on the profitability base on the site’s sorting as well. First, I could not verify how valid is the sorting and even if they track it accurately. Secondly, the market is just too volatile for choosing side base on current pricing. You can go for the top profitable coins mining now and by the time you mined a considerable amount of it, it might drop to the bottom of list. Since I have almost zero cost on the electricity and a really casual mining power with my ordinary PC, solely chasing after the profitability for a coin short-term is not a wise move. The much better idea is, study all the CryptoNight coins listed and hoping them to gain value over time. That would include study the code committing rate over Github, check out community activities, project’s roadmaps and unique idea. I will study each and maybe come up with a short report here on Steem about my finding. 见证加密货币的精彩世界一年有余了，可以说已经尽可能地去参与很多不同的项目和技术了，但是有一块也是最大一块我从来都不想去鹏的领域，那就是挖矿。 一直觉得挖矿时很吃力不讨好的脏活，不怀疑其赚钱的潜力，但是同时要解决的硬件和电力问题时非常头痛的。直到最近有了一个免费挖矿的机会，我决定踏入这个挖矿的世界，顺便好好了解到底挖矿是怎么运作的。有的算力并不多，少过 1kH/s 吧。主要是想利用多余的算力来看看 CPU 挖矿是怎么一回事，再者 CPU 挖矿花费的电力也不会想 GPU 那么高。在这里就不可不说 CryptoNight 这个演算法，它最初出现的目的就是利用 CPU 来挖矿，Monero 就是大名鼎鼎的 CryptoNight 币之一。 Minecryptonight.net是个专门列出 CryptoNight 项目的一个网页，从高到低排列了很多可以用 CPU 挖矿的项目。老实说，除了 Bytecoin 和 Monero 有很多我听都没听过。 那么如何选择要挖什么币呢？ 尽管上面的这个网站有列出各个项目的获利性，我并不打算将之作为依据，原因有二。其一，没人知道这里获利性排名是否正确。其二，就算信息正确无误，在这个龙卷风式的币圈，可能今天你选择挖最赚钱的币，等挖到一定数量时它说不定早就跌出榜外了。 因为我不是急着挖了就卖，最正确的策略应该是研究榜上的所有币种，选择最有前瞻性和活跃性的那个来下手，以期在未来的某个时刻会爆发。或许以后可以在这里简短的报告研究结果。 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Mining the CryptoNight coins with casual PC | 挖矿’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/mining-the-cryptonight-coins-with-casual-pc/"},{"title":"First NBA live session outdoor in Singapore! | 不怎么精彩的抢七","text":"The game 7 of NBA western conference final falling on the Wesak Day which is the public holiday here in SG is probably one of the luckiest things that happen to this week.

You have to understand that NBA in Asia countries like Malaysia and Singapore is still far less than a big event like the football. Credit to the genius @jessie901220 to find such a great place. Nothing is funnier to watch a NBA game with the company of people who share the same interest. I would say I had a great time there. They are numerous of big TVs(60 or 70 inch, I’m not sure) installed at different angles streaming the same game with great resolution. The audience definitely can find a suitable spot for a comforatble viewing experience. But the only drawback is, their breakfast set with bacon burger sucks. Do not order that. And this is why I’m not streaming the game today. Sorry if some of you are waiting for one. Image The storefront of Boomarang, the very shop we were having a great time. Address: BOOMARANG BOAT QUAY, 52 Circular RoadSingapore 049407 Back to the game itself, nothing surprise and well within my expectation. You won’t be thinking the Rockets with one superstar less can even beat the full healthy team of Warriors. Same storyline as the last Game 6, Rockets led the pace in both offence and defence for the first two quarters. After the half-time break, Warriors slowly getting their hand hot and splash brothers start hitting crzy three pointers. Rockets trailing and the point defference getting bigger til the end of game. The 3rd quarter Warriors is the most explosive Warriors for real. Few things to note on the Rockets side, James Harden is just as childish as always and I can tell that by a several small incidents. He rejects the helping hand from Green who was trying to pull him up from the floor. He too get the locker room the first moment after the loss without congratulating the winners. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5SaKz1WmO8 A joke for the good evening. Enjoy. Call it competitive nature or just narrow-minded, this is a complete sign of lacking sportsmanship at all to me. Rockets will not go far with a leader as such. Would you mind to take a look at the other James at the East side please, Mr. Harden?

To make the scenarios more specific, the first will be making $10 per day consistently for a yearly sum around $3600. The second one will be more drastic, constantly making $0 a day but the catch is there are less than 10% that you will hit a $10,000 jackpot over a year. Which income will you take? Well, I’ve been mining for about a week and been thinking what strategy is the best for my condition. I have a steady job which supports most of my daily needs financially, I started to see the potential of mining in becoming the next steady source of income. However, this new stream of income can largely depend on different strategies. Given the same hashing power and cost basis, there are two main ways of mining: The Mine-and-SellThis is the mainstream way of mining as I observed. The approach is usually picking a famous coin preferably coins in the top 100 list to mine. After a certain amount of time, say monthly, sell away those coins for BTC or fiat for profit. The mining profit can be used to pay electricity bill or maintaining the miner machine. Pocket the remaining cash or use it to expand the mining rigs. Less risk, low but predictable income thanks to the stability of the famous coin. The Mine-and-HoldThis method is more in seeking explosive growth of mined coins. Pick under-the-radar coins which is ranging from the 500~2000 ranking and mine, if not the entirely new coins. If you talk about these coins with your crypto mate, chances are they never heard of it at all. Mine and keep the coins. You would not want to sell it now as they are mostly underpriced and with low trading volume. There are no profit gained in the process and miner has to bear with the incurred expenses like electricity bill. Make a choiceI have a day job which provided me with a stable pay and I don’t mine for a living at all, that’s the biggest reason I have no appetite for the Mine-and-Sell. To be honest, I will always go for the more aggresive and gambling-like Mine-and-Hold way. Go big or go home! The rough plan is, use my limited hashing power to mine the coins with low difficulty but with some prospect. Some researchs has to be done and come out with a list of coins to be mined. With my current 2k H/s, I will be able to mine any young projects to 10,000 coins within a week. Upon hitting the 10k mark, jump to mine the next coin in the list and so on. So say at the end of the days, I will hold 100 different bags of coins with 10k each. I shall do nothing until one of them to appear in the top 100 list in coinmarketcap.com. Worst come to worst, that 100 bags of coins all failed and fell to zero. The most I can lose is the electricity fee incurred in the process and it won’t be much since I’m mining the CryptoNight coins with power-saving CPU. Sounds like a plan, isn’t it? What do you think and which strategy would you choose if you were me? 慢而稳，还是博彩式 挖矿有毒，这一个礼拜的挖矿实验真的让人越踩越深。已经有打算好好利用手中的资源认真挖一挖，那么问题来了，到底怎么挖法才是最适合自己？经过几天的考虑，发现有两种挖矿风格： 挖了就卖 - 相信这也是市面上矿工们的主流做法。选些稳定且有名的币来挖，这类币通常都是 Top 100 的名单上可以见到。好处是定期把币卖了可以抵消成本比如电费和维护费等等，剩余的还可以做为扩展用途。坏处就是由于币的价格趋于稳定，要赚大钱有难度。 挖了收着 - 顾名思义，就是只挖不卖。只选新币或是冷门小众的项目下手，趁挖矿难度还很低的时候挖了一笔就走，然后继续挖新的项目。坏处就是挖矿期间绝大可能不会有收益，还需要矿工自掏腰包付电费等。但是好处就是，要是手上的一袋袋新币要是某天爆发了，那个收益也一定是爆发性的。 由于我有稳定的工作来支撑生活支出，所以作为第二收入，第一个方法并不是很适合我。相反，挖了收着的巨大收益潜力最是吸引我不过，尤其里面蕴藏的赌局意味，更是挑战眼光和毅力。当然了，我是不会说自己是个赌徒的。 最差的情况就是手上收着的币到最后统统崩盘了，我损失的也不过是每个月几百的电费，不就是当作用那几百买币失败就好啦。 你怎么说？ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Consistent but slow VS go big or go home style of mining?’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/consistent-but-slow-vs-go-big-or-go-home-style-of-mining/"},{"title":"NBA Live Game 1 NBA Finals 2018: Golden State Warriors vs Cleveland Cavaliers","text":"Image Here we come the NBA Finals, Warriors VS Cavaliers for the fourth time.

Users can trade Tangem without worrying the banknotes being compromised. I got one Tangem for the 0.01 BTC face value but it comes without Bitcoin loaded inside already. User have to transfer Bitcoin to the banknote via apps from Google Playstore or Apple Store. The card is about the same length but narrower and slimmer compared to normal credit card size as you can see in the third screenshots. Definitely an ideal physical dimension for a banknote. Tangem mobile apps is essential in verifying, loading and withdrawing the digital assets inside. The apps itself is not under early Beta stage but I have tested to scan my Tangem via NFC and it read the content without problem. I could literally load 0.01 BTC into it and maybe trade with someone else who would receive it. Tangem offers a completely new ways to transact Bitcoin without some of the biggest drawbacks. All you need to do in a Bitcoin payment is just hand over the card, the process is validated immediately with zero fee while leaving no trace at all. Bitcoin might be the biggest innovation of this century in digitalizing currency, but if we take a step back and try to use it in traditional way as if it was physical cash, interesting results can be expected and Tangem is absolutely one of them. DisadvantageWhen you make the digital asset physical again, you expect it possesses the disadvantages of physical cash as well. Whoever get access to the Tangem could withdraw the Bitcoin inside via the apps. And if you lose the banknote, the Bitcoin within is gone as well as you don’t control the private keys.

This is very much a high-risk experimental act and I’m prepared to lose all the fund invested. Do your own research as this is not a financial advice. This feels like an eternityAfter setting up the SmartNode 24 days ago, finally I got to see this sweet notification in the morning. It has been so long that I have almost forgotten how everything was started. I wasn’t aware of the initial waiting time before setting up the node. And IMO this is definitely the most stupid mechanism just to make sure new nodes to have a certain amount of uptime before becoming eligible for the reward. Luckily the incoming project update will reduce this period down to 4 days. I’m particularly sure about the exact new period but this will be a great news to many. I’ve talked about the @smartbot on previous post and if @smartbot was meant to tip everyone who contributes to SmartCash on Steem platform, the next bot I’m going to talk about is a must to have for all the node owners. I can’t run the node without SmartNodeMonitor The biggest reason I’m using it is the ability to do what the bot name suggests it would do, monitor your running nodes. If you are not aware, all it take is 1 hour of downtime to completely wipe out your waiting time and start all over again for the next reward payment. If it happens in the initial waiting period which is easily almost a month long, it would spell disaster. SmartNodeMonitor helps by ping-ing the registered node every few minute and make sure it is still online. If the ping result is negative for more than 30 minutes, it will warns you to take further action to make things right. Following I will use a few screenshots to explain what this bot can do and my journey of waiting for the first reward. /detail is my most used command through the waiting period. It will show everything about the node and the most one will be taking note was the Position Initial wait time. This command was taken after my node was running after 2 days and you can see the remaining waiting time is about 17 days but this is not true. Due to the queue jumping mechanism, other nodes will jump in front of you from time to time and the countdown timer will sometimes moving backward. I will demonstrate further in the later screenshots. Fast forward to 3 weeks later, you can tell how long it has lapsed by looking at the Active since..., it was 23 days already instead of the originally suggested 19 days. This extension is understandable as more nodes are joining the network and the difficulty will only goes up. And finally I can see the countdown timer in Hour unit instead of the never-ending Day. When your node finally made to the top 10% out of total running SmartNode, it shows Payout Zone and I thought that was the most beautiful text I’ve been reading in a while. Being in the payout zone means that you have the chance to get paid anytime. The system would randomly pick randomly from the top 10% node for awarding. According to the info command, the worst case it could take some days. Lucky for me, I’ve got mine within 6 hours during my sleep as shown in the first picture. SmartNodeMonitor is more than just a monitoring bot but I’ve learnt a lot of useful facts via commands like faq and info. It provides real-time information like how many nodes are running in the network, average waiting time to reach payout zone, and much more. Go through all the commands if you can. This bot is available on Discord and Telegram with username @SmartNodeMonitorBot. After all, definitely feeling great to receive the 290 SMART reward especially the painfully long waiting time. The future rewards will be about after 10 days including the random waiting time within payout zone. Sunshine!

Save tons of effort managing the rigsWith the help of Hive OS, you can see all the rigs status in one place. With all the hashrates, online status, hardware errors and managing different wallets. Administration work like rebooting system, overclocking GPUs is also supported using merely the tools within. A wide range of GPUs has been tested working fine with Hive including NVIDIA GeForce card family, AMD Radeon RX(Vega is still under development), and even ASIC like the S9, S9i, L3+, L3++ and so on. Popular miners are pre-installed15 famous miners like Claymore, ETHminer, Bminer Equihash, and XMR-Stak are pre-installed on the platform so the user can skip the hassle of installing each one by one manually from the GitHub. This is the utmost important for miners with wider interest and does not stick to solely mining for a single coin. If you are running 10 rigs at the same time and decided to switch all the hash power for mining another algorithm, there is no centralised manner but to log in each rig one by one and do the necessary changes. With Hive OS everything can be done within clicks. Multiple Watchdogs and monitoring services are supportedTelegram bot service will be used to allow user notified of the mining farm performance. Notification will be sending out every time in the event of GPU errors, low hashrates or high electricity consumption. Besides that, watchdogs like WatchdogInUa, OpenDev, Esonics can be added on top of Hive OS as long as they support Linux. VerdictManaging mining rigs has never been this easy with the presence of Hive OS. The starting package is free for up to 3 rigs and beyond that, it would be $3 per month for each rig. I would say the cost is nothing for the time and effort being saved, what do you think about this platform?

His style of making lengthy but very informative blog posts really attracted me so much and I must admit I learnt a few things from him. When he said that he was all-in Steem by selling all of his stocks and altcoins which I still remember should be valued for about a total $60k when 1 STEEM was around $1, I was amazed seeing someone making a bold move like this. And for quite a long time(until now), I would say that was a kickass successful investment. Apart from that, he showed the public how a digital nomad(yes I regard he as one) lives in real life and some of the tricks he is using for creating content. He admitted that his lengthy posts were the outcome of voice-to-text translation but I don’t mind reading them as long as they are the quality one. He also used to run numerous of advertisement on FB and YouTube for the sake of Steem and that’s the biggest reason I gave him my witness vote when he is running the campaign. And things slowly change He stopped the advertising, producing content that doesn’t interest me it used to be, but that’s all okay as long as my chosen witness continue to contribute to the community, which is getting weaker every day as I can tell. Jerry started to make farces here and there on the platform. From the ingenious Steem sign-up fee for $50 to the SteemFest 2.5 and hilarious JerryBanfieldCoin, I can’t name it all. You may move to the better documentation if you are interested, I personally had a good time reading it. I had no admiration for this guy anymore I tend to not opening up his post for informative stuff but to check out what jokes he has made recently. And that could be the only reason why I’m still following Jerry. He seems to exploit every possible chance to make money even out of the thin air. I admire such aggressiveness in chasing the almighty cash but at least do it in a sane manner. Yes, you see it right, the cost to have a 1-on-1 calling session with this man is $810 per hour. I’m not sure if his time worth that much or I have something worth that much to share with him, but if you do, please feel free to drop a visit at:https://jerrybanfield.com/call/ Jerry’s desire for making money is abnormally strong for people like him, I don’t know him well he seems to like living a decent standard of life. He is smart and sometimes charming(controversial), that’s exactly why he could make it up to the top 20 witnesses and still is. At the same time, he is the most dramatic style(in a bad way) of a witness I’ve been seen and voted. I don’t need a witness like that. Jerry 是个非常具有戏剧性的的见证人之一，也是早期我最早认识的 Steem 网红之一。无可否认早期从他干货满满的文章里我确实学了不少东西，也颇享受阅读他的文章。可最近几个月发生的事情慢慢让我看清他的真面目了，总之就是无所不用其极的在赚钱。有兴趣的可以去这篇文章看看，把他所闹过的乌龙和闹剧都列出来了，有好些我是早已知道的。阅读完后碰巧有空就是顺手去取消投给他的见证人票了，他算是第一个我取消的见证人吧。 毕竟还是拖了太久，早就该这么做了。 Posted from my blog with SteemPress : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/removing-my-witness-vote-for-the-first-time-this-guy-is-disappointing This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Removing my witness vote for the first time, this guy is disappointing. | 取消见证人票’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/removingmywitnessvoteforthefirsttimethisguyisdisappointing-9cemovzqxj/"},{"title":"SmartCash#8 - Smartreward is good, but it can be great!","text":"Are there any ways to move out SMART without giving up the Smartrewards? Smartreward is a cool way to award holder of Smartcash and it is one of the big reasons I took dive into running my Smartnode. It encourages investor to hold on SMART coin by awarding more coins if the address with at least 1000 SMART doesn’t have any withdrawal record in last 30 days. This can be a double sword in my opinion. Especially with the current the rewarding mechanism. Smartreward can be more flexible Let say I’m running a Smartnode with 10k SMART in it. Over months I will have around 20k after adding in all the node reward and Smartreward. How can I move out the 10k for another new node without wiping the rewards from the remaining untouched 10k pool? No way, as of now. It is either you keep the extra coins on the same address and wasting its potential earning power. Or you sacrifice one-month worth reward, withdraw the excess coin for better use. It definitely spells as a big flaw to me, while I absolutely agree that removing coins from an address should void the reward to discourage devilish PnD activity, such mechanism can be further improved by either: 1) Adding grace period for fund management2) Allowing redirection of incoming reward to a specific address3) Instead of taking a snapshot at a specific moment, maybe consider taking snapshot of the average balance of address for last 30 days cycle?4) Making 1000 SMART as a unit. If user moving in and out 500 SMART and the Smartreward for the first 1000 SMART will be voided, while the remaining coins on the same address remain safe. Either one of above-mentioned suggestion could make our Smartcash smarter. There could be more ways of course and I believe there are more bright-minded in our community to make this mechanism better. Liquidity is key for a cash With the downside of losing whole SmartReward, people will be reluctant to move out the ‘extra SMART’ which could be used in setting up a new node. So the network is at constant risk of losing potential new node which can further enhance our network security. Furthermore, for someone who has a handsome amount of SMART which entitles for considerable reward especially Smartnode owners, we share all the same feeling that we make sure to think thrice before moving out and fund even for a dime. This would eventually contribute to a culture that everyone would prefer to hold their Smartcash instead of utilizing it the way it was designed for, a smart currency. VerdictI had this discussion with one of the community members in Telegram and he made a good point saying that a lost reward shouldn’t be taken as a penalty. Well, it is indeed a penalty when the system takes away more than what user deserve to claim. Moving out 50 coins would void my reward for the rest of my 9950 coins, while I’m adding more liquidity to make the whole ecosystem more healthy? Sound like almost a bad joke to me. What do you think about the current Smartreward system? Do you think there is a better way to implement it? This series is to record my SmartNode journey. This is very much a high risk experimental act and I’m prepared to lose all the fund invested. Do your own research as this is not a financial advice.

Although the mining frenzy is much chilled than before and the price of GPU seems to drop back to normal level. It is still not really a good timing to get one considering the GTX 10 Series is almost a 2-year old product.

But that is no way a promise nor a guarantee to secure a vote from the team in which they summed it well as follows : You don’t expect a tip, but you are happy when you get one. – Source However, if you are creating quality content and going through proper process(by using @vornix for instance) in utilising the Steempress plugin, getting an appreciation token from the team is likely. 2.

While Vornix still is a comoletely free service own your WP site, 15% of your post payout will be taken by the team with or without their votes. And if you think that a vote is guaranteed via the Steempress plugin, stop and refer to the Point 1. Instead of being defensive on the benefactor reward, why don’t taking that as a way to support @steempress-io? That would works the same way as directly tipping or delegate SP to the team.

Post on WordPress first instead of Steemit This soinds like obvious but believe me, many who first started blogging on Steem and don’t own a blog beforehand will not realise this fact. I’m one of them. It is especially a habitual change that must be adapted for existing Steemians. Every post from now on have to be posted first on your WordPress site `[username].vornix.blog’ and the Steempress plugin should take care of the publishing on Steem. It can be hard at first to adapt but the process will get much smoother as time goes by. 4.

Steemdice is simple as 123: Login with the Steem account with active key permission Place the Bet Amount either in STEEM or SBD. Set the Win Chance from 1 to 99. Roll the Dice! For example, you set Win Chance by 70 and roll the dice. Within a few second the Steemdice algorithm will get you a random number from 1 to 99 as well. If the generated number smaller than 70, you win, otherwise you lose. Told you it is dead simple right? Things to take note Steemdice is taking 2% from winning bet as house edge.

Don’t try to be frugal on everything. The regret Ever regret not to purchase something while it actually brings way more positive impact than your expectations after you pulled the trigger finally? Franco Kernel Updater is certainly one of it to me. Android enthusiast must be familiar with this famous Kernal developer who aims to boost phone’s battery life greatly. While the Franco Kernal only supports dev-friendly phones like the Google Nexus series and One Plus series, the phones I used for the past few years are all in the support list. Couldn’t believe I didn’t get it until now. Battery health at 85% I’m using the mighty One Plus 3 which is a 1.5 year-old phone and it still going strong, I really see no need in replacing it but there is 2 issues I’m currently facing. Relatively sub-par camera compared to crazy-ass 3 lenses phone(I can live with that) and the declining battery capacity which is critical to me. There is no way for me to source a factory battery in Singapore and I do not want to give the beloved phone up just because of battery life. Looking at the solution at system level and tried some tricks, battery life is still draining like waterfall. I recalled the legendary Franco Kernel updater and finally pulled the trigger, this is when the magic happened. Instant battery boost, amazingly. The app automatically download the kernel, flash and reboot the phone smoothly. I wasn’t expected everything will be done in one-go and was quite nervous since things like this could go wrong and I don’t have latest backup. A plus point for the smooth installation! I’ve been using this app for a few days and the battery life improvement is tremendously noticeable. Got almost 5 hours of On-Screen-Time out of the 1.5 year-old 3000mah battery, could have been easily gone up to 6 hours if this is a brand new phone. Oh man, god knows how much I’ve missed for skimping on a $4.99 app. The configuration is simple I’m not gonna make a full introduction for this awesome app but you can help yourself over link below(no referral bonus unfortunately): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.franco.kernel&amp;hl=en_SG They have tons of features but I only make use of the “Battery life labs”. I have same performance(never wanted to sacrifice this for but way more battery juice for the setting below: Underclock the CPU by 25%.Underclock the GPU.Applied 20% lower max brightness.Installed Naptime and enabled Aggressive Doze. Awesome idle time from this app, simply a must-get. That’s all I did and all the setting will be loaded upon every reboot, so it is kind of a one-time setup.

The mandatory SmartCash V1.2.3 update I know SmartCash has been in a rapid development recently and there are several updates on the node program as well as wallet.

Close the old SmartCash desktop wallet if it is running, install the Node Client on the same directory of the original Smartcash wallet.Open the Node Client and you shall see everything inside the client is still the same as before, let it sync.Access the SmartNode/VPS, execute sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install smartcashd -y; smartcash-cli stop; smartcashd reindexsmartcash-cli getinfo should return “protocol version”: 90026 which is the latest protocol version”On the Node Client, Start alias the SmartNode and you shall see the status will change to ENABLED eventually in a few minutes.

And keeping up with all the mess like studying which Block Providers(BP) is worthwhile to take my vote, the voting process itself, and all kind of tools, not to mention mountains of phishing and scamming attempt that was targetting the hot-hearted EOS holders. Everything will be overwhelming and I don’t want to be part of it for this period. The last thing I did was to make sure my ETH address was properly registered and the EOS keypair is valid. Closed my crypto private key manager, ignored all the related news with the launching process and drove my attention elsewhere. Things have finally settled down The last thing I know about EOS is that it will be ported from ERC20 token to its mainnet. I’ve been lost track for so many things but at least I know currently it is much safer and easier to move around the fund. So the first thing came to my mind was that I got to find a wallet. That’s the idea, right? Import the private key and boom, everything should be available in it. After one hour of researching, it seems like the idea of a wallet is not really popular and most of the tools I found was all about voting for BPs. Nonetheless, there are some famous wallets found after I dug further down. They are the Greymass EOS-voter, simplEOS by the EOS RIO team and the most famous Scatter browser plugin. simplEOS seems like the one closest to my imagination The elegant web page has grabbed my attention the most I have to admit that(Yes, I’m a highly visual animal). It supports more features other than just hosting EOS token (of course!): Token transferContacts listSupport multiple accountsVoting portalCreate new accountsStake/unstake The wallet itself is lightweight and have a clean cut UI at the same time. Absolutely do not need a handbook or manual to use it. Input the private key and everything shows up perfectly including all the airdrop tokens. The team have a clear planned roadmap as well, from permission management to mobile app version. Looks like they already doing a great job and definitely earning my first vote as a BP. Saved up the earlier stage of troubles at the same time missed out another x100 opportunity Yeah, I mean the EOS RAM trading which is the hottest topic for these few days. In fact, this is the exact reason for bringing me back to look at the EOS and try to understand what is going on in this extremely new place. Made me can’t help but fell into the “What if I knew it earlier” illusion, could have 100x my EOS and I should be able to quit the day job and catch a breath. OK, those are pointless but I guess there are still plenty of opportunities incoming especially sidechain solution to solve the current ridiculous RAM war. I shall keep a close eye on the project now.

If you don’t count the Steemit personal page as one. Apart from all the backend stuff, the biggest difference between creating content on Steem and personal site is the target audience. On Steem we are basically talking to the ‘Steemian’ in mind while in personal site, the world wide web is the audience. Steem content should mean for everyone on the Internet as well As Steemit.com rise to the top 1000 in Alexa ranking, more and more content will be ended up in the list of search result from worldwide people. Unless you are the Steem witness, or posting something very Steem-centric like development and community based event, you should always keep the writing style as opened as possible. This can be applied to most of the general categories like photography, travel, food, life, education, and many more. Write to the world Write as in you are not only writing to the Steemians, but to the world wide audience as well. Readers who have no idea what Steem is, will have no idea what you were trying to bring out in the content. They don’t know what is the project names you were mentioning and what are those @xxx you kept tagging(these Steem mentions will appear as normal text in WordPress site). Therefore, there will be no connection between the content and readers because the content is not talking to them. Make the content more non-Steemian friendly Try to share only the general topic post on the Wordpress site.Reduce the usage of specific greeting like Hi Steemian!Aurthoring a post with the non-Steemian perspective in mind. Ask yourself, will I understand what I’m saying without knowing Steem in the first place? Verdict Even without running own personal blogging site, this should be a great idea by address the audience to the world wide and public one. Facebook users don’t call out the others as Facebookers, YouTube viseo makers are not addressing the audience as youtubers After all we have the same dream of making this place as good as the above-mentioned one.

Do not waste the potential of any idling resources. 太长没读：把 VPS 上闲置的 CPU 算力投入到挖矿中竟然带来了意想不到的收益，加上运行超级节点的收益应该就胜过了 VPS 的月费，而我却花了一个月多才领悟到这个道理。任何闲置的资源都很可能是被遗忘的钞票机啊！ Making use of idle CPU power I’m running a masternode of SmartCash project on a VPS from the Privex. The Steem-accepting VPS has been awesome, 99% uptime and least hassle of setting up. But one day when I came across the CPU-mining concept, I realised this VPS could makes some profit using its idle CPU power. I chose the Intense coin which is running a proof-of-work Cryptonight mining algorithm. Let’s do the breakdown of how this mining works on the VPS: Zero electricity fee as the VPS is already running for the masternode.Could have makes some extra bucks to cover the server fee($8 per month).Make full use of the idle hashing power. Proof of concept Out of the Prived V1 plan with dual-core CPU, the Intense coin mining on the VPS has been running for a while and this is the hashing performance graph. Let’s take 150 H/s as average hashrate for the next calculation. Using this calculator, 150 hashrate with 0 power cost and 1% pool fees gets to mine coins equivalent to $0.14 a day, $0.93 a week and $4.34 a month. Out of the monthly $8 cost for the VPS, making full use of its CPU hashing power would make more than half the money back already without taking the real SmartCash masternode profit into account. I was quite blown away the moment I found out the posibility to actually gain more real money out of the VPS investment. Don’t stop being creative with idle resources The CPU power was left idling for quite a long while until I started to step into the amazing mining field. Any idle resources could be another wasted money printing machine but the catch is you should know how to capitalize the full use of it in the right way. In my VPS, running a masternode and mining via CPU hashing power is not yet the best to gain most value back from the cost. More masternodes could be simply implemented in the same VPS as they normally consume least CPU and network bandwidth. Keep learning and experiment, the tech world is awesome!

Unfortunately, those bloatwares are installed together with the operating system and you cannot find them in the Uninstall Program list. Though the powershell commands do offer an alternative to get rid of those apps, it is no simpler than using 10AppsManager. 10AppsManager is a simple tool to uninstall/reinstall the bloatwares with just one click. I could not provide more picture because it has only one interface and that’s it. Work flawlessly and why you should reduce unwanted apps: Windows startup gets a lot quicker without having to load all these unnecesary apps. Gain extra CPU processing power(tested and proven myself.) Make your operating system truly yours with just a few clicks. You don’t have to delete all of the apps. The rule of thumb is, delete whatever you never opened or did not even know they existed before. Keep those you actually know and use, I kept the Photos for instance.

Build there is a reason why I just decided to start my all-time favourite gaming after building up my gaming rig for a year? I knew I wasn’t ready to hug the privilege of gaming all day long without having to worry about everything else. I would gaming till the end of the world if only I could, believe me. But the lack of security got the best of me Putting food on the table(for myself), paying bills and all sorts of survival needs in the city keeps reminding me there are more important things which should get most of my attention currently. I know, gaming should be leisure and casual and maybe I just worried too much. But I find no fun in the process of enjoying something yet deep in my mind there is a voice keep telling me “it’s time to sleep you have to wake up early for work”. Screw the morning alarm, screw the boss, screw the job. Nah, I’m just kidding. I will be sleeping on the street immediately after losing the job. I can no longer indulge in the pure joy of gaming the way I gamed as a kid. I’m the only one who is feeing myself. Not to mention, I’ve spotted so many opportunities to strengthen the feeding ability after joining the crazy crypto world. To say the least, Steem could be in my top 5 list of best money-making tools. Why not monetizing the leisure gaming? Since everything is ready and there are no reasons to stop me from picking up the deeply loved gaming hobby, I have an idea to make the time-wasting activity less guilty. While gaming is consuming the content prepared by the game developer, why not record it down and share it out via brilliant Steem platform? @dlive and @dtube was the first two application came to my mind with this idea, obviously. I know there are many who already live streaming their gaming experience or just record it down and share it afterwards. I just never thought of actually doing that myself. Turn out that could be a really awesome idea. I could record the whole gaming process down and selectively trim it down to a meaningful clip. Not being an FPS, PUBG or Dota fan, I love to play single-player games and there are many big titles in this genre like the GTA 5, Witcher series, Dark Soul series just to name a few. I could share how to complete certain missions or just to show off some fancy battle scenes. Even the audience is not the players of the same game, the ultra high graphics gaming playthrough can already be treated as a mini-movie. And the best part is, those clips stand a chance to win some votes too! This is what I hope will compensate a little for the gaming guilt after all. Alright, gaming + Dlive that’s the combo. TLDR: Finally decided to start gaming while record the process down and share it on Steem via dlive or dtube just to earn a few extra bucks and reduce the guilty feeling of wasting time. 太长没读: 终于决定了捡起最爱的打机（打电动）爱好，把其中有趣的过程记录下来放在 Steem 上不只可以成为另一个内容输出，还可以有机会赚到些许点赞，罪恶感大大降低啊！ All images are taken from unsplash.com Posted from my blog with SteemPress : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/this-is-the-only-way-i-can-start-gaming-without-feeling-guilty/ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘This is the only way I can start gaming without feeling guilty’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/thisistheonlywayicanstartgamingwithoutfeelingguilty-ezs50d2ue6/"},{"title":"Awesome logo designer on Steem","text":"Decided to share my gaming experience but not wanted to mix it up with the focus of current account, the best way is to set up another account and do all the gaming related stuff there.

People are worried that the designated reward pool for this Airdrop will run dry soon but you can chill now. Yesterday the Byteball guy @punqtured just announced that there is 326,989 GByte left to be claimed from all the Steemians. That means $43,803,446 worth of Gbytes are still waiting to be distributed. 43,803,446/160=273771, assuming all the unclaimed Steemians are all over 70 Reputation, it will take 27377 of them to fully deplete the Airdrop. So don’t you worry. Take your time and perhaps give a little pump to your rep before attesting to the airdrop. What is the reward? The best thing this attestation is not depending on the SP at all but Reputation. Which means everyone including minnows will have fairer chance to claim reward as follow: Steem reputation above 30: you get a $10 rewardSteem reputation above 40: you get a $20 rewardSteem reputation above 50: you get a $40 rewardSteem reputation above 60: you get a $80 rewardSteem reputation above 70: you get a $160 reward My free Bytes is strictly for NEW users only I will continue to send free Byteball for the Steem Attestation as long as the users are proven to be truly new. With that said, I will check for the following: The Byteball address provided should not have any balance.User should not request Byteball from other Steemians before my send. Violating any condition above I will take you as not a new Byteball user anymore, hence no fund from me to you. Also, this is to prevent Byteball-hunting as well. How to get free Byteball?

Byteball has established theri brand for a while in the crypto space and the coins can easily be cashed out, that is why it was so hot after the announcement. But I would like to talk more about the most lucrative reward for this event, the referal system! How lucrative is it? The referral gets exactly the same reward as the new user*’s reward. A new 70 rep Steemian gets $160 and so do you if they happend to be under your reference. While is sounds like a totally great idea for promote Byteball as hars as possible, there is some tricks to game the referral system and exploit the reward. First, you need to know how the system define the referrer. Difficult questions Question: What if a user clicked a referral link and paid with funds sent to him from another attested user? Answer: The user providing the funds will be the referrer, not the one from the link.Question: What if there were multiple inputs from several attested users being used to pay for an attestation?Answer: The input that is closest but not less than the output required will be the referrer.Question: What if the user didn’t spend my funds, but instead signed a message?Answer: Then nobody will be the referrer of that attestation. Taken from the post: https://steemit.com/steemit/@punqtured/network-issues-over-the-weekend-and-questions-about-steem-attestations You should read it if you have more intesrest on what was the network issue lately and more information about the airdrop. Highly exploitable referral game Ultimately, the referral link is practically useless. The decisive factor is whose fund the new user used for the Steem attestation. That’s why having the new users commenting their wallet address in the public area is a good way to lose the referral reward for post owner. Because all the reward hunters would just send the minimum fund(about $0.08) to new addresses. Someone is even creating some bots tapping on Steem API to track Byteball wallet address over all the network and send funds. I heard people are making a few thousands dollar just over a few days. Crazy world.

Not long ago after I attempted the former method to get into the mining world, I learnt a great stuff about this new superstar – FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). While FGPA is not a new technology which in invented in the 1985, it was originally created for use in space, satellites and communication specialized equipment. A company called Zetheron started to customize the FPGA card for cryptocurrency mining purpose. What is FPGA vs other mining hardware? I had a great read of the company’s detailed article about the *FPGA Mining Overview and below are some summaries: In term of parallelism of every processing element, CPU &lt; GPU &lt; FPGA.Unlike CPU and GPU, FPGA can only be programmed at the lowest possible level which is the RTL(register transfer level) via language like Verilog and VHDL.Xilinx is the inventor of FPGA and still is the largest seller now.The amount of internal memory inside the FPGA is a very important metric for performance.Bitstream is the configuration file that specifically written for a FPGA with specific purpose.Non-volatile configuration is more robust against power outages which can be loaded every time miner is rebooted.The rapid reconfiguration function of FPGA has the ability to allow FPGA to completely reconfigure itself in a fraction of a second, making it unbeatable by competitor like the ASIC.FPGA can only mine one algorithm at a time generally. Verdict To me, the biggest advantage of FPGA is that it can use the equal or lesser power comsumption but produce 10~100 times the hashrate one GPU could generate, without the deady shortcoming of ASIC at all, which is the inability to mine different algorithm. The disadvantage, however, is the price and its uncertainty of how this mining game would play out in the near future. A working FPGA card would easily cost 3k USD and I think that is quite steep for a casual miner like me to invest. I’m certainly interested in this technology as it is a no-brainer winner comparing to the GPU in term of efficiency. TLDR: FPGA is the new star in mining cryptocurrency. Low power consumption, much higher hashrate and flexibility in switching algorithm. 太长没读： FPGA 是目前的挖矿神器，低电力消耗（和 GPU 一样或少过），几倍甚至百倍的算力，还可以任意切换不同的币种（要是软件支持）。绝对是目前挖矿性价比最高的方式之一。 Did you get your free Byteball yet?Posted from my blog with SteemPress : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/can-fgpa-be-the-killer-of-gpu-asic-mining/ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Can FGPA be the killer of GPU/ASIC mining?’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/canfgpabethekillerofgpuasicmining-w6k3lyypnc/"},{"title":"The Dwarf FPGA miner scam","text":"I’ve been paying close attention to the development of FPGA mining lately and the best source of such information of course still have to count on the old-school Bitcointalk forum.

EOS the top, Steem the 7th, and BitShares the 10th Wow, this list is much in favor to the legendary @dan aka the ByteMaster. All of his 3 projects made it to the top 10, the potential of Graphene framework and DPoS mechanism are highly recognized here.

Maybe now can be a good entry point as it is at the lowest price after the all time high $32.

The mechanism of this game somehow is taking advantage of weak hand which I would explain later. Simply put, this is a game to earn ETH(Ethereum) as passive income by holding the P3D tokens. Every trade(buying/selling) would have to pay 10% fee in term of ETH and this fee is not going to the devs or game creator but to all the holders of P3D. Are you trying to scam me?I wish I could. In POWH3D, you don’t have to trust anyone as there is no human involved at all. I mean, players is just trading with a deployed smart contract which running on the Ethereum network. Yes, everything is handled by the contract, a pile of codes. Buying P3D selling ETH, selling P3D for ETH, the price of the P3D, distribution of fees to tokens holders, masternode referral reward assignment, everything is executed by the smart contract. If you able to read codes, here is the full source code for the smart contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0xb3775fb83f7d12a36e0475abdd1fca35c091efbe#code The contract is just 800 lines which should not be difficult for some simple auditing, in this video The Crypt is making a full running through an explanation for the codes. This smart contract has been audited by some experience smart contract engineers and the feedback was all positive. So there is nobody to scam you, the smart contract is not going to run away with all the fund within it as long as the code still intact. How is this project attractive?While many claims that a crypto project should not have existed if it weren’t created to solve the real world problem, and POWH3D is a total pyramid-schemed money game which producing no value at all. I agree every bit of the former part, however POWH3D does solve some real-world problem. If we have to admit money games are not going to anywher as long as greed exists , POWH3D creates a perfect system to make a pyramid scheme, money game, or whatever equivalent running on a completely honest and transparent level where no one could abuse. Code is the law, not a single human is able to touch the fund. The team makes everything transparent and dealing the game with utter honesty, you can actually learn everything from the official site. This game did not make any promises on the return and did not intend to at all, unlike the Bitconnect, making $100 a day remember? The contract already has a massive stake, 80k of ETH at present. The team is good at making games that base on human greed, and such games always go viral easily and all the P3D holders will be rewarded from the result of other games. The best example is the hottest chick in town, FOMO3D. Income generated from other product makes POWH3D not a zero-sum game anymore. What is the risk?The biggest risk to me is the integrity of smart contract code. If someone finds a loophole or bug in the contract they can easily drain all the ETH in the wallet. But having all the seasoned contract engineers approved the codes and with so much money inside the wallet(80k ETH at present), I believe the wallet was under constant hacking attempt, yet it still standing strong today. This fact makes me feel comfortable. Alright, what if everyone dumping the token? Will the token be worthless? To be honest, as a money game token P3D is kinda worthless as it would not brings in real value if you want to buy service/product with it. All it does is just collecting passive ETH income from other’s trading fee. Everyone dumping the token is one of the best things that could happen to the strong hands in the game. Don’t forget all the selling off will incur a 10% fee which goes to the token holders. At present, there is 80,000 ETH in the contract and let’s do some simple math. 80,000*10% = 8,000 ETH will be distributed to the strong hand. Let say you are the one last man standing in the game, your portion in the distribution is getting bigger as the P3D holders are decreasing. Don’t forget the name of this game, weak hand is going to feed the strong hand. In another word, what to lose even if the token dumping can be profitable? VerdictI know this article is full of shilling for this controversial project where many people called scam or Ponzi. But seriously did you even study how the whole thing works before claiming as such? I did my research and I found the system design to be impressively exquisite.

A “bag holder” is an informal term used to describe an investor who holds a position in a cryptocurrency which decreases in value until it is worthless. In most cases, the bag holder will hold the position for an extended period during which most of the investment is lost. If one fanatically hodls cryptocurrency, especially shitcoins, they risk becoming a bag holder. This term could be applied in other financial assets as well but it fits better to crypto to me. Imagine a poor guy holding a bag full of Bitcoins from from the All-time-high $20k to zero in the house, damn that hurts! Alright ignore my lame joke, the probability for that to happen might be slimmer than someone accidentally send over 1000 BTC to my address. Quick reflection as a Hodler My phisolophy as a crypto investor is always “Go big or go home” which easily expose me to a very high risk of becoming a bag holder. The truth is, before making any investment the first question to ask myself was always “What if this shit goes to zero one day?” If the answer was selling to cut loss, I’d probably not taking the dive. Looking at my portfolio, the worst investment was the AMLT and NVST coin which came from ICO investment. The former was following a trading signal and the latter was even funnier, I saw that ICO advertisement on the Coinmarketcap and thinking to join the ICO for the first time was kinda cool. I had no chance to become a bag holder for these two coins as there are worthing shit since launching. I have half of the holdings in red number now, gotta hodl as usual. Let’s hope I’m not going to become a bag holder anytime soon. Bag Holder 我不知道在中文的翻译是什么，不过意思就是某个人持有特定的资产，一直贬值直到为零都不曾放手。同样的道理也可以运用在加密货币身上。看到这个有趣的经济词汇，对身为 Hodler 的我有点当头棒喝的意思。这些年来我手上价值变零的币应该只有两个，就是该死的 AMLT 和 NVST。都是从 ICO 买回来的，严格上来说我还不能算是 Bag Holder， 因为它们一推出价值就是几乎为零了。唉，说起来都心酸。看着手上还持有的币币们，希望不会它们不会有天真的让我成为 Bag Holder 吧.

Any seasoned or even new crypto investor will easily find their coins and tokens scattered on a wide distributed places like exchanges, personal wallets, mining pool, and so on. I’ve attempted to make a one-stop solution to view my crypto portfolio at one glance but ended up having a few applications with different killer features where the others lack, I was so desperate that I even created a fully customized Excel sheet but none of these really matter anymore with the Bitsnapp. Following will be an in-depth review of this application after some intensive usage for a week. Breeze-like overview of all assets The main page Assets is the all-in-one place to show all the crypto holdings by either wallets, exchanges API, Watch-only coins and so on. The top bar shows the total holding value in term of BTC or chosen default currency which is USD in my case. The page is clean with the Basic setting which mainly shows the coin names, changes in 24H, holding amount and equivalent value in BTC and fiat. Awesome readability credits to the neat interface and sorting method that I often able grep all the information with just a few scrolls. The dark theme of the app is not yet adjustable but it works great with the white-colored font, enhanced the contrast to a just-right level. It leads me to think that the News section should use the same configuration for better readability, more on that later. Scrolling and data refreshing is rather smooth and I’ve never experienced any laggy movement by far. If you would like to extract more data on the Assets page, simply switch to the Full view from the right panel where consolidates all the page controls such as collapse/expand listing, sync holdings, sorting and so on. Many other portfolio apps I’ve been using does not provide simple feature like this and the dashboard could look like a disaster if you track more than 10 coins. Strong wallet tracking ability The second panel Wallet is mainly used for adding coins on the Assets page. Other than the normal New Entry feature which user can define any random entry on any coins, I see the Track Address as a surprise here. Manually entering entries is going to be troublesome for active traders because they will have to alter the coins amount after every trading, obviously not a sustainable strategy unless for some buy-and-forget-coin. Track Address however, offers a really dynamic and flexible way to monitor flowing of coins by pinpointing the eye on the wallet address itself. Oh, did I mention the killer feature here in the Track Address, the Smart Track feature? It was designed to auto check the tokens carried by platform coins like the Ethereum. Put in the ETH address and ticking the Smart Track would enable the apps to track all ERC-20 tokens that tie to the main address. A very handy function that I’ve never seen in any portfolio manager app before! Looking at the Charts(gif at your right side) for an immediate snap at portfolio assignment as a whole 100%. This statistic would be crucial for those traders who practice portfolio rebalancing tactic which realigning the weightings of different assets to a preset threshold. The Charts will easily be showing the which coin worth the most in the portfolio and which worth the least. A better understanding of portfolio is fundamental to success in the overwhelming crypto space. I personally track all my coins in Bitsnapp by tracking the address plus adding exchange API(from Binance and Kucoin). No more editing the entries manually for every transaction instead I just have to hit the refresh button every time I want to know the latest information of holdings. The only drawback is, while Bitsnapp is supporting almost 2000 cryptos, the Track Address is supporting only about 50 coins. This could only be countered by adding the coins manually in the New Entry. Hope the team would work more on this by adding more platform coins. Nonetheless, Track Address still comes in really handy as it covered all the major players in the market. Hit the addictive News section only if you are free There is no other space with a faster pace than the crypto. With the News section, one can easily catch up with all the important information from famous sources like CoinTelegraph, CoinDesk and several famous subreddit pages. The first sight at the Sources page annoyed me a little bit because it was all hard-coded and do not allow users to add their favourite sources. Those pre-defined selection will hardly meet my news reading requirements. But I was wrong. The algorithm of picking up news from the defined sources is smart enough to fill the page up with interesting and eye-catching titles. On the first visit I was unknowingly surfing the news for 1 hour(I’m a crypto freak), definitely a potential time killer feature I would say. Try to open this section up when you are not in a busy schedule is the only advice I might suggest. Lastly, the font color is my only complaint as mentioned before. I have hard times to skim through the dark-green font news title from the black background sometimes. It would be great if the white-color font can get in and enhance the readability like how it looks in the Assets page. VerdictI simply could not ask for more features from a crypto portfolio application like Bitsnapp. The fact is, I chose to ignore a lot of other useful features which you might have to see across multiple of different apps. Such as the Fingerprint and custom PIN app lock, Real-time market data and historical charts, Alert system, just to name a few. This review focused on the killer features that I found interesting and deserve more highlight, but all the minor complementary features are what making this app so comprehensive and user-friendly. If you are suffering from scattered information and looking for a do-it-all-in-one-place crypto portfolio tracker, look no further.

The idea is, I’m not going to snipe he active pot to win over the large lump sum of ETH, but to buy some KEYs as early as possible when a new round starts. So that I can get use the cheapest cost to earn some dividend as long as the particular round is not ending. Since the previous few rounds was ended around 50~70 ETH, I tried to join during 60s ICO period where all the keys are selling at the same price. Unfortunately I missed that and entered when the active pot was around 22 ETH. One key cost around 0.09 ETH and I bought 4 keys. The total cost is around 0.35 ETH and once the fund is sent, they are as good as gone. Now all I hold is 4 KEYs and hoping that round would last longer so that system could keep paying me dividend from those who buy the KEYs later than me. Yes, I was fascinated by the game mechanism but hating the feeling of not able to control my earning at the same time. The round ended at 30 something ETH in the pot I did not particulary know the exact amount of total pot amount since the tool is not ready for this purpose yet. But the last time I saw the round was alive and the fund is at 30+ ETH 1 hour before I see the game has started a new round.

I made an excel sheet with some little customized feature just to keep track of the prices. More than half of them are coins/tokens with big names so I was able to roughly keep up with the news from everyday reading. The rest are occupied by new/wild/under-the-radar coins which I have high hope of bringing huge fortune if I’m lucky enough(I was naive, still am.). Hence, for this portion of coins I would rather just glance through the price list and move on. Moreoever, most of these unknown coins did not even make to the Coinmarketcap which my excel sheets grab the price API from. It would be so troublesome for me to tracing each of them even it is on monthly basis. But the NVO is special, it was my first ever ICO investment. How did I get into this ICO? It was a silly start. May 2017, CMC has just became one of my most visited sites and one day I noticed the advertisement banner on the top bar. Yes, it was the ICO ads for the NVO. I was thinking “*Wow, this is what every one was talking about, the ICO, cool!” Without a second thought, I quicly sent over a minor fraction of my BTC(which I can’t remember how much already) from the Exodus wallet to the ICO address and boom! I completed my first ever ICO investment and got the NVST tokens, how cool this is! Not long after that ICO, I knew I made a silly move. I’m not saying I knew this is a shitty project at that moment but I was kind of caught in the FOMO emotion without realizing there are many more ICO project out there. And I should have do more research on it before the dive. “Anyway, god only knows if this coin would rockets one day.” It did not. And keep tanking since the completion of ICO. During my last check upon the project development(was expecting for a 100% loss long time ago), to my surprise the team announced a refund to the ICO investor at the price of 0.00009292961 BTC/NVST.

The keyword here is Turing Completeness. C, C++, C#, (Visual) Basic, Pascal, Python, Java, Ruby, Objective C, Perl, Swift, and so on are all Turing complete programming language that has been used to create masses of software and programs. To achieve Turing completeness, a particular must be able to complete this 6 primitive: Right: Move the Machine’s head to the right of the current squareLeft: Move the Machine’s head to the left of the current squarePrint: Print a symbol on the current squareScan: Identify any symbols on the current squareErase: Erase any symbols presented on the current squareNothing/halt: Do nothing Maybe this little video would help you better in understanding the theory. In short, any languages can achieve this six primitives can solve any computaional problems(regardless of effectiveness) which also reveal the my biggest, constant question in the mind: Anything that can be done in a programming language can be done as well in other languages. Provided they are Turing complete, of course. Being someone who always fancy of the power of programming but not willing to fork out the time and effort to learn one(shameful, but I’m picking up now), the constant questions in my head were probably “Can Python replace Javascript?“ “What this feature be done in C instead of R?“ The answer is probably yes, most of the time. In fact, a better question is, Is X language more effective than Y language in programming Z function?

I have a deeper understanding of the blockchain than my average peers prior to this reading, but reading this 9-page PDF gave me another chance of witnessing what a great whitepaper/thesis should be like. Below are some highlighted notes which interested and wowed me after the consumption: 1) If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. After reading much of other voting systems in all kind of blockchains, it is an interesting perspective to interpret the electricity-consuming proof-of-work activity as voting with CPU power. This is exactly what happens in the POW. Much like with the DPOS voting mechanism like EOS/Steem, who could gather more miners(gaining witness votes) and afford to spend more electricity(stake more Steem power), have more power in getting more coins. 2) To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they’re generated too fast, the difficulty increases. I constantly have a problem in understanding how is the mining difficulty be determined. This sentence explained in a simpler way but I think digging deeper into the technical part would be more helpful in getting the clearer picture. 3) Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it. In other words, the attacker is almost impossible to take over the longest and honest chain because, in order to do that, he will have to rework all the previous blocks while catching up with the latest increasing blocks. Man, it would be easier for betting on the Dogecoin to dethrone Bitcoin over the crypto ranking. 4) Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation-free. While there is less than 20% of Bitcoin to be mined and the block reward expected to be halved in the coming early June 2020, I once wondered what would keep the miners incentivized to secure the network. Seems like they will be living fully on the transaction fee by then. With technology like the Lightning Network incoming to reduce the fee by a large extent, it sounds like a conflict of interest here in the short future. 5) Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back the money he recently spent. This is referred to the event of a successful attack on the honest chain, it doesn’t mean an attacker could generate new coin out of thin air nor taking coins from other’s wallet. Double-spending is all he can do. Of course, he can still proceed all the wrong-doings on this own chain but it is subjected to the majority miners whether to continue investing computing power to acknowledge it. Owning a chain which is owned by a single entity worthless. 说来惭愧，在币圈混迹了一年多直到今天才朝圣了白皮书始祖，不好意思了， Satoshi先生！尽管里头很多概念已经是耳熟能详，还有好些 concept 也让人读来由耳目一新的感觉： 1） Proof-of-work 其实就是用 CPU 来投票的一种运作方式，和 Steem 上买 SP 投见证人票上没什么本质上的不同。2） 挖矿难度时取决于一个小时的出块速度，出块越快难度越高。3） 节点永远会倾向认为最长的链就是诚实的链。4） 当最后一个比特币被挖完（也就是 2020 年六月左右），矿工的将全面被交易费取代。5） 当区块链攻击成功，攻击者能做的最多就是二次消费（double-spending），而不是凭空生币和偷别人钱包里的币。 Posted from my blog with SteemPress : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/did-you-read-the-first-ever-created-whitepaper/ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Did you read the first ever created whitepaper? | 白皮书始祖’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/didyoureadthefirstevercreatedwhitepaper-ftmh8n0rk5/"},{"title":"Digital Art first attempt - Drawing my big-headed nephew | 数码绘画大头之处女作","text":"Device: Ipad Pro 2017 and PencilApp: Procreate I was intented to draw it with realistic style but obviously I failed a little.

Regretted not so sell some to keep the profit while everything is raging, regretted throwing BTC for some random shitcoin ICO. But Steem is an exception I still have no idea why this awesome project doesn’t get much traction at the price while it’s community and activity on the chain would probably be greater than all the higher ranks coins combined. It came out as a social media platform but has transformed into something which is bigger than that. You can do tons of things without blogging and posting comments at all and experience the advantages of the tech. Feeless, 3s transaction, and the freaking part are, the community is developing new Dapps on the network like they are working for the Steemit.inc but they are not. Some are doing it for personal profit, some are purely for the welfare of the ecosystem. This speciality alone is making Steem so much more superior to many other competitors and it is one of the biggest reasons I still have much faith in it.

The ultimate Adobe Suite pirating tool: CCMaker Get them via the link below or any sources that you find reliable: https://www.reddit.com/r/MSToolkit/comments/89zowg/ccmaker_v136_download/ Some notes to take before installing the download: Be extra cautious when choosing the sources to download, the Reddit link above is reputable enough. Always check against the checksums of the downloaded files with the hash provided from the sources. Be careful if the source did not provide one. HashCheck is one of the most convenient tools I ever used for checksum purpose. Most anti-virus is likely to detect the file as a threat due to the false positive algorithm. CCMaker let users download all the versions of different Adobe products and install it and finally, authenticate/crack it with the famous AMTEmu which is a software protection emulator specially tailored-made to get rid of the authorization mechanism of Adobe programs. In other words, AMTEmu can work without CCMaker at all provided you can source the authentic AMTEmu program from the Internet which is difficult nowadays as I couldn’t locate one myself. With the standalone AMTEmu, you can go to the official Adobe and download all the products you want and crack them with this tool. This way you are likely to bypass the risk of a funny altered version of Adobe version. I would just stick with CCMaker for the ultimate convenience and reputation. And the only bad thing is that it is not open source, I gotta trust someone that this tool is not gamed before my download. If you are extremely paranoid but do not wish to spare the expensive Adobe subscription fee, get the CCMaker and use it in a virtual machine.

Charlie Lee, the founder of LTC was one of the targets in the discussion due to his disputable action of selling all his LTC stake back in the Dec 2017 where cryptos were riding on a huge bull run. Side note to that, I personally found that to be quite a fascinating investment move by someone with a bright mind and does not agree he deserved to be assaulted on that. Under the huge public pressure of shorting the Litecoin, he decided to respond to the potentially harmful FUD via a series of tweets, here is the summary: LTC is the most secured cryptocurrency protected by $150MM worth of ASIC miners.Adoption in LTC is high given the supported LTC pair in many exchanges and multiple payment processors.LTC has the best working record. Running flawlessly for 7 years.His personal sellout was not moving the market price at all. He is still working full-time on LTC’s adoption.

Basically Steem has 4 keys starting from owner, active, posting, and memo, while EOS mainly comes with owner and active keys originally, while allowing user to customize permission with new keys. Owner key in both system acting as the master key which having the highest level of permission and capable of signing every operation within the network. For example, active key can only signing operation that is currency-related such as sending fund or delegation to another account, but cannot approve administrative operation like recover lost account, and reset all private keys like owner key. The main difference is, a Steem account can only have one definite master key which is the owner key, changing the owner key will reset all the private keys for active, posting, and memo at the same time. EOS has independent private key for each owner and active key, reset one doesn’t affect the other one. Create new EOS accountDownload the latest Greymass wallet. Tools -&gt; Key Generator -&gt; Generate Key. A new key pair should be generated immediately and you should back it up to multiple copies in some other safe places. Click any tabs in the wallet and the keypair would be gone and there is no way you could recover it back, as the wallet does not save these keypairs within the application. Generate 2 keypairs as we would use them for owner key and active key registration in the account creation later. You could use the same key pair for both keys but generally it is a better idea to use a different key pair for better security. Exposing the active private key will not risking the owner key integrity so there are still chances for you to recover the whole account. Secondly, go to the Create Account in the left panel. Input public keys from the 2 generated keypairs into owner and active key column. Assign a 12-characters account name(has to be a unique one) and 4000 bytes for the RAM amount depending on minimum requirement. 4KB of RAM should suffice at the moment, I heard the devs saying that would be reduced in the future. Delegate some bandwidth and CPU in term of EOS. I would just put 10 for each, in this case, to make sure I can operate freely with the new account. Press Create Account and this operation would be broadcast to the EOS network and it might take a while to be confirmed. After it the transaction is irreversible, simply import the new account in the same Greymass wallet by Manage Wallets function on the left panel, and Import Accounts.

No ways work better a single picture to tell the story in a blog and I have been focusing on the formatting to make the blog looks good and reading friendly. That could mean a lot of learning curves in Markdown language which I never heard of prior to joining Steem. Sometimes a little HTML tricks to deal with unique formatting that Markdown could not achieve. But I never pay attention to another important element in my blog, the screenshot or whatever graphic elements. The trick is simple - Adding drop shadow effect under the picture Take a look at the comparison below, the above screenshot is snipped normally with Windows snipping tool without any effect and the bottom one is accompanied by a shadow effect. Although both pictures will bring out the same meaning but undoubtedly the bottom image looks more aesthetically pleasing. The reason behind is simple, a drop shadow below the image object will gives the main object some depth of view. As in the image is floating above the canvas hence looks more real. How to do it? There are many ways to add a shadow effect to any picture. The most complicated one could be the Photoshop way but I’m not so dedicated enough to tune up every single of my graphic content via PS. The simpler way could be making use of the Microsoft Word editing ability. However, ShareX beat them both ShareX is simply a godlike screen capturing tool that meets each of my needs. Open source so that you don’t have to worry about the safety issue.Lightweight that cost almost nothing on the OS.Zero Advertisement so nothing bothers you while using it.Tons of features complimenting the screenshot ability.Free because it is open source! Configuration of ShareX for the shadow effect Install the ShareX, right-click on the icon under the toolbar and select Task Settings. On the left panel, select Effects and choose Image effects configuration. Add -&gt; Filters -&gt; Shadow for new shadow effect to configure. This is my configuration but you always welcome to experiment and create a unique effect to your liking. The right portion would be the preview pane for the configuration. To make the shadow adding process more fluent, right-click the ShareX icon under toolbar and go to After capture tasks then Add image effects/watermask. This will allows ShareX to auto implement the shadow effect after every capture task so there will be no need for the manual effect rendering process. Last tips While you can copy the captured task to the clipboard and conveniently upload to any image hosting service or Steemit/Busy.org text editor, the transparency for the shadow effect will be lost.

Download CutePDF and take note that this is the only working PDf converter software during my test. Install it and open Printer setting and select Manage on the CutePDf Writer. Select Printer properties, change the printer name to HP Printer literally, OK to save the setting. Set this printer as the default printer. Now open up the PDC file and here is another trick, the PDC file should be virgin which means it was never opened before. Else the printing button will be greyed out. If that is the case, proceed to download the PDC files again from publisher’s source or wherever you get the files from. Up to here, you should be able to print to PDF format and do whatever you want on it as if the true owner. However, it is advised to keep the extracted version to personal use only, unless you don’t mind to breach all the IP protection against the publisher.

Here are some facts that I learnt through the courses: Computer forensics is difficult, sometimes boring.Because there is so any rules and regulation to comply with. Anything an investigator do must follow strictly with all the procedures and policies so that the finding result could be claimed valid in the court. Opposing to the blackhat hacking which is ultra fun because there is no rules at all. The downside is only that always comes with legal responsibility. Computers forensics is not amateur friendlyA capable forensic investigator must have a very comprehensive set of toolkit in term of software and hardware in order to deal with all kind of computer assets. Looking at the overwhelming variation of computer hardware alone, preparing cables ans connectors for harddisk storage would cost a fortune. For example of forensic software, Encase is the gold standard that would cost 20k USD for a single license. Computer forensics is all about teamworkI really doubt if there is anyone who can handle every aspect of digital forensic at professional level. One must possess deep knowledge of computer science before capable of digging the ultra volatile digital evidence. From OS and database, to mobile and malware forensic, each of them could simply form a independent discipline in forenaic field.

It seems like the sudden surge of network usage has triggered the self-protection mechanism too early and we can very much relate this phenomena to the rising stars, Betdice and EOSBet, the biggest twin dapps in EOS network.

Basically, it allows all the operation that is supported in XML-RPC WordPress API to be executed provided the request have valid account credential, the username and password. To name a few, it can: Insert new postDelete postEdit postAdd commentGet any information related to the site. So you get the idea, almost everything that one can do with a Wordpress GUI as a site owner. These behaviour make xmlrpc.php worse Type in the URL column in such format https://yourwordpresssite.wordpress.com/xmlrpc.php and hit Return. Likely the returned result will be XML-RPC server accepts POST requests only. That means the xmlrpc.php file is on and ready to be called anywhere anytime while the site is staying alive. Plus this file mostly comes installed while setting up a new Wordpress site. Hackers are just 1 step away from controlling the whole site – getting the correct login credential. And the best part is(for hackers), they can just make a script to infinitely brute-force the username and password with no limitation of trying. Delete the file to be safe? Don’t need to be. While deleting the xmlrpc.php away or disable it through htaccess.php file are what most people would suggest doing in order to cover this Wordpress vulnerability, it is only true that if the site owner does not wish to make use of the powerful Wordpress API like making a bot to automated posting process. The best trick to maintain the usability of xmlrpc.php while not risking of compromising the whole is simple, rename the xmlrpc.php to another name. Any random name will do. For the best result, make it as complicated and long as your Crypto private key. Guessing the correct name of original xmlrpc.php would take a long while for any malicious attempt and no one is really sure if xmlrpc.php is even enabled on the targeted site.

EOSFlare.io is my favourite EOS block explorer which can be of great help here. There are several ways to identify the contract account name for a certain token. EOS Tokens page listed out all the available on the network at the moment. The 12-characters in the bracket is the contract account name that we are looking for. Or you can key in own account name in the explorer shall show all the holding in a very neat manner. Lastly, click on the Symbol name and the site will lead to the specific token page and you will see the account name tied together with the symbol. Add them accordingly in the Greymass wallet and the newly added token will show up immediately with current balance.

Users can always pick up additional packages if they want in future. Miniconda keeps things lean and minimized. Use conda to as package and environment manager and not pip.

After all, I just need a simple one-page web page with the least complexity. I thought Adobe Muse was a great choice Despite the End-Of-Life announcement that Adobe Muse is going to stop and remove from the Adobe product list soon, existing users can still continue to build a website on it. Muse is also the only standalone web page builder I’ve found through some intensive research which makes it my first priority to try as I have some ways to pirate the Adobe Cloud(shameful and I know it). Like any other visual-based web page builder, Muse biggest selling point was build a website without coding at all. The famous Adobe brand gave me confidence that this product would be worthwhile if I invest some solid learning hours on it. I was dead wrong After spending 3 to 4 days of googling, watching tutorials, and experimenting on the product itself. I gave up. While you might be able to crack the Muse, it requires a valid Adobe account connection to use the Adobe Typekit to use the font database which is crucial to the design.Since this is a drag-and-drop site with very limited coding ability, one will mainly depend on the ready-made widgets which is often selling independently on a widget market.Since my ultimate goal is to draft the web page and export HTML code for hosting purpose, people said the Muse generated code was dirty as hell.The software learning curse is steep, especially there is only minimal tutorial and support resource available online.Picking up the software skill’s at such difficulty might not worth it since it is going to be obsolete soon anyway. I wish I could spend the time and effort somewhere else for the simple site building, seriously. Stop looking at the Muse if you are about to explore the world of web development like me.

And Webflow is the best-paid service I could find that meets every one of my requirements: Extremely easy to use interfaceMore customization than dummy website builder like Wix.Relatively way lower learning curve than Muse and its competitors. The best thing about Webflow is probably it is all free to use and host with some limitations of course. That means you study and try out the awesome website building tool for free all you want without paying a penny and even publish it with webflow domain. Since my goal is just to use the builder tool to draft a website and later export it out the code. I can later subscribe to the cheapest monthly plan($16) and export the full code and then cancel it. The team is currently working on a flexible export option on the free plan which I think would come in great handy for a user like myself who just wanted to utilize the tool only. Not to mention that I heard Webflow generates clean codes which is really a bonus point to me. Clean and intuitive UI with tons of features. Export code interface. User can only preview limited codes on free plan. I have to say their tutorial videos is one of the best I’ve been watched in a long while. Short, precise and sometimes accompanied with a humour sense. Love it!

Despite I rarely trading crypto these days, the other main reason is that the Bot rarely provided positive strong indicator usually. Last night before I decided to spend my last hour of the day playing GTA5, Cindicator Bot notified a great indicator for a famous coin, the Basic Attention Token(BAT) as follows: It suggested a quick 11% gain from the price 0.00004629 BTC to 0.00005161 BTC within 10 days. Just, as usual, I take the fun experimenting over such a positive indicator with little money(just a few hundred bucks). Bought in at a little higher entry point(0.0000480-ish) as I did not get notified instantly. Did not hit the target yet but we are close Here is how the BAT do over almost 24 hours since my bought in time. All day high at 0.0000506 BTC and dipped a little bit to 0.00005011 BTC at the time of this writing. Nice and quick 5%+ profit within a day but our target is not hit yet although it was pretty quick.

Impressive over 10%+ gain within such a short amount of time. Made a total profit of about 0.00475272 BTC(30 USD). Not a fat profit but I’m happy enough. The BAT must have up to something but I was just too lazy to check it out as I know the Cindicator would normally identify some market events that are potentially profitable thus make a prediction questions on it. Take a look at the CMC screenshot today, BAT was the only one with big green while praised by its red-coloured peers. Wonderful view for a BAT speculator like me at this moment! Previous experiment with Cindicator tips was a success took I recalled that I made an experiment 3 months ago with the SUB coin and totally forgot about it. I will take this opportunity to provide the very belated update now. Take a look at the original post if you are curious: https://steemit.com/cindicator/@fr3eze/afunlittleexperimenttestcindicatorsignalwith01btc-63w1es31bi It was a success too, fortunately. In short, I successfully gain 11% as SUB/BTC did trade above 0.0000209 BTC within the predicted time frame, following the Cindicator tips, of course. This is not a promotion. To be honest, I’m not trusting whatever Cindicator was feeding me 100% but I guess it would be fun to share how I trade accordingly with an insignificant capital. Undoubtedly, the joy would be doubled if all the indicators were accurate which is, fortunately, the case now. Let’s see what the next interesting indicator I would receive! Cindicator 又建功啦。这次算是第二次了吧，起初的计划就是用 0.1 BTC 来试一试 Cindicator 给的交易信号有多准。 很幸运的，目前都还没有失手（虽然仅有两次）。简而言之，这次就是在两天内实现了 BAT 会涨 10% 的预言。虽然只赚了不痛不痒的 30 刀，也聊胜于无吧！Posted from my blog with SteemPress : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/big-rally-day-for-bat-while-the-others-are-sinking/ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Big rally day for BAT while the others are sinking’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/bigrallydayforbatwhiletheothersaresinking-brzr2hh0hb/"},{"title":"Best Banking system on Steem?","text":"Since the day I invested in some SP 2 years ago when I first join Steem, I’ve been constantly looking for an investment tool that is going to repay my hard-earned SP in a various way.

He started the YY Bank initially for the sake of CN community as we were quite small compared to the others. I first joined with a delegation of 100 SP as the project aims to support my fellow friends in the same circle. It works like some sort of voting bots while giving out daily interest even investors stay inactive on the platform, just like what a bank does. Read more about it here. I’ve been trying out a several investment tools like the above-mentioned voting bots, @xiguang, @steem-ua, just to name a few. I’m not going to do the math here as I did not bother to do a detailed experiment or comparison but YY Bank just clearly won in the battle in term of investment return. Collecting my delegation back and put it all to the YY Bank I still want to hold most of my SP and I usually delegated out 20% of my power which is at the acceptable level. I guess the YY Bank is not limited to the CN community anymore but you can always check with the bank owner @justyy or check out his post footer in every post for more detail.

That was on a one full year of instalment plan with 0% interest which is why I rather cutting down the damage in smaller chunks than to hurt my wallet in one big blow. This very machine is my best company to go through all the on and offline time. Writing content, editing videos, gaming, coding, so on and so on. Life wouldn’t be the same without this PC. I made some pictures with spec listed as a celebration ceremony: Specs for the peripherals. The Razer mouse were dead not long after, replaced with a SteelSeries mouse. Everything else is working fine and going strong. The GTX1080 was the latest member in the party. Hand-picked every part of the components and did not regret a bit since then. Love the case, love the AMD CPU, love the 960 EVO and all. I always wanted to do a full system performance test and that was part of my plan even before complete building this rig. But you know, procrastinate hit me big time and nothing was done after a year of usage. I should find a weekend and clean the case up, tune the component a little bit and do the long-promised performance test.Posted from my blog with SteemPress : https://fr3eze.vornix.blog/my-pc-is-finally-mine-after-one-year/ This page is synchronized from the post: ‘My PC is finally mine after one year’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@fr3eze/mypcisfinallymineafteroneyear-wppj2uic3x/"},{"title":"I could have help John out if it weren't for Steem","text":"In a random evening, a guy named John Is The Best(Chinese name 约翰是最好的) contacted me out of a sudden, let’s call this guy John.

Let’s get back to our little John. John appeared to have some trouble. Without knowing who I’m in the first place, John was asking for my help as he could not withdraw his 0.9 BTC from an exchange due to the region limitation. Oh ya, he is from China(hence the Chinese name) although I doubt so. So our conversation started this way: Hmmm, mooncrypt.info, I immediately googled about it and the 0.9 BTC trick and this Reddit thread was what I found. Okay, I could expect what trick John would have performed to me soon. Logged in the exchange via John’s credentials, there was indeed a 0.9BTC balance in the account thus I proceeded to withdraw it. I was supposed to do John such favour and I can keep 0.1 BTC for myself as a reward, how generous are you, John! I was hit by this popup message, nonetheless, within my expectation. The rest of the conversation was simple and I summarized them as followed: I was kind enough to provide my BTC address for John to send me the 0.01 BTC in order to unfreeze his account.John said he was broke.I said me too.

Me on the performance laptop which I just bought not long ago with the credit-card-based loan, my brother was happily dealing with his iPad. And it is his only bigger device other than a smartphone. How can one survive a life without a fully functioning computer? This is the unanswered question till today. Why I put computer above all the mobile devices? All in all, the most obvious argument that mobile devices still not capable of doing what a proper desktop OS could do. For example: Mobile devices cannot torrenting/seeding which was a huge part of my online activity a few years back. Maybe some geeks might argue this point and I believe through some hard work it is still possible to torrent on a tablet/phone but that’s just too much of a hassle.Mobile devices smaller screen is making them not the best tool for long-hours work. I’m not a fan of switching different poses while typing a blog due to soreness.Desktop computer is the best productivity tool. Period. Bigger screen, tons of tools that specially designed to work better with desktop mode(like my recent favourite web application Webflow), tons of connectivity, tons of fun.

I was enthusiastically devoted to the EOC dice betting game after the first try in BetDice. Despite the first few wins, I’m not going to lie that I have lost all the gains on top of the capitals eventually, just like the 1000 stories the other gamblers would have told you how they ended up sleeping under the bridge. Except, I’m still able to keep my cosy bed after the loss. I then found out the DICE tokens that I accumulated during the gaming time now worth something! Actually, it worths way more than my past gain and lost capital combined! Here is how the DICE tokens work: The smart contract in BetDice gives you 12 DICE tokens for every 1 EOS being bet. Staking up DICE token granted the ability to share the payout pool every hour. For example, the active payout pool for EOS is now 149 EOS and you are going to receive 0.00206 EOS per 10k DICE token staked, every hour. Bam! You have a steady stream of passive income now. Pretty impressive and brilliant business model I would say. Considering the how generous the banker to set up a payout pool from their pocket, Betdice actually did gain more than losing by encouraging users to keep betting. Bet more to get more DICE -&gt; Stake more DICE to gain more passive payout -&gt;. According to Newton’s Law stated that Banker always win. Gamblers are pouring the EOS to Betdice non-stop in the hope of getting more DICE and winning the actual bets, of course. I was getting 90k DICE. Looking at the native exchange system, 1 DICE is now worth 0.0019 EOS. 90,000*0.0019=171. Dang, my loss was way under 50 EOS and those token that I gained along the process which I thought was shitty now worth way more than everything I had bet with the game? Fantastic! Sold half of the DICE away not long ago and this is what I have left. Hoping for a better price now to sell them all away!

And the used to be smooth and crisp rear camera became almost a crap comparing to the latest phone dual/tri/quad camera system. Other than the camera, everything actually still works as fine as day 1. So why not spend the money on something I needed more?

Since most of my productivity will be some light documenting and browser-based work, monstrous spec to make the notebook fly is probably trivial. Also, as it would be only used when I’m away from the main desktop workstation, spending a fortune on a spare machine is not a wise investment. I narrowed down the requirement of the notebook as follows: 8GB RAM(Chrome is consistently consuming over 4GB dammit) 128 SSD is just(HDD on a notebook is embarrassing) Type-C port(Who doesn’t love this sexy port!) 14 inch or smaller(for the sake of weight) 1.5kg or bellow(Please don’t my on-the-road trip a workout) I can also cut off the fancy useless features like: RGB lighting(Oh come on.) CD-Rom(Come on again.) Dedicated GPU(I won’t even playing the Windows card game at all.)

Webflow provided awesome tutorial like the simplegrids to showcase how it allows designers to implements flexbox in their website with ease.

Well, although I mostly get the idea what a flexbox does I still don’t have an idea how to hand code it in a real project but that was never my goal to web design nonetheless.

Instead of picking up the web trio aka HTML, CSS and JS, you chose to spend the effort in Webflow University to master the visual Designer tool.

Next animation should be quicker as I spent a lot of time to grasp the idea of smoothing the effect and familiarize myself with the tool. I found a huge tip in the learning process though. Besides the wonderful Webflow video courses, make use of the template as a live example. Go to the template page, pick the most expensive template you could find because they usually have the best layout and animation(that’s why they are expensive). I take the $79 Atem business website template as an example. The best thing about template preview is, you can preview it as if a real site in a new tab or preview it in Designer. The latter is what we are trying to utilize. Here you are, the well-built template is opened in the Designer tool which you can inspect every element in it. How the section is defined, what class has been used, how the interaction for a button is designed, what font and colour for the typography. Basically, everything. I used one whole day mimicking the animation process of a popup modal from a template on my own project. In another word, I could go beyond one day if it were not for the help of a template.

Material is a design system – backed by open-source code – that helps teams build digital experiences. If you are a fan of modern design, material design should sounds familiar. Meterial.io aims to educate every designer what material design is all about, in a material design style. The very site itself is a textbook design model for inspiration already.

Breakpoint system sums up a great reference of columns amount and gutter size for various screen size. Most measurements align to an 8dp grid applied, which aligns both spacing and the overall layout. Smaller components, such as iconography and typography, can align to a 4dp grid. Use any number that is dividable by 4dp in spacing would be a good idea. Increment is a block with same height and width. To create a consistent sense in overall design, try to use the increment as building blocks to form the size of element like cards, bars, dialog and etc. Again, for the sake of consistency in layout, use a consistent aspect ratio on elements like images, surfaces, and screen size. Density is good to apply in list, tablesm and long forms which allow users to manage more items at the same time. However, focused task like dropdown menu, picker, and alerts and dialogs are not suitable for increased density. ) ) Higher density, wider margins and gutters. Vice versa. Touch targets should be at least 48 x 48 dp, with at least 8dp of space between each target. Lower than 48 dp there will not as user-friendly for the touch target’s accessibility.

Since I’m indulged in Webflow, they have an active exclusive website template page that offers free and premium templates for a wide range. Could serve as a great source of inpiration nonetheless. I ended up in the [Submission Guidelines page] that users should know before submit a template to the marketplace. Obviously the official authority have to filter everything before putting them up for sale in the public. Good practice to keep the marketplace clean and up to the standard. The page also compiled a long list of template checklist that must be met for a successful template submission. And I found that while many of those requirements are Webflow-specific, there are many general, good tips of making a great web design. Sections should have a min-height instead of a height so that it can grow when there’s more content added. This problem is usually found in hero sections.Website should not have any horizontal scrolling.For the sake of responsive behavior, layouts should be fluid and percentage based for the most part.Components (tabs, sliders, etc) should not be nested. Ex: slider inside of a slider.Links and buttons need hover states to show that they are clickable.Elements that aren’t clickable/interactive should not have hover states.Maps should not have scroll to zoom enabledClass names should describe the element. Bad: “column2”, “text1” or “section-6”. Good: “Social Icon” or “Author Title” or “Testimonial Section.”Classes should be Title Case and not abbreviated. Do not use dashes or other traditional css conventions (e.g. camelCase). Class names should follow correct spelling.Interactions should follow Sentence case and be descriptive e.g. use “Slide nav down on scroll” instead of “Show nav”Large background images should be less than 300kb and small assets should be less than 20kb.Only Google fonts can be used - no Typekit or custom fonts. This list sums up pretty well a general good practice on how to make a modern and attractive website. Furthermore, this would helps a lot for a Webflower during the design process.

Established bullish investors might be embarrassed by their predictions now and average bullish joes like us are likely trying to forget all the stupid decision we have made in the bear market, probably wishing for a time machine to that they can go back in time and draw a clear line with the stupid Bitcoin. Suddenly everyone is saying getting rid of Bitcoin is a wiser choice. Just like how everyone was hailing for it last year. Act along or against the mainstream opinion? Your bet.

Occasionally, I did some purchase in Amazon US and ship them over to Singapore. I hooked some really good deals as the same items would cost a lot more on the local market and with the top-notch customer support, I always regard the Amazon one of the must-know hacks for online shoppers. Owning a Kindle a few years ago just made me sticks more to the Amazon ecosystem because it is so comfortable operating within the system. My sweet journey with Amazon has ended due to a silly transaction So back to a few months back Amazon decided to support the SG market and make the Amazon E-commerce site available here although with a way smaller inventory. I found a great deal on GPU that I couldn’t find it cheaper elsewhere. Proceeded to make the payment after checkout. It was successful, expect the transaction bounced after half an hour. Tried a few more time, no luck. To make thing worse, Amazon system suspended my account as it suspected some hackers were trying something funny. While it was actually me myself dealing with the stupid system with my own account. The account remained suspended for a few months I have had enough as I getting active with my Kindle again and would like to buy more books. Contacted the customer support a few times which requires a logged in status to start with, while my issue was exactly with the login(stupid design, again). By all means, I had to use a secondary account to initiate the chat and contact. Anyway, the best answer Amazon could give me was to shut down the account and ask me to create another one if I would like to shop again. So I have to use a new email address to sign up a new account(stupid, again!), my transaction history is gone, and most importantly, my Kindle book collection gone as well. Fortunately, I did not have much invested in the books. This is exactly the downside of a centralised service. Bad day.

Exodus 1 comes with a modern spec that many other phones are sharing, nothing short but nothing outstanding on the paper. While the biggest selling points could be summed up as follows: The only crypto is acceptable for payment. Build-in crypto wallet. Integrated Brave as the default browser. Basically, it is just a smart hardware wallet. A hardware wallet that is able to make calls. While crypto security is the main attraction here, making your hardware wallet a smartphone just degrade the security so much. Simple, when a device offers a dozen ways for decryption other than just the 12-word seeds, it makes the device more vulnerable.

While I love the idea of coding which always looks like a real-life superpower to make anything possible, I often find myself not really a good coder whenever trying to dive deep in it. That is also the biggest reason I found Webflow such an amazing web designing tool. However, the project I’m working on is more than just a static page and that web development skills are necessary for the process. I’ve learned that Javascript frameworks like Angular, React and Vue has been really hot among the web dev circle and the great thing about those frameworks is that they aim to greatly simplify the complex frontend coding process. Decided to go with Vue for its lightweight design and the relatively flat learning curve compared to Angular and React, I’ve found Scrimba a really fun and interesting project to make code learning a fun process. Scrimba is a powerful new way of learning code. Play around with the instructor’s code any time, right in the player. Scrimba is a rather young project which you can find all of the tutorials are web related like HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Javascript frameworks, and so on. Scrimba is making the code learning process to another level in term of user interaction. Basically, all tutorial are playing full screen in the mode of text editor view where you can see the cursor moving around and coding happen real time while the tutor explaining it. Pretty much like watching a Youtube video. But wait, the real magic starts when you paused that video. Users get to edit the code and the built-in browser will show result real time as if you were doing the same thing with a real text editor and test with a real browser. Except with Scrimba, everything is included in a single page. When users have done messing around with the code, resume the video and the tutorial will starts from where it stopped and erases all the user’s changes. Users can pause the tutorial anytime when they feel like playing around with whatever code to understand the concept better. This has made the learning process as fun as it could be. Personally, I think this very fascinating! Hopefully, they would add more tutorials to the Vue as it as relatively younger than the big brother Angular and React. Happy coding!

I own the Dell U2717D for over a year now and all the while I thought it has a great out-of-box setting for the color management so I did not bother much tuning it. Furthermore, I’m not making graphics content or video editing for a living. Until I stumbled upon the idea of exploring the capability of this monitor and research for the recommended setting for it. How? TFT Central is an awesome site focus on testing and reviewing a wide range of monitors on the market. It hosts a database showing the optimal setting for each of the listed monitors and it is a long list. Chances to find yours on the list is pretty high. The best thing is these configuration tweaks were tested via expensive colorimeter like X-rite i1 Pro and LaCie which the average guy will not have the skill to utilize. Most guys just never heard of it, including me.\\ If you are new to screen calibrating, it would be great to read the simple guideline to get the idea of what the site could be of help. Basically, a user just has to configure the monitor on hardware level by pressing the buttons on the body, and secondly down the ICC profiles from the database with respect to the individual model. The whole process would not take more than 10 min and it is free. The result? Noticeably nicer, way nicer. It’s like peeling off the worn-out, blurry screen protector off the phone display and the old phone pretty much feels like new again.

Following will be the impressions of my not very extensive usage. Pros: Looks elegant and sexy. There are many competitors on the 2-in-1 tablet market but Surface Pro series is bar to none when it comes to the aesthetics. Looks great from all angles and this factor alone makes the device very welcoming to use.Lightweight. With a device that thin and light(less than a kilogram), SP6 is the most portable laptop I’ve ever used. My back and arms finally can skip the extra workout session in the daily commute. However, this is definitely not a friendly one-handed device. Hold it like how you hold a phone or tablet will quickly tire the hand.Battery life lasts easily for a day. I’ve never had a problem with the battery life but all I do was just web surfing and lightweight stuff that does not turn the device into beast mode. This has given me a peace of mind when I carry it to work without bringing the charging kits. Once I forgot to charge it and take it to work for casual reading at 40% battery, it stays alive till the very night with “battery saver” mode and I was impressed.Keyboard beyond expectation. Many said the type cover keyboard is one of the best keyboards of laptop. While I still don’t get the pricy price point for the separate keyboard that cost S$200 alone, it actually types well. The key travel travels and feedback are reasonable and comfortable. Also, I did not expect the touchpad offers some really useful gesture controls like Macbook does. Overall, the type cover is a must to have for SP6.Great speakers. While I never get the idea of getting a killer speaker on a portable device like mobile phone or laptop, which could be easily solved by much better external speakers and headphone, SP6 actually has a great pair of front-facing speakers that sounds nice. These are the good impressions so far I’ve got from the Surface Pro 6. And a more interesting cons list is coming up on next post. Stay tuned!

Last Black Friday Sales which was 2 months ago, there were some really nice deals I’ve heard about for VPN subscription. I was too busy to look at those deals at that moment, NordVPN was one one of the better deals back and I heard good things about that brand in the Reddit community. So I proceeded to find out what is the current offer compared to the last BF sales price, this way I can tell how sincere was the BF deal from this brand as well. However, there is no difference. NordVPN What was the Black Friday sales price? At just $2.99 per month, this Black Friday special has you walking away with three years of top-notch internet security for a measly $107.55 total. Talk about an absolute steal. Source What is the current price? Official site $2.99 per month and $107.55 total for a 3-year deal. Absolutely the same. ExpressVPN What was the Black Friday sales price? $6.67/MoSource What is the current price? Official site Exactly the same, shame. Verdict This vpnblackfriday listed all the VPN Black Friday sales and you can simply check out the present price of each brand the chances are the prices will still be the same. In other words, if you wondering what is the best time to hunt for a great deal for your first or next VPN services.

My little project with 3 team members collaboration allows(forces) me to pick this knowledge up or it would be a nightmare for me every time I need to pull or push stuff in and out the remote repository. I won’t try to do all the explanation here but there are a few really useful resources that helped me get started with the Git and I will list them down below. Git client - GitKraken In fact, all the git client are usable no matter what remote repository service you are using from the GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and so on, as long as they are using Git as the backend. GitKraken is one of the most well-known git clients that is reputable in the community. Cross-platform, nice UI, solid features. Personal version is free. Head over to the nicely done tutorial page if the interface is a little overwhelming. Remote Git repository services Overall, GitHub is the winner generally for its reputation and adoption(our dear Utopian recognize open source work on Github only). Easy to use, lots of support from all over the places for the super huge userbase, and the free Github Page which allows the user to host any static page for free is one of the coolest features. However, to make a private repository on Github is not a free service. I go with the Bitbucket. Although it is not as straightforward as Github, it has the better UI and the designed workflow of Bitbucket will naturally push you to learn more about how Git works(and this is really inevitable) which leads us to the next section. Git learning resources As a total beginner, Learn Git with Bitbucket Cloud is a really great start to get the concept of version control using Git. Although it is using Bitbucket as the remote repository the tutorial content can actually apply to any other Git repository services. Together with all the beginner-friendly language and illustration, one should be able to pick up Git quickly. If you wish to cut out all the BS and get straight to the point while a more technical guide is preferable, this Oliver Steele Blog is a perfect choice. Yeah, basically there are cheat sheets for everything and they often come in handy. Pick up some quick reference for the commands from great sheets below: Git Cheat Sheet - GitHub Professional Services- by GitHubGit cheat sheet - by Atlassian Bitbucket Happy coding!

The famous fabric type cover is very comfortable and great for the stylish hipster look, but too bad it is made of fabric. It gets dirty easily when the usual metal material laptop base. I find myself starting to wipe clean the public tables every time before putting my Surface on it. The fear of contaminating the crispy clean type cover was growing to the extent that I feel like I’m serving the device more than it is serving me. And this is totally against my principle.While it has a generally good mouse pad, the clicking is rather not comfortable. The clicking is tough and requires more force to press down to register a click. The clicking sound is loud as well. Lack of Thunderbolt 3 port. I’ve no idea what the Surface Pro team was thinking that they decided to exclude this industry standard in the year 2019. It was such a deal breaker for me and I wouldn’t buy it if weren’t for the huge discount on Black Friday sales. Wake up, Microsoft. Due to the lacking of TB3 ports, Microsoft has to make their independent charger brick. Although it is much smaller and portable than the traditional 1KG charger, user still has to bring the whole charger since the the charging cable is unique and undetachable from the charger brick. One last complaint and this is more a personal thing, I intended to use the Surface Pro as a laptop mainly, which wasted the “table” side of this 2-in-1 tablet device and I think is another form of wasted resource as well. Overall, Surface Pro is still a solid device and a leader in 2-in-1 tablet. Make sure you will make full use of both the laptop and tablet side of this machine and I think that would be a great investment to make for anyone.

I’ve got nothing to do but receiving constant notification that my miner was receiving another payment. Everything is well set up and worry-free. The other reason, of course, was due to the sinking of crypto market the whole 2018. I was distracted by other more profitable things and was too busy to keep an eye on the monitor bot messages.

Doing it wrong or overdo it could spell a big disaster to the overall feeling one application gives to its users. Exiting and closing can have a higher speed than the opening animation. As it requires less user attention than the user’s next task.Relatively, animation of small area should use a shorter duration than those that traverse larger areas. For example, animation for icon has a duration of 100ms while a full screen popup could use 300ms.Animation duration is best around 300ms. Make it shorter for a bolder feel, longer for a more relaxed effect.Determine the orientation to use by considering the motion of an expanding surface. The arc should match the primary scrolling axis of the UI. For example, a card in a vertically scrolling UI will expand using a vertical out arc. When the card collapses, the motion reverses, first moving vertically and then horizontally. The Motion teaches tons of lesson that make sense and was a little bit overwhelming for my current standard to absorb it all.

It helps the transition of visual design tool to hand coding much smoother for me too, especially after being able to export the code and trying to understand how things work behind the scene, and trying to add custom codes. The community is active and helpful, basically any issue you encountered with the tool someone has asked before on the forum and solution was given. So far I don’t have to fire a question myself because everything is on the table. However, the only shortcoming will be the limited functionalities. When I said limited, the comparison was with the hand coding which possibilities are endless hence this is not really a fair argument. While I’m sure the existing functionalities are more than suffice for a basic to intermediate website, custom code support in the paid plan is definitely something nice to have to add features that are not yet available on the platform.

I did not win the contest Half a year later, the result was announced and I wasn’t in luck despite the 9 submissions. To make things better, the HR decided to award a fixed amount of fiat prize to the overwhelming participants, in term of cash vouchers. And I decided to sell those vouchers away and buyback STEEM. Sold the S$280 worth of vouchers for S$263 a few days later, a 6% discount was given because that was the quickest way to get rid of it. Deposited the cash to local exchange and bought 0.0536 BTC and eventually converted it to 749 STEEM. Verdict In short, I turned 200 STEEM to 749 STEEM within half a year. Although you might say if I sold that 200 STEEM, hold the fiat and buyback today I would have gotten the same result. But the fact is if it weren’t for the logo contest I would not spend or cash out the STEEM anyway. Furthermore, a couple of designers has been paid and get their work recognized in the process while this shows me another use case of STEEM is possible and fun. Stay cool and stay Steeming!

While doing so, realizing the ledger is transparent which such a big movement will surely trigger the public’s awareness, the government also stated a ridiculous and pathetic statement via a memo saying that such movement was due to some security concern. Secured from what? Likely not the theft, but the seemingly dangerous proposal of hardfork that is going to nullify the huge stake. Powering down all the SP and moving all the fund to exchange, while telling the community that they are not going to run away with it, sounds exactly like those famous Wall St. investors telling the public to avoid cryptocurrency at all cost, but buying Bitcoin so hard while they still can behind the stage.

After tons and months of researching which VPN is the best (dangerous topic to dive into, a huge amount of time is at stake), I’ve concluded that the Private Internet Access(PIA) could be my best bet considering it has a pretty good reputation among the community and great review from my Singapore peers. Here are some notable features coming from PIA: Probably the cheapest VPN ever at $2.91/month if you go for the two years plan(total $69.95), I’m on this plan if you are wondering.One account can pair up to 5 devices. This is more than enough for covering all the digital devices for an average person.PIA keeps no log on their server so your privacy is well kept even if the service was taken down by FBI.Fast internet speed as this is one of my biggest concerns when it comes to adding proxy server in between my computer and the internet. I have not noticed any slowdown on internet speed since day one using it.It accepts Bitcoins as payment. This might not sound like outstanding as VPN service providers are one of the pioneers to adopt crypto payment. My second Bitcoin payment buying service. There is some minor drawback with PIA as well, such as user cannot choose their own username, 7 days of guaranteed money back period is much shorter than its competitors. But none of those is deal breaker for me. Bottom line It might not feel significant ‘secured’ or ‘upgraded’ the moment you put the VPN on your house internet connection. The extra peace of mind moments come when I connect my MacBook to the Starbucks public WiFi and I can rest assured no one is sniffing my connection, and the moment I realise I can visit some websites(no porno)that was previously blocked by my company network. It feels extra awesome especially this privilege comes from the cost of merely one cup of coffee, in a month. If you are interested, this is a referral link which can get us both a bonus 30 days.

And I have a secondary computer(Macbook), so I think this Logitech MX Anywhere 2S could be a real solution for my case. The best part about this mouse: Wireless and very portable due to its small size, I like a small mouse.It is rechargeable and ultra lasting, one full charge claims to last about 3 months. Have no comment on that yet as I was just using it for the second week.It can be paired up to 3 devices. So my main desktop PC and MacBook can share the same mice seamlessly. Tested and it works like a charm. Super fast on pairing and almost no delay in the process. The gimmick part about this mouse: The Flow feature is somewhat not necessary in real life. It sounds cool to use the same mouse across 2 different system without even switching the pairing. But I guess most of the people just won’t utilize this feature.The hyper scrolling feature. Not as useless as the Flow but I find it rather replaceable by the keyboard navigation key in the long document where a fast scrolling up and down is needed. The bad part about this mouse: The middle click is not working! Most annoying surprise when I found this out. The scroll button is not clickable and there is no way to use it as the average mouse like open a link in the new tab in a browser or so. I did a workaround by setting the side press of scroll button to mimic the middle click function. By far I’m very satisfied with this mouse and it quite lives up to its fame except for the middle click part. I heard the MX Master series retain the middle click function but it is like 50% more expensive, also I’m afraid the bigger size of it will be another problem for me to get comfortable. If you are still doing productivity stuff on a gaming mouse, you are doing it wrong. Give the Logitech MX series a try!

I wasn’t in the team but as a senior administrator from the same company I advise them to use the smarter way to do it, which is copy the configuration file over and modify some variables, which is much quicker and more admin way of doing things. Young lads agreed that was a good idea and proceed to try this way out. While they are trying the old lady came back to the room and found this out. Out of nothing at all she started to get upset, claiming that they weren’t respect her. She started to throw out unreasonable word like “If you are not listening to me, I will just go home.” “Do whatever I told you to do.” While obviously our workaround works much better with high efficiency.

But the following do-before-you-ask list is rather accurate and pretty much spells that, probably you shouldn’t ask that question at all. Before asking a technical question by e-mail, or in a newsgroup, or on a website chat board, do the following: 1. Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to. 2. Try to find an answer by searching the Web. 3. Try to find an answer by reading the manual. 4. Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ. 5. Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation. 6. Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend. 7. If you&apos;re a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code. I doubt there would be still a need to ask the question after performing all mentioned 7 steps.

It doesn’t hold some features back for a payware version. Its source code is available for anyone to review. We don’t track our users, and our website and forums have no third-party ads or analytics. Cleanest in both the UI and functioniality. It literally does one job and does it great – torrenting.

It obviously not worth the effort switching my PC to WiFi and furthermore, it is only LAN enabled.

I regard the mobile gaming is one of the worst habits to waste time, but the good thing about EOS knight is that I actually don’t have to spend a lot of time on it due to its idle gaming mechanism. To me, the motivation of playing this game is puremaking some EOS so the marketplace for materials and equipment is my main focus. The game recently introduced a new update Hitting over 700 floors now will allow players to sell 4 items at the same times which is 1 item more than the previous limit. Definitely sounds interesting for a heavy trader like myself. I’ve been staying at 500+ floors for quite a while and kind of making back all my initial EOS. It is the right time to go for a higher floor, at least beyond the 700 ceiling. I’m ready to splash those EOS again! Made my most powerful equipment The only way to achieve that is upgrade equipment of knight so they can either deal more damage or staying alive longer. Long story short, I made a new armourMare Tranquilitatis which happens to be the most powerful item in my collection. The item is 90% done and here is the plan that is going to be completed anyhow: Make 16 same items and synthesise them all together into one for max levelling it to Level 5. And the breakdown of cost is: About 1 EOS / Item About 3 EOS for the cost of Magic water which acts like the fee for such operation (1 * 16) + 3 = 19 EOS At the time of writing, 1 EOS = $5.59 which make the item cost about $106.21. Oh my Fxxking God. This alone will tops all my game spending record combined! It is my most expensive spending in a damn game so far To be honest, I’m not even mad. I was fascinated by this fact and I did not realize the actual cost while I was busy crafting the item. It works like charm though and does what it does to bring my game to another level. And in fact I could just sell it away at the same cost price at least(it is a damn fine item anyway). While I do not regret crafting expensive item as such, this is a whopping price to pay though. The lesson of this post is, gaming using crypto could be dangerous as betting in the casino with chip. Players often ignore the actual value of the token. We often treat one chip as one unit despite the actual value it carries no matter it worth $5 or $100 a piece. And that explains very well in my case as I calculated the value in term of EOS instead of converting them to the daily updated price at CMC before making a decision. Which would anyhow make the game a lot more troublesome to play with right? While this powerful and sexy amour starts to show, I hope the value would retain more or less the same in the market by the time I decided to let it go. Else it would be a huge loss, ouch!
