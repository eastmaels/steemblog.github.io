<p>This is Salmon. There are lots of discussions going on about voting bot again kr community in Korea. Personally, I did not have any opinion about voting bot, however recently I made up my mind that voting bot should be actively used. First of all, I will give you two links below which is recent opinion that started coming up. Please see this people&#x2019;s perspective and opinion carefully since we can learn a lot from it.(Unfortunately, it is in Korean, but if you use google translator I am sure you can understand) </p>

<p>Two people are concerned about the negative effect that will be caused by service provided from voting bot such as @randowhale based on evidence and perspective. So you can simply take those opinions as recommending steemit and hoping people do not use voting bot service &#x2018;if possible&#x2019;. The reason why I used phrase &#x2018;if possible&#x2019; is because fundamentally steemit represents side ignorant of this issues unless if you are recommending voting bot or if there is any big problem, Steemit is very unique SNS world with voting bot hanging around.</p>
<p>Recently, I came up with 2 ideas while &#x2018;actively&#x2019; using voting bot. For the ideas, I will tell you from the writing below. But before that I will talk about my perspective on voting for your understanding.</p>
<p>May I l start with stories about @randowhale?</p>
<hr>
<p>One day in 1980, a boy was born in one of hospital in Pyeongtaek Korea. Unfortunately, the boy was not healthy and suffered from severe polio due to virus infecting nervous system. Weak boy was abandoned by his parents and was adopted to one of household in USA through Holt Children&#x2019;s Services Inc. Only little information was transferred to parents through children&#x2019;s Services. Name is Park, Ran Do (&#xBC15;&#xB780;&#xB3C4;, &#x6734;&#x862D;&#x9053;) estimated to be born in Pyeongtaek, 3 years old, and shows paralysis in lower body. </p>
<p>Step parents raised the kid with love. Boy was given name David. Step parents encouraged the child so he does not lose his dream and courage because of his physical disability. Boy was smart and grew up with dream to become programmer who overcame his defect. If he became programmer, he could use his hand to work and move around the world through internet.</p>
<p>But there was tragic accident. David&#x2019;s step parents who were his big supporter suddenly passed away due to traffic accident. By then, David was only 16 years old. David was so shocked and started suffering from severe depression. He could not get any reason or answer to live and how to live. He crouched himself in his room all day. He was isolated from the outside world. People from local welfare center came sometimes for help but that could not stop David disappearing from the world. Actually, it is more accurate to say that David has forgotten about the world. </p>
<p>Time passed but nothing changed. He only extended his life with soulless meals. Only things he had done was surfing the internet. World that does not welcome me&#x2026; The world different from where I live&#x2026; I was spending meaningless time just to get out of boredom. He came to know Facebook. But David did not know anyone. He made bitter smile on his face seeing user becoming friends with each other. World is connected through Facebook.. David once more felt left out. </p>
<p>One day, by coincidence he happens to know steemit. Beta version&#x2026; It was not even at the beginning. Some minions were talking things about Blockchain and opening of new world. &#x2018;Blockchain&#x201D;..? Since I don&#x2019;t have anything to do should I just find out about it? Oh,, I always do not have anything to do.</p>
<p>David tried to find out about Blockchain. It was so innovative. David who was far away from the society started to get attracted to Blockchain which contains minor and rebellious spirit. Although he lived isolated from the society, he felt that society was unfair and many things were decided by only few who have power. There is no chance that such society will change. But shouldn&#x2019;t we try to balance the power? Even though Blockchain was merely one of the fields in technology, it seems like message. His eye was lit up and he reconnected himself to steemit. So this system is based on Blockchain? One of the posting started to get into his sight. </p>
<p>David stayed overnight without eating anything for 3 days. At first, he tried to find identity of steemit, but instead get to know how the world is going on. Besides, every single activity was recorded and revealed through steemit. This is it..! If the world is going on like this, David thought that there must be some space somewhere that he could squeeze himself in. Finally, it was time for David to face the world again. </p>
<p>He wanted to make an account. He had to make name first. Should it contain name David? No.. David wanted to born again in the new world. Nobody can know, but my own secret&#x2026; maybe name that even my real parents who are utter stranger won&#x2019;t be able to know.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Rando&#x2019;</p>
<p>He could not the know meaning of his name and did not even try to know. One time he saw strange looking car passing the town through the window. </p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JzTxKwW.jpg" alt="">
[Captured from Naver.com]</p>
<p>&#x201C;Daddy, what kind of car is that?&#x201D;
&#x201C;Hmm&#x2026; I asked and found out that it is called &#x2018; Korando&#x2019;.&#x201D;
&#x201C;Korando? What kind of name is that?&#x201D;
&#x201C;Korea Can Do-Korando.. Maybe it is car from Korea.&#x201D;
&#x201C;You meant that car is from Korea?&#x201D;
&#x201C;Hmm,, place called Pyeongtaek is where factory is located. Could it be your home town maybe?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Korando.. I do not know about Korean but I was so happy that it has my name Rando in it. One day if I will be able to drive, I will drive that car. </p>
<p>All of sudden, David think about the name Rando that he recalled while looking at Korando. Probably, it is the name that only he could remember. There is no other name that is better than that. But? What the fuck&#x2026; some guy has already made account using @rando. It must be the Korean guy who has same name as me. He had to add extra letters to Rando. What should be good? Salmon that freely swims in the deep ocean? No. Whale should be better. Alright, in this ocean called steemit, I will live as whale. Since I was born, I never walked before but now I will be able to swim big ocean!</p>

(Captured from @randowhale)</p>
<h2 id="randowhale&#x2026;"><a href="#randowhale&#x2026;" class="headerlink" title="@randowhale&#x2026;"></a>@randowhale&#x2026;</h2><p>Finally, ID was made. He withdrew all the compensation that he got from his step parents traffic accidents and charged steem power. Now he was ready to start. However, there was another problem. SNS was bondless sea to David who avoided any communication with the world. He did not know where to start and what to start. It was a new task for him. </p>
<p>Actually, there were no common topics that David could communicate with the others. It was because he could not hang around due to his physical disability and introverted characteristic, For him, travel diary of @sweetsssj, food trip by kr Muk-steem user( User of kr steemit who travels around for delicious food) was different world to him. His emotion was dried up so he could not write any story like @jack8831. Of course, since it is in Korean&#x2026; Let&#x2019;s Pass</p>
<p>So only thing that David could do was programming. Programming was David&#x2019;s only joy. Logical composition and group of terms that do not allow any exception&#x2026; Programming ensured fair world with definite result. It was not like that his discomfort with his leg that are coded well will go wrong or person with healthy body and charming characteristic can make wrong coding into work. The world that will be seen as it is made is the fair world David always hoped for. </p>
<p>David or randowale started to get connected with steemit world through programming. But he wanted to be anonymous. Most all, he wanted to play within the fair rules. He read whitepaper and learned rules. To overcome his complex with his legs, he wanted to travel around the ocean. Finding myself while not restricted to certain community or topic, I wanted to go wherever I need to be. But I cannot always find everything by myself. Instead then I will have to make others find me. If someone call myself and request what I can give, then I wanted to help accomplish it. What could it be? </p>
<p>Randowale started to make voting bot. If someone needs me that means they want voting. Then I will provide voting for them. Is there such thing as good or bad information? Probably there could be. But as a person who lived different from the others, information in the world should be divided as good, useful but not bad, and useless. If someone calls me up then that is because my information is pretty useful. I don&#x2019;t need to judge. Decision should be made by people who call me. </p>
<p>Making bot does not violate rules of steemit community provided from whitepaper. I have the right to voting within my steem power. I am just using those right appropriately and I can even ask for compensation. If I can vote $10 then it is absolutely okay to ask for $10. But I will suggest lower commission fee for my $10 voting. This is a discount. Besides, if I created $10 voting with lower commission fee, then this means that I have created added value. </p>
<p>But&#x2026; there could be users who want to use my service. Among those users, I don&#x2019;t want users with many steem powers and high reputation to use. If possible it will be much better if many people can use it freely. Anyway my capability to voting has its limit and if it is only $1~$2, it won&#x2019;t be hard to use it. </p>
<p>My @randowhale will reply right way once someone calls me. I will leave record to show people how much voting I have used and whose request I have replied in order to share fair record. Also for my other users, I will add up link to show my goals and content of services. I will no more hate the world that I used to. If user from all over the world calls me up then I can swim ocean of whole wide world. By powering up using steem dollar given by users, I will be able to grow. Don&#x2019;t you think someday I will be able to become real whale? </p>
<p>Now, let&#x2019;s go out to the ocean&#x2026; </p>
<hr>
<p>Whew, this is the story of @randowhale that I know. Believe it or not&#x2026;actually it is a fiction that I made it up. </p>
<p>I think that most user do not have good perspective on voting bot. So do I. But before we start talking about voting bot, I wanted to get rid of stereotype</p>
<p>What kind of people will make voting bot like @randowhale? For sure, we cannot know since they are anonymous. But including me don&#x2019;t we think about the same things?</p>
<p>&#x2022; Cunning
&#x2022; Young man
&#x2022; Good at programming
&#x2022; Smart, intelligent (Cunning ) 
&#x2022; Target weakness of steemit system
&#x2022; Attract investor actively after seeing result of progress is decent 
&#x2022; Investor who is like moneylender seeking for money 
&#x2022; Who tries to get money as much as he can until similar service comes out
&#x2022; Or make similar service personally and pretend it is in competition </p>
<p>Don&#x2019;t you think about the same thing? First, I wanted to talk about the use and its meaning of voting bot without any stereotype. From now on I will right some essays about these issues. Thank you. </p>
