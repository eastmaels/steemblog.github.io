<p>I&#x2019;ve shared that my Uncle died just a few days ago.  It was a mix of hard living and poor dietary choices that led to several strokes, and ultimately a heart attack.  He was in his late 70s or early 80s.  I should know, but I don&#x2019;t keep those dates in my head all that well.  He lived the life he wanted to live for the time period he wanted to live it and then had a relatively short and sharp drop decline to the end of his life.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m a little sheepish about this tradition I&#x2019;ve set.  It&#x2019;s filled with privilege for one because it&#x2019;s expensive, but it also strikes me as being weird.  Really&#x2026; I mean, who fucking goes sky diving to take an emotional load off.  Anyway, it strikes me as weird&#x2026; that said I want to share it anyway.  So, I&#x2019;m hard on myself for this anyway, but also feeling a touch defensive about it.</p>
<h2 id="My-aunt"><a href="#My-aunt" class="headerlink" title="My aunt  "></a>My aunt  </h2><h2></h2><p>I heard about my uncle&#x2019;s passing.  I think I was in shock for a few days.  I spoke to him a few days before he died.  He started hospice and I knew this was coming (even though I thought it woudl be months away) so I don&#x2019;t feel like a terrible nephew, but it&#x2019;s hard to see that side of my family die especially after my mom&#x2019;s death.  I didn&#x2019;t communicate as frequently as I should have cause it triggers me and makes me relive her dying of cancer.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I called my aunt and didn&#x2019;t reach her, and she called me back right before my lesson / flight time.  It&#x2019;s like the universe was precisely facilitating my ritual.  She kinda walked me through how he died and for the first time since I heard he died I could get some tears out.</p>
<h2 id="Flying"><a href="#Flying" class="headerlink" title="Flying "></a>Flying </h2><h2></h2><p>I then went in and did five 2 minute sessions.  2 minutes sounds short, but the closest thing I can think of is when i wrestled in high school and the periods were 2 exhausting minutes.  I&#x2019;m like 240 pounds.  It takes some physical work even with the wind doing most of the work to hold me up.  So, it&#x2019;s a little bit mentally challenging to balance and feel ones body and navigate the wind.  It was emotionally relieving.  I like feeling like I&#x2019;m floating and I like breathing the wind shooting into my lungs at 100+ mph.  The phrase take a breath of fresh air is amplified at those speeds!</p>
<h2 id="Defenses-down"><a href="#Defenses-down" class="headerlink" title="Defenses down "></a>Defenses down </h2><h2></h2><p>When the whole thing was over and I was in my car I finally could let some go.  When I was in graduate school I had the hardest time of my life.  I was literally working around 100 hours a week.  I would take every other Sunday afternoon off and otherwise I was working from around 9am in the morning to 11pm at night.  I did that for 8 months so I could graduate and get to the job that was waiting for me.  I worked at that clip and it was literally killing me.  I would get in there and dealt with a million stresses.  My wife would tell me to get her the fuck out of Texas, work would tell me to hurry up as the job wouldn&#x2019;t be there forever, and my boss would tell me I&#x2019;d never make it on time.  The stress was gruesome.  I used to leave my fume hood (I&#x2019;m a chemist), walk into the adjacent lab that was vacant, cry for a good 5-10 minutes, and then go back at it.  I didn&#x2019;t have enough time to waste more than that.  Toss in a friend&#x2019;s suicide and coping through heavy drinking and I was in a bad way.  </p>
<h2 id="Processing"><a href="#Processing" class="headerlink" title="Processing "></a>Processing </h2><h2></h2><p>Anyway, the point of that is that because of time constraints it changed the way I cry to intense 5-10 minute bouts and then life goes on.  I was in my truck right after flying and the wave hit.  My uncle lived near Austin.  So, when I went to grad school down in Texas he lent me a car, let me stay at his house, my wife and I would visit.  He was a fan a supporter.  I don&#x2019;t want to share too much because I want to write an obit for him, but this week has been a real struggle for me.  I&#x2019;m down to just 2 people living in the generation above mine, and while I wasn&#x2019;t super close to my Uncle I certainly felt loved and grateful for the time I spent with him.  He could be a little stoic and hard to know.  That&#x2019;s my mother&#x2019;s side of the family for sure, but even through stoic I felt a lot of love, which I&#x2019;ll truly miss going forward.</p>
<h2 id="Vulnerable"><a href="#Vulnerable" class="headerlink" title="Vulnerable "></a>Vulnerable </h2><h2></h2><p>So, here I am sorta at my worst just trying to let the wind take a load off.  I try to be a strong, balanced and neutral leader as much as I can be for as long as I can be.  That often means keeping parts of me at arms length from this place, from people I care about, from members of PALnet, and my digital homestead.  That said I love this place and I love being a part of this community and wanted to share a touch of weakness and vulnerability.  I&#x2019;m not always the image of the guy I put out there.  Sometimes I&#x2019;m just a sad nephew dearly missing a beloved and supporting uncle.  It&#x2019;s just being.  It&#x2019;s just me.  I thought I&#x2019;d share what that&#x2019;s like at the tough times.</p>
<p>Steem is the broken hearts club.  Here&#x2019;s another piece of my heart ripped off.  I&#x2019;m betting folks can relate, and I&#x2019;m hoping this can positively impact at least one other person to hear this story and see the approach even if it is a little off the wall and in the air.  Much love Steem.  I&#x2019;ve gotten some very supportive comments and kindness.  It matters and thanks for your caring.  Please keep my family in your prayers for a bit.</p>
<p>Namaste,</p>
