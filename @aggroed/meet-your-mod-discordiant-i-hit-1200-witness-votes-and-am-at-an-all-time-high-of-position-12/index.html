<p>So, first just want to give a quick shout out to my witness supporters.  Today I hit 1200 Witness votes.  4 months ago I was barely noticed on the platform.  Today I&#x2019;m a top 20 Witness.  If you&#x2019;re a minnow around here wondering if it&#x2019;s possible I feel like pretty good proof that it is.  @slowwalker is the lastest whale to support my campaign and I&#x2019;m very grateful.  It&#x2019;s been basicly a non-stop ride of work and effort since I started the Minnow Support Project a little under three months ago, but it&#x2019;s been insanely rewarding!  I have a ton of people I legit love and respect.  Friends on every continent.  A radioshow, a streaming radio station, an army of community and curation bots, and a a few dozen people that I&#x2019;ve delegated some steem too.  So far it&#x2019;s been a great ride and I&#x2019;m incredibly grateful and continuing to put in many hours each week.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;re also about to get on the Steemit welcome page.  it&#x2019;s a big deal!!!  With signups fixed we&#x2019;re gonna really get a lot of new users, and if they all visit in MSP this place is gonna get YUUGEE.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&#x2019;s not surprising that my 1200 witness votes and my meet your mod post are linked.  The votes follow the work I do for the platform every day.  One of those jobs is spotlighting the moderators that help make MSP an awesome community.  So, I&#x2019;d like to showcase one now!</p>

<p>Funny story.  @discordiant decided one day to prune the list of inactives from the Minnow Support roster.  So, we lost 880 accounts in one day.  I was cranky about it because I literally posted like 2 days prior that we hit 5,000 accounts.  Anyway, once it happened I asked him to do it every week and also write a report of banned, kicked, and muted members for transparency and make a route back in.  He has a post now where he&#x2019;s basically the police blotter for us sharing which asshat is attempting to scam our accounts and how many post-pormoters we&#x2019;ve banned for spamming lion pics in 40 unrelated channels.</p>
