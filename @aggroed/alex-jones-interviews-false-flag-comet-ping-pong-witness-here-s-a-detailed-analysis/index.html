                Alex Jones Interviews false flag comet ping pong witness-  Here&#39;s a detailed analysis
            
        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <br><p>This comes from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kurt.haskell/posts/10154015593205868" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public facebook page of Kurt Haskel</a>. &#xA0;Kurt is an attorney from the US that now resides in Costa Rica and spends his time outting all the bullshit the current leaders in office like to do non-stop.</p><br><p><br></p><br><p>&#xA0;This is one of the most fake interviews I&#x2019;ve ever seen. This is also a perfect example of why many people don&#x2019;t like or trust Alex Jones.As you know, a few days ago we had the Comet Ping Pong gunman false flag. Here is a quick recap: An actor from North Carolina drove to Washington DC to investigate the Pizzagate allegations tied to Comet Ping Pong. He walked in with an AR15 in the open, maybe fired one shot at a lock on a door, the police were called and he was arrested in minutes without incident. The police report indicated only one worker and 3 customers fled the building. If you think about it, it&#x2019;s utter bs.&#xA0;</p><br><p><br></p><br><p>A real attack would have included a plan such as taking the owner, James Alefantis hostage at closing time, breaking into Comet Ping Pong after it closed to search the entire place, etc. It also would have included a plan to escape and/or a plan to fight to the death with police. Further, it would have for sure included a perpetrator that was undercover with a hidden weapon to lower the risk of the police being called. It included none of these and the perpetrator is, literally, an actor. This is 100% a false flag to paint the Pizzagate online investigators as crazies and to make Pizzagate seem less plausible.</p><br><p><br></p><br><p>Which leads to this interview.In this video, Alex Jones talks to an eyewitness from the Comet Ping Pong gunman false flag. Here is what raised red flags with me. First of all, the eyewitness comes right out attacking Alex Jones. There was no &#x201C;thanks for having me on&#x201D; or an introduction of who this guy is or what he saw. This guy went straight into blaming Alex Jones for his role in the &#x201C;attack&#x201D; on Comet Ping Pong. He blames Alex Jones for inciting attacks on Comet Ping Pong by his discussions on prior shows regarding Pizzagate. That is not the normal order to do things in an interview. This was done out of order TO EMPHASIZE THE REAL REASON THIS GUY CAME ON INFOWARS! The real reason he came on Infowars was a concealed threat to Alex Jones.</p><br><p><br></p><br><p>&#xA0;Let me explain.The interviewee is a Washington DC attorney. Don&#x2019;t overlook this point. Do you think think that he would risk thousands or millions in possible lost business by defending possible pedophiles at Comet Ping Pong without being compensated for it? No way. People hate pedophiles and this interview can and should be seen as this attorney DEFENDING THEM. I for one, would never hire this attorney after seeing him stand up for Comet Ping Pong. Attorneys are not dumb. They would never associate themselves with bad publicity and possible lost business &#x2026;&#x2026;..unless they were being paid.&#xA0;</p><br><p><br></p><br><p>It is obvious to me that this attorney is being paid by somebody involved in Pizzagate or Comet Ping Pong or both. He is not an eyewitness and how could he be anyway when it was a fake event?Now let&#x2019;s look at his story. He took his family, including two kids to Comet Ping Pong after hearing the story about Pizzagate on NPR. Sure he did. Maybe Child Protective Services should look into this. Any reasonable parent would stay far away from this place. This guy saw the &#x201C;gunman&#x201D; out of the corner of his eye as he walked by and he was concealing a weapon. Uh, no. If you saw him concealing a weapon you would immediately put your full sight onto him. He doesn&#x2019;t mention turning or getting a better view. If it was out of the corner of his eye, he wouldn&#x2019;t have likely seen a weapon or someone trying to conceal one.&#xA0;</p><br><p><br></p><br><p>By the way, how do you conceal an AR15? This guy gives no account on how his family evacuated the restaurant. He gives no account on any fear his family had. He doesn&#x2019;t talk about how his family is coping at home after having been involved in this stressful of a situation. If this story was true, all of this would be a big part of the story. Obviously, this story is a lie. As I mentioned above, the police report indicates 3 customers left the restaurant. His family consisted of 4 people. His story is impossible.</p><br><p><br></p><br><p>Next, this interviewee goes on an inexplicable rant about how the workers of Comet Ping Pong are hard workers, they aren&#x2019;t pedophiles, that Comet Ping Pong is a normal family restaurant, etc. He even makes these claims despite admitting that he didn&#x2019;t get a look into the backroom. How does he know if there is criminal activity going on in the backroom or not? He doesn&#x2019;t! One thing I know about attorneys, is that they like to make claims BASED ON EVIDENCE! This guy doesn&#x2019;t know anything about Comet Ping Pong because, by his own admission, he had never been there previously, How stupid would this attorney look to future clients if it later came out that every employee of Comet Ping Pong was a Satan worshiping pedophile and there is a video of him on the internet saying the place is harmless? That is why attorneys make claims based on evidence and often use qualifying language to boot, such as, in my opinion, it appears that, etc. This guy does none of that. What I see here is an attorney ADVOCATING FOR HIS CLIENT!&#xA0;</p><br><p><br></p><br><p>This is an attorney working and doing a job he was paid to do. He is attempting to make his client (Comet Ping Pong or elites involved in Pizzagate) appear in the most favorable light as possible. I&#x2019;ve seen this a million times because it&#x2019;s what I did for a living for 15 years. It&#x2019;s very obvious.As far as Alex Jones is concerned his demeanor regarding Pizzagate has definitely changed. I saw a couple videos of his before the election where he discussed Pizzagate and he was crying. Now he says that there are more important things to look into. To change your stance this much did not occur by just a change of opinion. No, Alex Jones was threatened and it wasn&#x2019;t by the incoming Trump administration.Here is what is going on with this &#x201C;interview&#x201D; in my opinion (Note the qualifying language, lol).&#xA0;</p><br><p><br></p><br><p>Alex Jones had to pay his ex-wife, and I believe is still paying his ex-wife a large amount of money. He doesn&#x2019;t want to lose anymore in a defamation lawsuit. Defamation cases regarding damaging accusations like pedophilia are easy to win. Alex Jones knows that the Comet Ping Pong gunman was a false flag. He also knows that the next Comet Ping Pong false flag could/would/will involve deaths that will be blamed in part, on him due to his &#x201C;fake news&#x201D; coverage of Pizzagate. The damages for a fake false flag death, blamed on Alex Jones as a defendant, would be in the millions of dollars (See Charleston church false flag, Sandy Hook, Orlando Pulse shooting, etc.).&#xA0;</p><br><p><br></p><br><p>It is likely that this attorney contacted Alex Jones on behalf of Comet Ping Pong with a threat to cease and desist talking about Pizzagate and Comet Ping Pong or the next step would be a defamation case against him and Infowars for pushing &#x201C;fake news&#x201D; that is damaging to Comet Ping Pong. As part of an agreement to get this attorney to back off, Alex Jones allowed him to come on Infowars as a fake &#x201C;eyewitness&#x201D; and not an attorney for Comet Ping Pong to seem more credible and to get the millions of Infowars listeners to back off their attacks on Comet Ping Pong. I don&#x2019;t think Alex Jones is committing a fraud here, other than saying this attorney is an eyewitness and not a Comet Ping Pong retained attorney. Alex Jones is covering his ass and more importantly, his wallet, and is trying to talk out of both sides of his mouth regarding a serious topic that he knows is all too real.</p><br><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrf7qYRdKRw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrf7qYRdKRw</a>&#xA0;</p><br>
