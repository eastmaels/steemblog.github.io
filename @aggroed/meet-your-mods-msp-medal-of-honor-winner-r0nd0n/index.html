        <span>@r0nd0n: I would have joined right away, but registering on discord was my biggest hurdle. Not that registering there is hard, in fact it&#x2019;s very easy, but I&#x2019;m hesitant to make yet another account somewhere unless I&#x2019;m sure I need it. First, I heard there was a voting bot, which was intriguing, but then I found out about a channel for getting posts critiqued by your peers, and that was incentive enough to finally bite the bullet and get a discord username.</span>

        <span>@r0nd0n: In general, the best aspect is definitely the community. The engagement you get on the PALnet discord adds a whole new layer of depth to the people you interact with on steemit, and I find myself constantly making connections with people I&#x2019;d probably otherwise overlook. MSP has rapidly fostered a plethora of burgeoning communities, services, and niches that constantly impresses me on a daily basis. In essence, joining MSP is like having cheatcodes turned on for steemit.</span>

        <span>@r0nd0n: I look at it as being a vessel for guiding and helping steemians receive the benefits of the largest steemit discord community. I get to do my part to make sure the vision of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty continues for future members to enjoy, and it&#x2019;s worth every second put in.</span>

        <span>@r0nd0n: I&#x2019;ve helped minnows present their content to their followers in (hashtag)msp-workshop ever since I joined MSP, I started a service called @freezepeach which neutralizes flags on controversial subjects to encourage discourse and diversity of opinion on steemit, and most recently I&#x2019;ve stepped up to help manage the fascilitation of MSP&#x2019;s very own 24/7 radio station: @msp-waves. I also hope to contribute some beginner and intermediate tech guides for the new MSP Library.</span>

        <span class="has-mr-6">11</span>
        <span>@r0nd0n: Considering that most users don&#x2019;t vote for witnesses, (7.5% voting is the figure I saw), I think we have a unique oppurtunity to educate the minnows in our pond about the importance of witness voting. However, the implimentation of such a measure could be tricky, but I think it&#x2019;s a worthwhile goal to consider moving forward.</span>

        <span>@r0nd0n: Be the change you want to see; if something is missing or not done right, make it happen yourself. Also, make meaningful connections with the people behind the steemit accounts which interest you. And finally, don&#x2019;t do it for the money, do it to enrich others. Keep selflessly sharing that bit of wisdom which could only come from your unique perspective, and the rewards will be much more than what comes from upvotes on a post.</span>
