<p>I&#x2019;m sad to say this post will end with more questions than with answers.  You may not have noticed, but about 3 months ago Steemit got a new whale.  In terms of whaleballz there&#x2019;s only 1 account that beats it; @steemit.  Literally 3% of all the steem that exists today is in this account.  This is the biggest whale in the ocean, and we know so little about them.  There isn&#x2019;t one post or even anything in the account headings.</p>
<h2 id="the-central-challenge-for-my-search"><a href="#the-central-challenge-for-my-search" class="headerlink" title="the central challenge for my search "></a>the central challenge for my search </h2><h2></h2><p>It matters to me as a witness because the account is witness voting.  This one account without a single post is practically hand picking the top witnesses.  @freedom proxies it&#x2019;s vote to @pumpkin, another account where it&#x2019;s unclear who it is.  For some of the witnesses it amounts to over 30% of the power behind them.  I&#x2019;ve asked no less than 20 whales on here and not one of them has said &#x201C;I know who it is.&#x201D;  The two most common responses are &#x201C;It&#x2019;s Dan&#x201D; and &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know, but I know it&#x2019;s not Dan.&#x201D;  Whales appear to be fairly certain that @pumpkin is Dan (possibly actually Dan&#x2019;s wife).  I&#x2019;ve had it suggested to me by people that I sthink would know.</p>
<p>Presumably I could pay for a Doxx or some shit like that, but I respect privacy that isn&#x2019;t built on the block.  So, let&#x2019;s just see what we can figure out, and maybe that will share with us some clues as to who it might be, but to be clear I&#x2019;m only offering questions and publicly available info on the block.</p>
<h2 id="digging-in"><a href="#digging-in" class="headerlink" title="digging in "></a>digging in </h2><h2></h2><p>Let&#x2019;s start with what&#x2019;s publicly available on the block.  We&#x2019;ll start at steemd.com/@freedom.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmZdmUzg6Xp817oWddaqoqx9DX7NYteQzqDkFuVL4sdoqr/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>@freedom is account 499.  So, one of the things we know is that this person was one of the first members around.  It&#x2019;s entirely possible that they are or were a Steemit Inc employee, but nothing shows me that they have to be.  They are however likely friends with the founders and first devs at the very least.  Not only are they rich which makes a founder want to say hi, but being the 500th person on a platform still has that &#x201C;friends and family&#x201D; appeal.  It&#x2019;s also worth noting that @steem was made on 3/24/16.  This account was made on 3/31/16.  So, within the first week that this place existed.  Hard to suggest anything other than they at least knew the founders.  So, probably a bitshares hound.</p>
<p>Ok, well, my first thought was let&#x2019;s go check the wallet.  There are probably some yuuuuuuuge transactions there.  Turns out there isn&#x2019;t shit.  Not a single transfer going in that could account for any of the size of this account.  So, that got me thinking&#x2026; how tf can you get 7Million steem into an account without a transfer.  These days you can&#x2019;t.  So, I was trying to figure that out.  I moved from steemit.com/@freedom/transfers to checking out what I could find on steemdb.com.</p>
<h2 id="Epic-powerdowns"><a href="#Epic-powerdowns" class="headerlink" title="Epic powerdowns "></a>Epic powerdowns </h2><h2></h2><p>Here&#x2019;s what I found-<br><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmYVFMMzNsGQ4rhJJBvR2PG93tMzmHQoALed5wcHJYumNt/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I didn&#x2019;t even know the command existed, but apparently when you powerdown you can powerdown from one account into another.  So, when I looked I found that there were 18 accounts that were created back between 3/30/16-4/1/16 roughly all in one night that all started powering down into the one freedom account all at once.  Here are the accounts and here are their account numbers (ie test drive was the 461st account to be created on the block).</p>
<p>The accounts were made 3/31/16 and 4/1/16.<br>@testdrive 461<br>@skywalker 455<br>@simpson 458<br>@paladin 519<br>@moment 569<br>@microsoft 469<br>@klm 557<br>@galaxy 553<br>@firstclass 468<br>@fantasy 473<br>@excalibur 467<br>@eternity 477<br>@disney 564<br>@diaphanous 504<br>@butterfly 577<br>@books 566<br>@commedy 592<br>@bmw 566<br>@blackjack 476<br>@apple<br>@alphabet<br>@bitcoin2016</p>
<p>All of the accounts use pumpkin as a proxy, and there&#x2019;s evidence to me that Pumpkin is another one of the accounts tied to this rather than a separate person being proxied.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmcL58tw1rQPj3m23hoMFxGzuByDqiM4KLuzCRCkFqbwqq/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, then I started wondering how the fuck did they get those funds.  Again.  I started at the wallet, but as you may guess there wasn&#x2019;t a single transaction.  So, the best info I found was at steemd.com/accountname.  I started looking at each one of these.  They all have several pages that look like this.  </p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmfQtdrpa6qJLmsjJALZFFknf4VKwViz1ZY4w9v5WanK6f/image.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="They&#x2019;re-MINERS"><a href="#They&#x2019;re-MINERS" class="headerlink" title="They&#x2019;re MINERS!!! "></a>They&#x2019;re MINERS!!! </h2><h2></h2><p>I wasn&#x2019;t thinking about mining first because mining was gotten rid of months ago.  But these are original accounts.  These are some of the first people.  And mining had a cue system such that you couldn&#x2019;t just mine with 1 account.  You had to have several accounts or you&#x2019;d miss your next step in line.  So, all these accounts were created to ensure they would keep getting back in the loop, but they are all the same person doing it.  That&#x2019;s especially obvious when you check how they collectively decided to powerdown and the information for like 15 accounts is in consecutive blocks.</p>
<p>My leading assumption is that @dan is @pumpkin and @freedom and all these other accounts.  I&#x2019;m not sure about that by any means, but it&#x2019;s my leading theory.  I&#x2019;ve had people tell me who seem pretty certain that pumpkin is Dan, and I&#x2019;m pretty certain that freedom and all the minis are pumpkin, which leads me to believe that they are all Dan.</p>
<p>If that&#x2019;s true it means Dan owns 7.2M steem through @freedom, 4.2M steem through @dan, and an extra 1M liquid steem as @dantheman.  That&#x2019;s 5% of all the steem that exists.  Who knows if he has rights to steem with @steemit account to which owns like 40% of all the steem.  It would certainly stand as an ongoing challenge contributing to a very unequal distribution on the platform.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-it-isn&#x2019;t-Dan"><a href="#what-if-it-isn&#x2019;t-Dan" class="headerlink" title="what if it isn&#x2019;t Dan? "></a>what if it isn&#x2019;t Dan? </h2><h2></h2><p>I started looking at some of the other accounts to figure out if they might be the mega miner.  Here are some of my leading suspects if it isn&#x2019;t Dan.  </p>
<p>@blocktrades 440<br>@val-a 494<br>@mottler 102<br>@ben 491<br>@michael-a 491<br>@michael-b 492<br>@smooth 234 was mining<br>@batel 134 was mining<br>@bob 241 was mining<br>@alice 240 was mining</p>
<p>In my brain you have to be a very early adopter, possibly a Steemit Inc employee, knowledgeable about mining, a decent programmer to get the accounts to all work at the same time.  Freedom is likely an old BTS hound.  You also have to have a great vocabulary if you&#x2019;re dropping diaphanous on a name.  You are also probably 40ish if you&#x2019;re referencing Disney and Excaliber at the same time.  Those are my current thoughts on the kind of person Freedom is.</p>
<p>@berniesanders was a potential, but at one point they are in a flag war, so I&#x2019;m pretty sure it&#x2019;s not the same person.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s also possible there are still more mining smurfs that weren&#x2019;t tapped.  So, maybe there a few other accounts that have 500,000SP that have yet to appear.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m just starting to poke around.  It&#x2019;s like a little mystery to me.  I think there are some good details in account history.  It seems as though the miner checked in occasionally from each of the accounts.  Maybe once a month or so, and I think there might be clues in there too.</p>
<h2 id="Tough-and-personally-dangerous-thoughts-to-share"><a href="#Tough-and-personally-dangerous-thoughts-to-share" class="headerlink" title="Tough and personally dangerous thoughts to share "></a>Tough and personally dangerous thoughts to share </h2><h2></h2><p>I have conflicting feelings if it is Dan.  He&#x2019;s the founder and really the braintrust behind this.  I get that he gets a phat stake in it.  It makes me nervous that on the one hand he&#x2019;s basically left the platform except to pitch for another one (EOS), but is potentially controlling who the top witnesses are.  I mean it&#x2019;s his stake, right. so he gets to do whatever with it, but my challenge is that I&#x2019;m pretty invested here and now I have about 5 other minnows coming out of the Minnow Support Project that have put together witnesses that are focusing on this project (steemit).  </p>
<p>It&#x2019;s a little daunting to think that even if we got all 2600 people that are part of the minnow support project aligned and voting that at this stage it wouldn&#x2019;t account for just one of his previous smurfs.  So, it&#x2019;s hard to come to terms with the stake weighted nature that I love so much with the distribution that plagues this place and Dan may be contributing to that distribution more heavily than anyone else.  </p>
<p>How can I get my minnows to have any stake in this place when they couldn&#x2019;t have taken part in mining or the vast inflationary period?  How can I get my minnows into witness spots when they have to compete with 14GV upvotes at a time?  How can we find an avenue for new people to have any say?</p>
<h2 id="More-questions-than-when-I-started"><a href="#More-questions-than-when-I-started" class="headerlink" title="More questions than when I started "></a>More questions than when I started </h2><h2></h2><p>The ethics are gray to me and I&#x2019;m not even sure @freedom is him&#x2026;  As I said, I have more questions ethically and factually than anything else at this point.</p>

<p>This is cryptopunk.  It&#x2019;s like steampunk or dieselpunk.  It depicts a different kind of life.  This one is scifi based.  You have the freedom loving people of Nagan VII and the bureaucratic Kartouri who seek to rule them.  </p>
<p>Up until now Tanic, the ships captain of the Karouri Peace Enforcers, has attacked the people of Nagan VII at least twice, he was hit with an illegal quantum slider and sent to a different dimension and had to work his way back over the course of more than a year.  He went back with more ships seeking vengence against Nagan VII and particularly Admiral Santana, but got all blowed up.  Santana is about to meet with him after a week of the Kartouri being on Nagan VII.</p>
<hr>
<p>Chapter 2- Episode 2.</p>
<p>&#x201C;One week!  One fuckin&#x2019; week.  Do you have any idea how much trouble these idiots have caused in one week?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sammo, Muxxy, Swelk and Mystique were holding back smiles.  They knew this shit would happen when Santana told them she was going to bring the Kartouri down to the planet.  Bring a bunch of Kart statist idiots to &#x2018;Nage&#x2019; and you&#x2019;re gonna have trouble.</p>
<p>&#x201C;For fuck&#x2019;s sake.  Seriously, 1500 people are causing so much trouble.  We&#x2019;re fuckin&#x2019; helping them.  They came here.  They attacked us.  We didn&#x2019;t even fire, and these dickheads don&#x2019;t know how to act.  You know what one of them said to me?  &#x2018;There wasn&#x2019;t a law against killing the cow on the property so what&#x2019;s the big deal.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Muxxy and Swelk started laughing.  Even Santana crossed a smile.</p>
<p>Rho was a prominent writer and a good friend and walked over to Santana and put a hand on her shoulder.  &#x201C;It&#x2019;s gonna be ok, she said calmly, they&#x2019;ll learn, and when they do go home, they&#x2019;ll take it back with them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Santana&#x2019;s rage subsided a bit.  Yes it was frustrating to deal with all these new people on her planet.  When she&#x2019;s not explaining to another Kart newb how to use a tech tab she&#x2019;s getting constant requests for the simplist tasks.  How do you upload a picture?  I didn&#x2019;t save the planet four times just to sit around and teach you to click the camera icon&#x2026; Oh well, maybe Rho was right.  They&#x2019;ll learn.  She took a deep breath, and then Tanic and the delegation from Kartouri arrived.</p>
<p>The room got awkward quickly.  Tanic and his crew had been there to kill them all a few days back.  Things like that are hard to forget.  Tanic&#x2019;s kid lost an eye and now had a freaky little baby cyborg eye in there instead.  That served as a daily reminder why he should come back a year from now and kill everyone.</p>
<p>Tanic started &#x201C;Admiral Santana, crew, thank you for meeting with us.  The situation on this planet is quite desparate.  Since our capture there has been zero central contact, there&#x2019;s been zero central efforts, I haven&#x2019;t even heard from any specific leader.  Surely, we can negotiate an immediate return of our property.&#x201D;  </p>
<p>&#x201C;Tanic&#x201D; Santana started, &#x201C;It doens&#x2019;t work that way here.  I know it sounds pretty unfamiliar but we don&#x2019;t have a central authority.  The people in this room are your best bet, but we&#x2019;re just people.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic was frustrated.  &#x201C;Surely there is someone we can talk to.  I heard of a Mayor Aggie.  What about him?  There are people called Witnesses.  You have to be able to setup a meeting with them.  The conditions are horrible here.  Where are all the services?  Where do your taxes go to?  I don&#x2019;t even understand how your people have roads!!!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Santana was receiving all this frustrating energy.  She was about to rip&#x2019;em one, but Sammo chimed in instead.  &#x201C;Look mate, it don&#x2019;t work like that &#x2018;ere.  Ain&#x2019;t no taxes, &#x2018;aven&#x2019;t had&#x2019;em in my life.  We each do our own thing and ain&#x2019;t nobody takes what&#x2019;s mine without me agreeing.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic was yelling &#x201C;This place is out of control!!! We&#x2019;ve had over 18 Kartouri, many of them officers, shot with your stun rifles.  Who do we take that to?  Where is our recourse?  How do we get justice for that?  You can&#x2019;t simply shoot an officer of the Kartouri!!!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Santana couldn&#x2019;t let it go &#x201C;Well, what stupid shit were you officers doing huh Tanic?  Were they wandering around with a fucking knife trying to &#x201C;talk&#x201D; to kids?  I&#x2019;d shoot them too.  Nagan doesn&#x2019;t have any laws, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean we don&#x2019;t have principles.  Do no harm but take no shit is about the only rule around here that everyone agrees to.  My guess is that if I dig into each one of those, which I&#x2019;m doing, I&#x2019;m going to find some arrogant piece of shit Kartouri doing something stupid!  How could you come to our planet to kill us when you know so little about us?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic was flustered!  &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not going to hear any more of this.  If you respected our laws it wouldn&#x2019;t be an issue.  You&#x2019;re the terrorist that shot sliders.  How dare you lecture me?  I&#x2019;ll be writing a post about this Santana, and I&#x2019;ll be sure to tag many of your so called Megaloth friends in it.  We&#x2019;ll see what they have to say about it!  In the meantime please make sure you arrange for more food for us.  You&#x2019;d cause much harm if you let us all starve.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic turned in a hurumph to leave, but Santana&#x2019;s wall tech flashed up.  Incoming message stream from Beardo, Subject Tanic&#x2019;s baby :)   Santana said &#x201C;open&#x201D; and the stream opened.  Tanic stopped to hear the news.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hey Santana, I have to run in a second, but I&#x2019;m at the hospital and I just met with Vanessa and baby Tanic.  I can&#x2019;t do anything about them being Kartouri, but the good news is that the burns are healed and mom&#x2019;s back to normal, and the last round of the eye is finished.  Looks a little cyborgian blue, but it was nicely done, most people won&#x2019;t ever know.  I gotta get back to it, love to Rho, peace.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic&#x2019;s frustration melted after hearing his girlfriend and baby were ok.  Margaret probably won&#x2019;t be too happy about it, but he was.  He took a deep breath.  &#x201C;Can we see them now?&#x201D;  Santana&#x2019;s anger melted, she smiled warmly and said &#x201C;Yeah, let&#x2019;s do that.  I&#x2019;ll grab my coat.&#x201D;  </p>
<hr>
<p>As they were taking the deep tubes in silence across from one another she realized that for the first time in the week he&#x2019;d been on Nag that Tanic had said please and asked a question instead of making a demand.  Maybe he can change, and if he can maybe the other Karts can too.  &#x201C;Hey, I&#x2019;m sorry I yelled.&#x201D;  Santana told him.  He just nodded.  &#x201C;Me too.&#x201D;  He said quietly.</p>
<hr>
<p>Chapter 2.  First Flag (<a href="https://steemit.com/cryptopunk/@aggroed/nagan-vii-a-cryptopunk-scifi-series-chapter-2-episode-1-first-flag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/cryptopunk/@aggroed/nagan-vii-a-cryptopunk-scifi-series-chapter-2-episode-1-first-flag</a>)</p>
<p>Tanic woke up and immediately regretted it.  His head was splitting.  He put his hands to his face and felt some bandages and pain.  Seems like he was out on a 3 week straight binger.  Then the swelling and the pulsing in his head.  It hurt.  A lot.  Then he realized he had no idea where he was.  As he looked around it appeared to be a living room, and he was on a fold out couch turned into a bed.  The house was relatively small and as he looked outside he could see some farmland.</p>
<p>He sat up in bed.  He immediately regretted it.  His head felt like a smashed watermelon.  He took a pause to let his brain recalibrate.  There was a techtab on the table with a note from Santana.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, I hope you&#x2019;re ok, sorry your ships got all blowed up, we&#x2019;re working on fixing them minus the weapons.  It&#x2019;s gonna be a bit.  No one really wants to support the people that just attacked us, but I&#x2019;ll get you home.  In the meantime you can login to libertynet.gov where I&#x2019;ve made you the account Kart.Tanic.  It has some script in it too so if you go to town or something you can get what you need.  I don&#x2019;t have any men&#x2019;s clothing since my husband died and I got rid of all his stuff so you&#x2019;re stuck in the uniform for now unless you want a muumuu.  I&#x2019;m heading into town.  I&#x2019;ll be back with dinner.  Please don&#x2019;t do anything dumb if you wake up before I get back.  </p>
<p>PS after I created you account I left a very brief post as your introduction &lt;3 Santana.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He flicked it aside.  Fuck her, I&#x2019;m gonna strangle her with my bare hands.  </p>
<p>He stood up and felt woozy, but fought through it.  He walked into the kitchen and found a knife and a piece of bread and an apple.  He ate the apple, put the bread in his pocket and walked outside with the knife in his hand.  </p>
<p>Santana lived on a small homestead over an hour outside of Nagnarok.  It was a nice plantation that help a variety of animals and vegetables, rain water collection, and even LENR power.  He could use the tech tab to communicate, but he was sure it was all being watched.  So, he headed down the road looking for someone.  As it turns out he found a group of kids walking his way.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hey, Hey you kids.  Come here!&#x201D;  </p>
<p>The kids saw a half crazed man with a bandage on his head weilding a knife asking for the kids to come over.  They did what sensible kids would do and they ran.  Tanic took two steps to follow them, and immediately regretted it.  He put his hand on his head and sat down from the pain.  A minute or two later he got up and started walking down the road again.  This time a farmer with a few kids got out of an air cruiser (a hover car) and approached him weapon raised.  &#x201C;I think you were talking to my boys in a most unfriendly way sir?  You ok?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic saw the gun and knew he had a chance to get a weapon.  So, he put the knife behind is back and walked slowly toward the man saying &#x201C;Look friend, I&#x2019;m sorry about your boys,  I was just having a little fun.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The farmer said &#x201C;Sir, I know you have the knife, please stop.  Put it down and let&#x2019;s talk about how to get you well son.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic ignored him and pressed on &#x201C;Look sir, I&#x2019;m just looking for a way into town, I seem to have had a little trouble and now I just need to contact some of my friends and settle all of this.&#x201D;  He took another step and was now pretty close to the farmer so he lunged with the knife, he immediately regretted it.  Before he got anywhere he felt 10k joules shooting through him.  He hit the ground writhing in agony, and passed out.</p>
<hr>
<p>He woke up some time later with the tech tab on his chest with a note from Santana.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#x2019;m in the garden.  Seriously, please don&#x2019;t do anything stupid.  Just log into the tech tab and try not to do anything violent today.  I&#x2019;ll have some food and water for you soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He opened up the techtab.  Logged in as Kart.Tanic on libertynet.gov.  Santana&#x2019;s first post for him read-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi, I&#x2019;m Tanic.  I just attacked your planet.  I&#x2019;m from the Kartouri.  I&#x2019;m going to be staying with Santana for a while as my ship is being fixed.  I&#x2019;ll talk to you soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the replies were just automatic spambots and welcome bots for a variety of groups.  One or two people said hi.  A few had some insults for having attacked him.  What really bothered him though was that one vote came in red and appeared to be a flag.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From FarmerMike<br>This dude&#x2019;s a dick.  Not only tried to bomb our planet but also threatened my kids with a knife.  What a tool.  Next time don&#x2019;t come at a man with a loaded rifle.  Next time I&#x2019;ll use shots and not volts.  Enjoy your first flag asshole.</p>

<p>Well, here they are, your finalists, for STEEEMFEST MINNOW.  Please give them a round of applause.  We&#x2019;re at the final stage of this.  One of these minnows is going to STEEMFEST on an all expense paid trip.  Second and Third will get 150 SBD between them. We&#x2019;re down to 11 as @rondonson secured a flight through an @steemfestdreams contest and @nikkig hasn&#x2019;t been seen on the platform for 12-14 days, and no response from @stormriderstudio.</p>
<h2 id="Judging-rules"><a href="#Judging-rules" class="headerlink" title="Judging rules "></a>Judging rules </h2><h2></h2><ol>
<li>Everyone of the invited judges will score the 10 participants.  They will provide me with a number 1-10.  Their first pick gets a 1 and their last pick gets a 10.  I&#x2019;m going to try to gather 6 or so judges in addition to me.</li>
<li>The audience can vote on who they think should win.  For any contestant you think should go please write their name in a brand new comment.  I&#x2019;ll tally up the number of votes and the person with the most votes will get a score of 1, then 2 and so on.</li>
<li>The budget will play a role.  $500 and under will be scored a 1.  $1000 and under will be scored a 2.  $1500 and under will be scored a 3, and anything over $1500 and over will be scored a 4.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#x2019;ll add them all up and then it&#x2019;s golf rules who wins ie the person with the lowest tally comes in first.  If there is a tie the person with the most audience votes will win.</p>
<p>All judging, including audience, is due by 11:59pm New York Time on Sunday night.  </p>
<h2 id="Judging-Thoughts"><a href="#Judging-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Judging Thoughts "></a>Judging Thoughts </h2><h2></h2><p>It&#x2019;s a fair amount of money to send someone to Steemfest.  I invite the judges to think of it as an investment into a person on behalf of the Steemit and Minnow community.  Which finalist do you think we&#x2019;ll get the most bang for our buck by sending there?</p>
<p>The winners will be announced on Monday on the @minnowsupport wall as the weekly resteem resumes.</p>
<p>Please give it up for the MINNOWS!  They have done a great job and I&#x2019;m so excited to see how far they&#x2019;ve come in such a short time!  NEXT STOP LISBON!</p>

            <p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmRFfFvrEetzeEukYZAJmUP6vMvPj7ER2KuuYCw5ssx9fH/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s talk a little more about how a bitbot works so that you guys are spending the correct amount of money and getting more money back than what you put in.</p>
<p>The max post reward every 36 min is 80 cents.  That&#x2019;s based on USDs. </p>
<p>The minimum bid is 0.01SBD.  For the purpose of this, let&#x2019;s assume that an SBD is worth 2 cents.</p>
<p>Ok, so, here&#x2019;s what happens you&#x2019;re betting 2 cents and hoping to win 80 cents.  If you get this you win 40x your bid/bet!  That&#x2019;s pretty awesome!!!  You shouldn&#x2019;t bid more than 80 cents because it&#x2019;s a losing bid every time (unless you want to support this little bot or other minnows who use it).</p>
<h2 id="Easy-split-pot-example"><a href="#Easy-split-pot-example" class="headerlink" title="Easy split pot example "></a>Easy split pot example </h2><h2></h2><p>If someone else comes along and bids 2 cents as well, then you&#x2019;re going to split the pot and each of you will get 40 cents in post rewards.  That&#x2019;s 20x your return.  That&#x2019;s still pretty crazy!</p>
<h2 id="uneven-split-bids"><a href="#uneven-split-bids" class="headerlink" title="uneven split bids "></a>uneven split bids </h2><h2></h2><p>You bid a little and they bid a lot.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s say they bid .18 sbd and you bid 0.02.  The pot will be split so that bigboy gets 90% of the rewards and you only get 10% of the rewards.  So, with 0.18sbd they will get 70ish cents.  You&#x2019;ll get sevenish.  Still a return, but you can see as more people are bidding or some people are putting in bigger bets it&#x2019;s not as good of a deal.</p>
<h2 id="Perfect-timing"><a href="#Perfect-timing" class="headerlink" title="Perfect timing "></a>Perfect timing </h2><h2></h2><p>The perfect time to bid is when no one else has bid anything.  Drop 0.01SBD and you&#x2019;ll get 70-80 cents back.  That&#x2019;s perfect.  Maybe put in a friend&#x2019;s URL instead of your own :)</p>
<h2 id="Bad-timing"><a href="#Bad-timing" class="headerlink" title="Bad timing "></a>Bad timing </h2><h2></h2><p>Check the wallet.  If you see a lot of people putting in small bids.  Or one guy putting in a large bid then don&#x2019;t bid then.  You might not get a return.</p>
<h2 id="Terrible-friendly-bids"><a href="#Terrible-friendly-bids" class="headerlink" title="Terrible/friendly bids "></a>Terrible/friendly bids </h2><h2></h2><p>The max reward is 80 cents.  Don&#x2019;t bid on anything near 0.5 SBD or more because after that there isn&#x2019;t enough pot rewards from this to pay for your bet/bid.  So, if you bid higher than 0.5SBD you either like me/this bot and want it to help other minnows or you don&#x2019;t understand math and have made a bad judgement call.</p>
<h2 id="It&#x2019;s-meant-to-be-fun-and-helpful"><a href="#It&#x2019;s-meant-to-be-fun-and-helpful" class="headerlink" title="It&#x2019;s meant to be fun and helpful "></a>It&#x2019;s meant to be fun and helpful </h2><h2></h2><p>Keep your bids small.  Check the wallet on lovejuice to see if anyone else is bidding.  You may want to wait a bit and come back.  But about 50 times a day you can put in 0.01SBD and get 70-80 cents back.</p>
<h2 id="Be-friendly"><a href="#Be-friendly" class="headerlink" title="Be friendly "></a>Be friendly </h2><h2></h2><p>Want to make a friend?  This is a pretty simple way beyond just upvoting their post to perform a nice gesture for someone else.  It doesn&#x2019;t cost more than a penny and it&#x2019;s  thoughtful.  Consider putting the vote on another person.  I mean with HF19 you only get so many upvotes a day before power drains.  Here&#x2019;s a way you can put an 80cent vote on something without using one of your minnow votes, make a friend, and help other minnows by supporting this bot.  The bot will leave a comment saying the vote came from you, so they&#x2019;ll know if they check their replies.</p>
<p>You might catch a follower.  You might make a friend.  You could get resteems.  You could catch upvotes.  You may find your posts get some friendly lovejuice too.  This platform amplifies kindness.  My guess is that if you start using this on other people it&#x2019;ll get repaid many times over.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-bid"><a href="#how-to-bid" class="headerlink" title="how to bid "></a>how to bid </h2><h2></h2><p>Send a transfer of 0.01sbd or more to @lovejuice.  In the memo copy/paste the post url you are interested in using.  Do, a few for your own posts, but again I suggest doing it as a gift to others to make friends and be a nice person.</p>

<p>Let&#x2019;s break down the pledge so that people see where Americans are taught to Americate from the tender age of 6 through the beginning of their adult lives may not actually be in the interest of peace, abundance, and liberty.  I like to do these things the before or after so folks aren&#x2019;t maximum triggered.</p>
<h2 id="I-pledge-allegiance-to-the-flag"><a href="#I-pledge-allegiance-to-the-flag" class="headerlink" title="I pledge allegiance to the flag "></a>I pledge allegiance to the flag </h2><h2></h2><blockquote>
<p>See, when you start doing this at the age of six roughly 250 times a year for the next 12 or so years it looks less like a sweet gesture and more like you&#x2019;re indocturnating children into a ritualistic pattern of obedience towards actions of the state.<br>I have reason to believe &#x201C;The Flag&#x201D; is actually a trade name for the USG, INC.  It&#x2019;s not as simple as pledging to a colored piece of cloth.  It actually means the corporation that runs this place.</p>

<p>This again isn&#x2019;t actually the dejure government that you think it is.  The act of 1871 created an illegal district in the actual Republic and it&#x2019;s one of the starting points of the Government Services Corporation pretending to be the actual government.</p>

<p>So, here it&#x2019;s actually recognizing that the flag and the Republic aren&#x2019;t actually the same thing.  It&#x2019;s simply representing it.  The actual living government crafted through the Articles of Confederation  and up through the original Constitution containing the actual 13th amendment that was ratified still exists&#x2026; but it&#x2019;s been abandoned for years.  And these corporate assholes just point to it and say, well we&#x2019;re not them, but we represent them.</p>

<p>Creepy fact.  The USG, INC is actually a religious non-profit registered I believe in Delaware.  I&#x2019;m sure nation has it&#x2019;s own special meaning that I&#x2019;ve been meaning to look up in Black&#x2019;s Law Dictionary.  It&#x2019;s not what you think.</p>

<h2 id="With-Liberty-and-Justice-for-All"><a href="#With-Liberty-and-Justice-for-All" class="headerlink" title="With Liberty and Justice for All "></a>With Liberty and Justice for All </h2><h2></h2><blockquote>
<p>Ummm&#x2026; we seem to have different definitions of Liberty.  Having to present papers and get my testicals groped by blue gloved TSA agents is a profoundly different definition.  As for justice&#x2026; it&#x2019;s corporate law.  It&#x2019;s admirality law.  It&#x2019;s maritime law.  It&#x2019;s strawman law.  How can you have actual justice when the court judges are administrators abusing their position and falsely representing their law through a series of uncontested presumptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#x2019;s basically a 150 year falsehood that&#x2019;s perpetuated in school&#x2019;s all across this country, but the truth is the actual government had to stop functioning during the civil war because there wasn&#x2019;t a quarum anymore.  So, Abe et. al created a government services corporation claiming to represent the real thing with a copy cat constitution to keep it going.  We haven&#x2019;t had a true functioning government since then, but the good news is that these people are crooks and phonies and if we work together we can change this system by exposing what they&#x2019;ve done.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hey all,  I&#x2019;m upping my bot game.  Thanks to @inertia and his DrOtto bot (and 30 min of help from @reggaemuffin) I&#x2019;m in it to win it for Minnows.  Here&#x2019;s the deal.  I&#x2019;m running Dr. Otto through my own little oddbot named @lovejuice.  It&#x2019;s a voting bot for minnows.  It only has ~8k power so you can rest assured the dolphins and whales won&#x2019;t care about this baby, but you should and that&#x2019;s perfect.</p>
<p>Looks like a full vote gives out about $0.80 cents and comes with a bizarre image and a bizarre comment.  To make it work send a minimum of 0.010 sbd to @lovejuice with the memo of the post you want it to upvote.  Check its wallet first before you upvote though.  Because if more than 8 minnows happen to be going at the same time then you&#x2019;ll lose money on this.</p>
<p>That said, unlike the other big monsters that either vote too often and die or vote too infrequently so that you&#x2019;re up against monster whale ballz outbidding you this little guy votes once every 36 min.  That should be enough to keep the lovejuice flowing all over your posts, but not so much that you&#x2019;re competing against the whole steemit community.</p>
<p>If the mild sexual humor is too much I recommend not using it.  If you think it&#x2019;s funny then share @lovejuice with your friends and spray dank amps on their wall too.  It&#x2019;s just meant for fun.  Looks to be working so have at it.</p>
<p>For more info on DrOtto check here- <a href="https://steemit.com/radiator/@inertia/dr-otto-vote-bidding-bot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/radiator/@inertia/dr-otto-vote-bidding-bot</a></p>
<p>PS works just like @booster but with less SP and more votes per day.</p>

<p>Also, short milestone post&#x2026; ugh&#x2026; I broke 3k followers.  Feeling kinda pimp.  /flex  So, thanks to everyone that follows me.  Love to MSP.  You guys float my boat.  And if you&#x2019;re a minnow wondering when you finally get a bot you can afford&#x2026; Here it is.</p>
