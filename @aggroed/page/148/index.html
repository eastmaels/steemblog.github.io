<p>Yeah, so it turns out you can&#x2019;t give everyone a free lambo with linear rewards and then quadruple the Dank Amps (rewards) of those mega votes without consequences.  In this case we&#x2019;re watching the rewards pool drain.</p>

The Circle Jerk was sooo huge that it&#x2019;s just started eating the rewards pool.  That first day when we were giving $8K to some of the biggest authors is more akin to promising them like 7% of the rewards pool, but we did it to multiple authors, and everyone else was making more, so we promised more than 100% of the rewards pool that day.  So, it drained.</p>

<p>As you can see the reward pool is going down.  Look at the slope of that curve.  </p>
<p>(@me-tarzan Thanks for tracking that.  I should probably ask you about including it here, but I&#x2019;m also promoting you and your post.  I&#x2019;m a little unclear on the ethics.  HMU if you feel robbed by me in addition to robbed by the pool)</p>

<p>That slope remind you of any other?  Oh, shit.  It looks kinda looks like the drain on the reward pool!  Correlation isn&#x2019;t causation, but I&#x2019;m going out on a limb and saying what I&#x2019;m seeing are linked.</p>
<h2 id="So-what-happens-next"><a href="#So-what-happens-next" class="headerlink" title="So, what happens next? "></a>So, what happens next? </h2><h2></h2><p>What happens next is that the reward pool is going to drain until it reaches equilibrium with the speed with which these mega votes are draining it.  It&#x2019;ll look like the post rewards in trending and other places have stabilized and are now lower (/cheer) but what has happened is the biggest giveaway to already rich posters and that much given to them has lowered the rewards of everyone else and will continue to do so until it stabilizes more (/stopcheeringandcryinside).</p>
<p>Funs over everyone.  Go back to where you were before.  Yes your minnow vote is worth more, but with the pool drained by the top posters it&#x2019;s gonna even out and ultimately not  really help you.  Sorry your views are down, sorry you can&#x2019;t vote on more than 10 things a day without draining your voting power, and sorry this may have killed your inter-minnow communication thing too.  But we handed out a lot of steem to the richest among us and biggest users among us.  So it was all worth it!</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s gonna look like a victory cause trending is down, but we just handed a lot higher of a percent to the biggest authors of what is now a much smaller pool for everyone.  I think I remember reading someone suggesting there might be issues with this HF and some unintended consequences of it&#x2026;</p>

Commenting has gone up TWOFOLD since this hardfork.  People are now actively commenting more and literally twice as much of the reward pool is going there.</p>

Yeah&#x2026; well it turns out that drains the pool too.  Pretty sure we didn&#x2019;t all miraculously decide to love one another&#x2019;s posts more and spend twice as much in the comments section on someone else.  We&#x2019;re now just mooning our own comments.  So, sad panda on that.  Seems like giving everyone the ability to free lambo the shit out of themselves didn&#x2019;t do as much for balanced curation as we were promised.</p>
<h2 id="A-radical-idea"><a href="#A-radical-idea" class="headerlink" title="A radical idea "></a>A radical idea </h2><h2></h2><p>Can we go back to 40 votes for starters?  It seems part, if not all of this, was a bad idea.  I remember someone saying something about this being a bad idea before I got here too&#x2026; Here&#x2019;s some perspective from the white paper (@dantheman).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to realign incentives and discourage individuals from simply voting for themselves, money must be distributed in a nonlinear manner. For example a quadratic function in votes, i.e., someone with twice the votes of someone else should receive four times the payout and someone with three times the votes should receive nine times the payout. In other words, the reward is proportional to &#x200B;votes2&#x200B;&#x200B;rather than &#x200B;votes. This mirrors the value of network effect which grows with &#x200B;n2&#x200B;&#x200B;the number of participants, according to Metcalfe&#x2019;s Law</p>
<p>Assuming all users have equal stake, someone who only receives their own vote will receive much less than someone who receives votes from 100 different users. This encourages users to &#x200B;cooperate to vote for the same things to maximize the payout. This system also creates financial incentive to &#x200B;collude where everyone votes on one thing and then divides the reward equally among themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Other-than-that-Everything-IS-AWESOME"><a href="#Other-than-that-Everything-IS-AWESOME" class="headerlink" title="Other than that Everything IS AWESOME!!!! "></a>Other than that Everything IS AWESOME!!!! </h2><h2></h2><p>We ultimately have a distribution problem.  Back end hacking linear rewards was meant to fix that.  It appears to have worked out well in some ways and had some pretty crappy consequences in others</p>

<p>Nothing like a little MS Paint to help you explain how you&#x2019;re feeling post Hard Fork!  So, we don&#x2019;t have a rewards curve anymore.  We have a rewards coaster.  It&#x2019;s pretty thrilling at the start, but it leaves me crying on the inside a few days later.</p>

If you&#x2019;re at $1500 it brings it down to like $1,000.  Same percent, but now it&#x2019;s $500.  Maybe that&#x2019;s good for minnows?  Tough to get a read on since I&#x2019;m only now really starting to see it.  I wonder if this is adjustment or the new normal.  Ironically my posts are making more, but by the end it feels like less since it went down 33%.</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>

<p>The universe teaches through contrast.  So, I&#x2019;ve made a highly bureaucratic government the antagonist and a free loving libertarian voluntaryst community the protagonist.  Let&#x2019;s see what happens to Admiral Santanta.</p>
<h2 id="CH1-Episode-3-Plummeting-with-a-Techtab-and-Solarnet&#x201D;"><a href="#CH1-Episode-3-Plummeting-with-a-Techtab-and-Solarnet&#x201D;" class="headerlink" title="CH1 Episode 3 Plummeting with a Techtab and Solarnet&#x201D;"></a>CH1 Episode 3 Plummeting with a Techtab and Solarnet&#x201D;</h2><p>For a lot of people dropping at above mach speeds plummeting towards the ground in a hunk of steel labelled &#x201C;life support ship&#x201D; you&#x2019;d probably be freaked out of your mind, screaming, or passed out.  But to Santana this was just another day at the office.  When you fight for freedom your ship&#x2019;s gonna get blown up a few times.  Oh well, the last couple life boats worked out ok.</p>
<p>She knows the drill by now.  When she saw 3 torps coming in post slider heading for baby-3 she knew what was up.  Hit the big red &#x201C;abandon ship&#x201D; button, punch in the code, grab her techtab, retrieve the video logs, and hop in the life boat.  A lot of her crew and friends were dead.  That happens too&#x2026;  There&#x2019;s gonna be a long bath and a few bottles of wine for today, and by wine she means straight gin.  Mistakes demand their due.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the task at hand.  She pulls out the techtab and logs into solarnet.  Luckily reception is good because she can see the satellite about 1 click from her head.  </p>
<p>&#x201C;Tarthi, pull up libertygov.net for me please.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Libertygov.net pulls up.  Woah, 320,412 new messages.  Oh, right.  She was broadcasting the fight with the raiders.  I guess they&#x2019;re paying attention.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Tarthi, submit new post.&#x201D;</p>
<p>-New Post Ready</p>
<p>&#x201C;Tarthi, roll film&#x201D;</p>
<p>3, 2, 1</p>
<p>Hi guys.  This is Admiral Santana floating back to home.  As you can see it&#x2019;s a little rough in the atmosphere right now.  I think I&#x2019;m falling at about 534megalons per second.  Anyway, as you might have seen, I had a little run in with the Kartouri Raiders.  Good news is that the planet is safe and none of you are dead.  I can&#x2019;t wait to see you mom.  The bad news is that they blew up my ship.  I try not to ask you guys for too much, but seeing as I did just save the planet again if you could kindly upvote this so I can get a new ship and keep the planet safe that&#x2019;d be really awesome.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m hoping for some improvements, so if a few megaloths could hit it with their megaloth balls or just DM some Liberty Scripts to my wallet that would be great.  I think the shields need moar power.  Also, I seem to have lost some crew so if you&#x2019;re ready to die to keep this place safe from the Karts then hit me up when I land.</p>
<p>Love you guys and thanks for your support.  </p>
<p>Peace, Abundance, and Liberty to you all.</p>
<p>Links below in case you missed the fight!</p>
<p>Santana out.</p>
<h2 id="Episode-2"><a href="#Episode-2" class="headerlink" title="Episode 2 "></a>Episode 2 </h2><h2></h2><p>60 seconds ago Captain Tanic Elotaw of the Dreadnaught class ship Peace Enforcer 782215 was an extremely happy man.<br>55 seconds ago he had damaged just about every last weapon system of the terrorist flagship Unsanctioned Peace Defiance 01500-7.<br>50 seconds ago his chief weapons officer had successfully taken their main thrusters offline with a precision rail gun disabling impact.<br>45 seconds ago he recorded a highly dampened energy signal suggesting the ship&#x2019;s main power was severely compromised.<br>40 seconds he saw all the shields finally go offline.<br>35 seconds ago he saw a life form readout suggesting that 72% of the suspected lifeforms had been neutralized.<br>30 seconds ago he received a surrender message from Planet 143-2 in known system 45-66-2, the main host of the terrorist insurrection 15-11889-302.<br>25 seconds ago his chief medical officer confirmed Admiral Santana was still alive and would be available for detention and interrogation.<br>20 seconds ago there was a heat signature launched from the terrorist vessel.<br>15 seconds ago counter measures were taken.<br>10 seconds ago those counter measures failed to destroy the ballasitc.<br>5 seconds ago a sphere emanated from the warhead.<br>Now he was no longer happy.</p>
<p>Tanic tugged down on the bottom of his stiff uniform.  Calm and control was needed.  He realized while looking at his display that the ballastic was likely a quantum slider, and he was likely in a parallel dimension in an unknown time and space along with approximately 62% of his ship that happened to be enveloped in the slide.  If enough of the ship was left in tact a supra reality frequency jump through a quantum singularity might get him back.  Normally, he&#x2019;d be pissed, but 3 peace keeping zero gravity advanced targeted thrust tubes (torpedoes) were launched before slider impact and the last readouts on his screen suggested they escaped the slide sphere.  3 red blips were on their way to eliminate the threat imposed by the Peace Defiance vessel and &#x201C;Admiral&#x201D; Santana was likely littered over space as 1,000 or more frozen blood, bone, and flesh debris floating into nothingness .  </p>
<p>One engine should be enough to get back, but will he get back at the right time to see her die with his very own eyes?</p>

This is the best way to act on the platform if your goal is to make it as hard for yourself to grow as possible.</p>
<h2 id="Epix-rnts"><a href="#Epix-rnts" class="headerlink" title="Epix rnts! "></a>Epix rnts! </h2><h2></h2><p>First off.  F4F is a bad plan.  Welcome to dead follower land.  It&#x2019;s one thing if you&#x2019;re both in a channel designed for a social cause.  &#x201C;Hey, you wanna make sure dolphins get boners?  Me too!!! F4F?&#x201D;  (that&#x2019;s a Tosh reference).  Ok, that&#x2019;s like the one place where it&#x2019;s acceptable.  Where it isn&#x2019;t acceptable is everywhere else.  What kind of fair weather asshole follower do you think this person is gonna be?  They aren&#x2019;t really intersted in your growth.  They don&#x2019;t care about you or your content.  They are thinking numbers and follower count.  So, yeah, you got a follower, but when you go off to write that epx pst for 5 hours for your 29 followers you get 2 views.  Those were the two that really cared about dolphin boners!</p>
<h2 id="Don&#x2019;t-be-that-guy"><a href="#Don&#x2019;t-be-that-guy" class="headerlink" title="Don&#x2019;t be that guy!

Anyone that&#x2019;s been here for a week knows it&#x2019;s a dumb proposition and it doesn&#x2019;t really help anyone.  You&#x2019;re just waving your hand in a crowd and saying &#x201C;Hey, I&#x2019;m an asshat lookin&#x2019; for suckers!  Are you one?&#x201D;</p>
<h2 id="Fre-Lambos"><a href="#Fre-Lambos" class="headerlink" title="Fre Lambos "></a>Fre Lambos </h2><h2></h2><p>Steemit takes work.  You don&#x2019;t get there in a week.  You can&#x2019;t start with nothing and no followers and no group from facebook or youtube and hope to come here and be a whale in a week.  I know a few people that catch some whale votes on their first couple posts, but that&#x2019;s about it.  Most people have to spend weeks trying to catch a post with 15 views and $2 in dank amps (post rewards).  So, the people that are telling you how awesome it&#x2019;ll be if you do the things they tell you to do and it&#x2019;ll be easy quick cash&#x2026; they&#x2019;re scamming you.  Don&#x2019;t do it.  You&#x2019;ll regret it and feel dirty and used the next day.</p>
<h2 id="Post-promotion"><a href="#Post-promotion" class="headerlink" title="Post promotion "></a>Post promotion </h2><h2></h2><p>Whether you&#x2019;re working with @acidyo in steemit chat (when it&#x2019;s up&#x2026; ZING) or if you&#x2019;re in one of the Discord rooms you&#x2019;re going to run into channels.  Now I know you want to promote your post, but nothing makes you look like a bigger asshole then running into general chat and saying hey &#x201C;upvote my dolphin boner post&#x201D; as your very first interaction.  It&#x2019;s even worse when you&#x2019;re doing that as a DM to dolphins and whales.  If you&#x2019;re spamming you probably don&#x2019;t know anything about them.  You probably don&#x2019;t give a shit about them and their wants.  You probably just want the votes, influence, and interaction with followers that they took months to create and you want the benefit from after a whopping 3 days on the platform. </p>
<p>Look, if you find a channel that&#x2019;s titled &#x201C;dolphin erection enthusiasts&#x201D; by all means post there, but the general channel or something like a music channel isn&#x2019;t an appropriate place for the post.  It doesn&#x2019;t make you awesome or cool for posting there.  It makes you look like an extremely disrespectful asswipe that shouldn&#x2019;t be upvoted, shouldn&#x2019;t be followed, and shouldn&#x2019;t get free lambos.</p>

You&#x2019;re likely to catch flags for days.  Thought it was hard getting anywhere on the platform with a 25 rep?  Try it with a -7 and a couple of pissed off whale accounts flagging everything you make.  It&#x2019;s just dumb.</p>
<h2 id="You-got-your-shitty-follower-group-and-posts-in-the-wrong-spot-Now-what"><a href="#You-got-your-shitty-follower-group-and-posts-in-the-wrong-spot-Now-what" class="headerlink" title="You got your shitty follower group and posts in the wrong spot.

You should go into a cave with a typewriter and write your masterpiece.  No one has ever had that same thought about SBD price increase/decrease/problem/solution/value before.  You are a unique snowflake and you should put it everywhere on the platform you can think of.  Then you should go post it on every facebook page and reddit/subreddit in the world.  @everyone will love you.  Free lambos right around the corner.  Then you find out that only 4 people viewed it, and 2 clicked on the wrong post.  You&#x2019;re sitting there all pissed off that this place sucks and no one votes your content.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-you-actually-do"><a href="#what-should-you-actually-do" class="headerlink" title="what should you actually do?

Friends that share similar intersts will read your posts, suggest fixes, offer resteems, and make introductions for you.  They will help you find tools and communities to support you.  They&#x2019;ll make this journey easier.  The best way to do this on the blockchain when you&#x2019;re starting is to comment on posts you like from authors with similar interests.  &#x201C;Cool post&#x201D; won&#x2019;t get you far, but a gif/meme or a thoughtful comment can easily catch a big vote or get a follower who actually appreciates you.  When you get a couple hundred followers then it&#x2019;s time to switch gears to writing more and with all those friends you&#x2019;ll actually get some traction.</p>
<p>What if you wanna do something offline?  Discord, facebook, and some other places have social groups.  I manage the Minnow Support Project and know that the number one way that Minnows stop being minnows is to make friends.  Turns out the fastest way isn&#x2019;t by shoving your posts at them, but instead to just say &#x201C;hi&#x201D; ask questions, and at least fake genuine interest for a while.</p>
<h2 id="When-talking-to-whales"><a href="#When-talking-to-whales" class="headerlink" title="When talking to whales "></a>When talking to whales </h2><h2></h2><p>Please don&#x2019;t link a post and say &#x201C;hey review this.&#x201D;  I know what you&#x2019;re doing.  It isn&#x2019;t cool.  You&#x2019;re not tricky.  You&#x2019;re not fooling me.  In fact it makes me think you think I&#x2019;m an asshole that can&#x2019;t figure out what you&#x2019;re doing.  You don&#x2019;t know anything about me.  If you did you&#x2019;d know I don&#x2019;t really care about Dolphin erections.  So, when you push that post at me I&#x2019;m inclined to think you&#x2019;re a dick that should be avoided.  If you realize that I&#x2019;m all about helping minnows it&#x2019;s better to start with a post like &#x201C;Hey @aggroed, I saw that you run a big Discord group all about supporting minnows.  I have a great idea that I think will help them?  Have you ever thought about hosting a dolphin erection party?  It&#x2019;s a great social cause and I think it could help minnows!!!&#x201D;</p>
<p>See, that&#x2019;s at least interesting&#x2026; I mean what the fuck is a dolphin erection party?  I&#x2019;ve never heard of that.  I&#x2019;m at least willing to have 1 more sentence of conversation about it, but if all you do is non-consensually shove your post in my DM feed I&#x2019;m gonna get cranky.  I don&#x2019;t know you, I don&#x2019;t know your content, I don&#x2019;t know why I should care, and I don&#x2019;t know how you&#x2019;re helping me do the shit I think is important.  Now I have to look at your message so it&#x2019;ll go away and then I have to figure out if it&#x2019;s worth flagging you into oblivion.</p>

The content might catch them the first time, but after that it&#x2019;s often about the friendship and wanting to support your buddy.  I don&#x2019;t want a stranger coming up to me and hitting me with a 15 SBD contest for shit I don&#x2019;t care about asking me to review it and resteem it especialy when it&#x2019;s already 4 days old with 3 views.  But come to me in Discord, talk about what you&#x2019;re passionate about, and tell me how you think you could help other Minnows an you&#x2019;re gonna get my attention.  It&#x2019;s not that I hate contests.  It&#x2019;s that I don&#x2019;t like spending my precious time only on self centered people.</p>
<h2 id="Catching-flak"><a href="#Catching-flak" class="headerlink" title="Catching flak "></a>Catching flak </h2><h2></h2><p>The last time I did a snarky post like this I caught a little flak from folks that thought I&#x2019;ve changed and become shitty.  I spend about 6 hrs a day helping minnows grow.  There&#x2019;s about 1400 of them in the MSP channel.  What I&#x2019;m doing is showing you what works and what doesn&#x2019;t.  If you think I&#x2019;m wrong go right ahead and actually do the shitty things in the title.  Let me know how it goes.  I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll get fre Lambo by snday.</p>

<p>Here are the 32 contestants for STEEMFEST MINNOW.  These folks have created a post and submitted it in the comments of the previous STEEMFEST MINNOW post.  Please read these posts.  If you want one of them to be a finalist then please make an individual comment for them with only their steemit handle.  So, for example, if I want aggroed to get the all expense paid trip to STEEMFEST then I&#x2019;d write a comment and only leave &#x201C;@aggroed&#x201D; in it.  That&#x2019;s one vote for aggroed.  5 people with the most unique mentions by unique commenters will be guaranteed a finalist contender spot.  </p>
<p>I&#x2019;ll announce finalists on Thursday and work with several judges to collect scores of those 10 accounts and choose 1 winner for the all expense paid trip.The winner as well as 1st and 2nd runner up will be announced on Monday a week from today on the @minnowsupport wall.  The weekly resteem will start again then too through the @minnowsupport account.</p>

<p>I recently hit 300 witness votes.  I ran for public office before and I&#x2019;ve held public office before.  I earned 6,000 votes in the last election I participated in.   I can tell you these witness ones feel way more important to me.  This is the future that I see in the world.  I want a world of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  I&#x2019;m shocked by how easily Steem seems to create abundance.  The ability of the stake holders to print money and give to worthy causes is freaking amazing.  It&#x2019;s so encouraging, and we&#x2019;ve been able to build a great community around it.  </p>
<p>The Minnow Support Project Discord room has grow to over 1300 unique people in 10 days.  We have 7 witnesses constantly in there checking on people and curating minnow posts.  We often have 200 or more &#x201C;fish&#x201D; hanging out in the &#x201C;pond.&#x201D;  The general chat is pretty much around the clock.  We have a ton of channels opened up to general interests, groups of people, languages, art, and writing.  It&#x2019;s still growing like gangbusters, which is of course supported by the delegation we get from @neoxian for 20k SP, @benjojo for 90k SP, and now the minnows themselves have started delegating.  We have roughly a dozen people who are delegating over 5000 SP to the project.  @minnowsupport is now rocking out 117,000 SP, which we&#x2019;re dolling out to over 1400 posts a day curated by roughly 800 people.</p>
<p>Within the big community we are sparking little communities and I wanted to highlight some of the cool projects and people we&#x2019;re supporting, growing a space for, and watching rise up: </p>

<h2 id="Venezuela"><a href="#Venezuela" class="headerlink" title="Venezuela "></a>Venezuela </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m very concerned about the plight of Venezuelans.  They have a raw deal for sure right now.  I&#x2019;ve been going through and upvoting new folks from their country, which you can find here:  <a href="https://steemit.com/created/retovenezuela" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/created/retovenezuela</a>.  I was tipped off to that channel by @cryptohustlin.  I&#x2019;m not the only one that came through and did that.  @thejohalfiles, and @canadian-coconut voted on a lot of them shortly afterward.  Their hourly wage is about $0.09.  You can imagine what it&#x2019;s going to feel like logging back in and seeing $100 posts in their blog.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve been doing what I can to work with @efrageek and @road2wisdom to get a Spanish channel going in the PALnet Discord channel.  I believe in the power of building these microcommunities and think this is a great way to support the people separated by language or economic hard times.</p>
<p>Check out the white paper for their project here: <a href="https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@provenezuela/project-venezuela-official-launch-white-paper-english-version-1497914210-8695834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@provenezuela/project-venezuela-official-launch-white-paper-english-version-1497914210-8695834</a></p>
<h2 id="Vets"><a href="#Vets" class="headerlink" title="Vets "></a>Vets </h2><h2></h2><p>I have taught high school and college science courses before.  It was mostly at military schools.  I love the men and women that love this country enough to defend it.  I&#x2019;m a major peacenic and hate how we send them to 3rd world nations to kill dark skinned people for oil and resources, but it&#x2019;s not the kid&#x2019;s fault.  They were brought up in a school system that fostered the sense of &#x201C;the other,&#x201D; and a willingness to kill because they are so different and to protect their home.  The logic is flawed, but it took me 30 years to figure that out.  Can&#x2019;t blame the kid.  Now the kids come back with emotional scars from having committed such pain and you can see it in the numbers.  Vet homeless rate is through the roof, and they come back afflicted with so many ailments.  There are so many good kids in there and I&#x2019;m stoked to help those that help them.</p>
<p>If you take a look at the Trending page @jdawg has a great post creating a new tag for veterans.  </p>

<p>It brings me great joy to see him thriving because he was one of the first winners of the Minnow Support Project Weekly Resteem.  Now he&#x2019;s trending and he&#x2019;s trending on a post helping build a community!  I couldn&#x2019;t be prouder!!!!  Similar to the other channels we&#x2019;ve created he now has control of a Vets channel in the PALnet Discord room.  I&#x2019;m expecting great things and am so happy to help build a virtual home for the kids coming back from duty and to try to help them reintegrate the best we can.</p>
<h2 id="Music-and-Podcasts"><a href="#Music-and-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="Music and Podcasts "></a>Music and Podcasts </h2><h2></h2><p>Lastly, I&#x2019;m stoked to support @isaria.  She&#x2019;s been posting some wonderful music that&#x2019;s caught some whale attention.  Her and her husband @swelker101 are wonderful influences on the PALnet community.  He&#x2019;s in there every day coordinating with new people and helping her create and spread her music.  She&#x2019;s recording songs that have caught some great attention.  9 days ago they came in as pure minnows without much of a network.  Now they have tons of fans and $300+ posts.</p>
<p>I asked her about what she thought the impact of the Minnow Support Project was and here&#x2019;s what she said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I first joined Steemit I had no idea what I was doing.  The Minnow Support Project was formed about a week after I joined, and I can truly say that I wouldn&#x2019;t have been as successful here had it not been for this support group.  I&#x2019;ve made roughly $1000 in about a month due to the support, suggestions, and friendships in the MSP community.  MSP really solidifies the community aspect of what Steemit is all about and continues to help me find my voice and focus.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see her perform here: <a href="https://steemit.com/openmic/@isaria/open-mic-week-39-swan-swan-hummingbird-r-e-m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/openmic/@isaria/open-mic-week-39-swan-swan-hummingbird-r-e-m</a><br>and here: <a href="https://steemit.com/openmic/@isaria/open-mic-week-38-the-low-spark-of-high-heeled-boys-by-traffic-piano-vocal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/openmic/@isaria/open-mic-week-38-the-low-spark-of-high-heeled-boys-by-traffic-piano-vocal</a></p>
<p>Now they&#x2019;re talking about a podcast from &#x201C;the pond&#x201D; with another PALnet standard @gmuxx.   We&#x2019;re gonna get music, art, and news out to the steemit community from inside the pond and hear from minnows that have come to share their art and stories.</p>
<h2 id="Witness-settings"><a href="#Witness-settings" class="headerlink" title="Witness settings "></a>Witness settings </h2><h2></h2><p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmdpkHECLU6NQ3kvNjtbPCPrqLwYqzHs6nUR7fTGGwX8VB/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can see how my witness is setup here.  I&#x2019;m about 2PV away from being in the top 50, which is a big deal, because it make it about 100 times easier to vote for the person.  I&#x2019;m publishing an unbiased price feed.  I have a low account creation fee. I&#x2019;m rocking HF 19.</p>
<p>I still stand by my concerns that going down to 10 votes is too few.  While it&#x2019;s ok for many people because you have a slide bar for voting power minnows don&#x2019;t.  That means every time they&#x2019;re voting beyond 10 votes a day they&#x2019;re dropping power.  This seems to have slowed the average page views a minnow gets, the number of comments that get voted on, and seems to have curtailed minnow interactions.  I&#x2019;m pretty sure that wasn&#x2019;t the intention.  I&#x2019;d like to see us go up to 20 votes and add a 2x button.  That way Steemians can still get their votes done quickly, but can happen without smushing minnow interaction.  </p>
<p>Some minnows have said the number of votes doesn&#x2019;t matter.  Some minnows have shared that it changes their own behavior towards less interaction, and many have said that it impacts their page views and interactions on their wall negatively.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m still concerned about trending.  It looks like it made the top posters wealthier.  That&#x2019;s not a good thing from the perspective of a guy who spends hours a day tending to minnows.  Sunday&#x2019;s trending looked a little healthier.  We&#x2019;ll have to see how it progresses.</p>
<h2 id="Personal"><a href="#Personal" class="headerlink" title="Personal "></a>Personal </h2><h2></h2><p>You can see me growing on Steemwhales.com.  I like tracking by follower count more than any other metric.  You can see I&#x2019;m ranked the 57th most followed steemian on the site.  It&#x2019;s getting hard to go up too.  Not only do I have to gain more followers, but I have to out pace some amazing authors.  It&#x2019;s tricky.  That said there&#x2019;s some legends in the list that I just passed.  I&#x2019;m really honored to have this much support.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmZcRCpeyXQquX1AqnocpF2hAhUijeX3SVsoKDXSusFPd3/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>About a month ago I had 450 followers.  I&#x2019;m glad I embraced change and have really put myself out there for this place.  It&#x2019;s been really rewarding personally, and now with more power around here there&#x2019;s more I can do to help the folks I work with every day!</p>
<h2 id="Please-help-me-continue-this-work"><a href="#Please-help-me-continue-this-work" class="headerlink" title="Please help me continue this work "></a>Please help me continue this work </h2><h2></h2><p>If you think building a Discord channel with 1300 people in it, supporting Venezuelans specifically and Spanish speakers broadly, helping vets, supporting the arts, and making a vibrant community on and off chain is a good thing to do for Steemit and the world please vote for my witness.  I&#x2019;ve been at this less than a month and can&#x2019;t wait to see what the future brings.  Much love to the whales that support me and the 200+ minnows and dolphins that have my Witness back!</p>
