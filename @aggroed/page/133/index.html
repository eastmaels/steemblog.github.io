<p>I told @crimsonclad that I would delegate 500 SP to contestants on her show as a way to grow the MSPWaves audience.  She has had more peeps on her show than mine and I think it&#x2019;s good for the station to have some distributed prizes for listeners.  She said &#x201C;I have a packed show, so just give it to the mods.&#x201D;  So, thats what I have done.  I&#x2019;ve gone through and added a 100SP delegation to each of the mods or to a bot of their choice.</p>

It airs Sunday night from 9-11pm EST.  It&#x2019;s right after @swelker101 and @isaria go on.  I&#x2019;m travelling and trying to get my mac laptop setup.  If I can get muh tech working then I&#x2019;ll try to have @stellabelle on the show and hang out with her and hear about her recent Steemfest Trip she put together for some minnows!!!</p>
<p>Should be fun!</p>

<p>If you&#x2019;re living under a rock you may not have heard of the Make a Minnow foundation.  It&#x2019;s a great project brought on by one of the MSP moderators @sammosk (the single most active community member in PALnet) with some extra special help and love by @eturnerx.  Frankly all of teamaustralia might have their hands in this&#x2026;  </p>
<p>It&#x2019;s a project whereby the MSP community rents delegation and lifts up 1 minnow to a 10k SP Dolphin for 4 weeks.  It&#x2019;s a way for us to shout out to the stars &#x201C;This Community Stands by the Awesomeness of this Person.  This Community stands in Awe of their great contributions.  This Community offers gratitude for their service.&#x201D;</p>
<h2 id="My-nomination"><a href="#My-nomination" class="headerlink" title="My nomination"></a>My nomination</h2><p>One of the single most important parts of the Minnow Support Project is MSPWaves.  Not only is it a great mouth piece for us, not only is it a technological excellence, not only is it a great draw for Steemit and Crypto, but honestly&#x2026; it&#x2019;s just a shit ton of fun.  While there are several people that can be held up as creating this thing from the DJs that run the shows, the guys who manage it (@ma1neevent, @r0nd0n), the guy with the vision to say &#x201C;hey we should build a radio station,&#x201D; or even some of the audience members like @kubbyelizabeth that make it really fun to participate&#x2026; the guy that really did and does the lion&#x2019;s share is @sircork.</p>
<h2 id="So-I&#x2019;ve-written-one-love-letter-let-this-stand-as-another"><a href="#So-I&#x2019;ve-written-one-love-letter-let-this-stand-as-another" class="headerlink" title="So, I&#x2019;ve written one love letter let this stand as another"></a>So, I&#x2019;ve written one love letter let this stand as another</h2><p>There are a lot of extremely talented, kind, and service oriented people in the MSP community.  There are folks that literally give every waking hour to this place it seems.  If you see a name in blue they don&#x2019;t just think of MSP as a place to chill, but many of us think of it as a digital home.  It&#x2019;s a home because we have friends and family in there that understand our viewpoints, speak kindly to us, support one another on the ups and downs of life, and yes, we help eachother be successful on the block too.</p>
<p>In part because the guy doesn&#x2019;t actually sleep normally and in part because his work is international in scope, and in part because he&#x2019;s quite a talented programmer @sircork has built himself quite the reputation.  While at times that reputation has been a little mixed with sass and spunk of late those days seem long past.  What we have is an incredibly talented and gifted man, who lives in service to delivering the message of thanks and gratitude and doing that primarily through the radio station/mouthpiece that he built from scratch from little more than &#x201C;hey, let&#x2019;s build a radio station.&#x201D;</p>
<h2 id="There-are-many-talented-and-wonderful-minnows-but-today-is-sircork&#x2019;s-day-to-be-my-nomination-for-MaM"><a href="#There-are-many-talented-and-wonderful-minnows-but-today-is-sircork&#x2019;s-day-to-be-my-nomination-for-MaM" class="headerlink" title="There are many talented and wonderful minnows, but today is @sircork&#x2019;s day to be my nomination for MaM"></a>There are many talented and wonderful minnows, but today is @sircork&#x2019;s day to be my nomination for MaM</h2><p>To the pondies.  I hope you know you&#x2019;re loved.  I&#x2019;m filled with gratitude that you spend your time in the home I helped build for all of us.  It&#x2019;s literally one of the best communities I&#x2019;ve ever found and I&#x2019;m daily astounded I helped build it.  Your day will come too.  I know you&#x2019;re working hard and spreading the mission of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty in your own way I&#x2019;ll do my best to support you all.  I&#x2019;ll make sure those of you who kick ass on behalf of this place get a turn in the spotlight.  You deserve nothing less for your hard work.</p>
<p>With love and gratitude to the pond, the mods, the witnesses, and today above all- @sircork; who receives my nomination for MaM.</p>

<p>My promise as a Witness this entire time has been to uphold the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, help bring new members to the platform, and help minnows grow their accounts on the platform.  One of the fastest ways to grow on the platform is to contribute to it with some coding projects, but right now that&#x2019;s basically outside the scope of nearly everyone that joins the platform.  </p>
<p>There appears to be roughly 2-3 dozen devs on the platform outside of the Steemit Inc folk who are highly talented and able to do programming.  There are many others trying to learn and piece this stuff together, but there aren&#x2019;t great resources available.  So, I&#x2019;m gonna work to fix that to help train more block chain devs to code shit for steemit, and as a way to get those who can learn phat stacks of cash and grow from minnow to whale in record time.</p>
<h2 id="Vision"><a href="#Vision" class="headerlink" title="Vision"></a>Vision</h2><p>We need a text/video book to help development on this platform.  I&#x2019;m gonna crowdsource one.  (This will come in later too when we go from Library to University)</p>

I can design a book (but I can&#x2019;t write it).  So, I&#x2019;ll design it and then start paying bounties for all the sub chapters that we&#x2019;re going to cover.  As an author/contributor you&#x2019;ll write your own post, on your own page, with your own youtube/dtube videos added to it, and then we&#x2019;ll archive it.  We&#x2019;re going to archive it with steemshelves.com.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmfUKgQTbpGwbD4gUvxm7qtjXtGeDMyyDiB9Nor3MMXZoR/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This isn&#x2019;t the only book we&#x2019;ll write like this.  There will be others we&#x2019;ll add.  But for now we&#x2019;re focusing on the biggest need which are programming tutorials in multiple languages that interact with the Steemit block.</p>
<h2 id="How-do-bounties-work"><a href="#How-do-bounties-work" class="headerlink" title="How do bounties work?"></a>How do bounties work?</h2><p>I&#x2019;ll announce a bounty on either @aggroed or @minnowsupport.  I&#x2019;ll give a Chapter, a sub topic, a language, and a rough difficulty level to author.  You&#x2019;ll make the post.  If there&#x2019;s more than one submission it turns into a contest for who wrote it best.  If it&#x2019;s just a handful I&#x2019;ll resteem them.  If it&#x2019;s a lot then I&#x2019;ll only choose 1-2 for resteems and either give out the total reward to one author or split the reward to multiple authors.</p>
<h2 id="First-Bounty"><a href="#First-Bounty" class="headerlink" title="First Bounty"></a>First Bounty</h2><p>Before we get to the juicy stuff we&#x2019;re gonna need some introductory posts on several different languages.  So, since basically all of this is going to rest on Linux.  I&#x2019;m starting with write an introductory post to help someone get to know Linux.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tag it with MSPL</li>
<li>This is a &#x201C;Start-Here&#x201D; level difficulty.  Brand spankin&#x2019; new to programming.</li>
<li>Should cover some of the most basic commands.  Should mention getting a Kernal up and running a couple of different ways (your own server, VPS, inside of Windows)</li>
<li>Should have a text section and a video embedded.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, make a post, tag your posts into the comment section.  A week from now I&#x2019;ll announce the winner and payout the bounty.  I&#x2019;ll also work to resteem the things you make as you make them and comment them here.  When your post is done we&#x2019;ll archive the winner(s) on the steemshelves.com website and add future tutorials/chapters there as well.</p>

<p>So, first just want to give a quick shout out to my witness supporters.  Today I hit 1200 Witness votes.  4 months ago I was barely noticed on the platform.  Today I&#x2019;m a top 20 Witness.  If you&#x2019;re a minnow around here wondering if it&#x2019;s possible I feel like pretty good proof that it is.  @slowwalker is the lastest whale to support my campaign and I&#x2019;m very grateful.  It&#x2019;s been basicly a non-stop ride of work and effort since I started the Minnow Support Project a little under three months ago, but it&#x2019;s been insanely rewarding!  I have a ton of people I legit love and respect.  Friends on every continent.  A radioshow, a streaming radio station, an army of community and curation bots, and a a few dozen people that I&#x2019;ve delegated some steem too.  So far it&#x2019;s been a great ride and I&#x2019;m incredibly grateful and continuing to put in many hours each week.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;re also about to get on the Steemit welcome page.  it&#x2019;s a big deal!!!  With signups fixed we&#x2019;re gonna really get a lot of new users, and if they all visit in MSP this place is gonna get YUUGEE.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&#x2019;s not surprising that my 1200 witness votes and my meet your mod post are linked.  The votes follow the work I do for the platform every day.  One of those jobs is spotlighting the moderators that help make MSP an awesome community.  So, I&#x2019;d like to showcase one now!</p>

<p>Funny story.  @discordiant decided one day to prune the list of inactives from the Minnow Support roster.  So, we lost 880 accounts in one day.  I was cranky about it because I literally posted like 2 days prior that we hit 5,000 accounts.  Anyway, once it happened I asked him to do it every week and also write a report of banned, kicked, and muted members for transparency and make a route back in.  He has a post now where he&#x2019;s basically the police blotter for us sharing which asshat is attempting to scam our accounts and how many post-pormoters we&#x2019;ve banned for spamming lion pics in 40 unrelated channels.</p>

<p>Folks, that was an incredibly fun radio show to run tonight!  I&#x2019;m really grateful for the folks that showed up.  We had more than 40 Steemians with us tonight.  Sadly they weren&#x2019;t all concurrent, but we had a ton on the air and in the channel.</p>
<p>I gave away 40 hard earned SBD.  25 SBD went to @juliakponsford.  15 SBD went to @r0nd0n.  Julia is the newest moderator for the Minnow Support Project.  We&#x2019;re glad to have her on board!  Much congrats.  Such win!</p>
<p>We did a delegation.  I&#x2019;m not ashamed to say I&#x2019;m trying to catch @crimsonclad.  Her metal show topped 40 concurrent users on twitch.  I&#x2019;m a wee bit competitive so my plan is to save up the SP from this week from Witnessing and pump it into a big prize pool to give away on the radio show.  So, I think my radio show this time next week will have a 1k delegation tied to it!</p>
<p>I also shared that if anyone is able to get more than 40 concurrent users on their show this coming week I&#x2019;ll delegate 250 SP to the radio show host or to the person of their choice.</p>
<p>During the show I ran a contest to recruit people to the show.  If they shared who recruited them I put them in a drawing for SP delegation.  That was won by @kubbyelizabeth and she chose to share it with @choogirl (Choo was teh person she recruited to the show tonight).  Because she chose to share and I like the attitude I delegated 150 SP to each of them.  @swelker101 kicked in too.  He delegated 50 SP to them both, also because she chose to share her prize!  That&#x2019;s how you game the prisoner&#x2019;s dilemna folks to promote a sharing culture!</p>
<p>I read a poem by @clayboyn- <a href="https://steemit.com/poetry/@clayboyn/passion-original-poetry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/poetry/@clayboyn/passion-original-poetry</a></p>
<p>And we played  a lot of rock and roll!  I love doing this!  Thanks for attending.  THanks for participating.  Thanks for giving music requests.  Thanks for riding the waves!</p>
