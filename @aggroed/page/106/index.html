<p>This may seem like a silly question, but I have a minor ethical dilemna that showed up during a holiday party.   My second daughter went to go eat the GORP (a mix of nuts, raisins, and M&amp;Ms).  Then I noticed that she started mining the gorp for the M&amp;Ms.  My instinct was to say &#x201C;Hey, don&#x2019;t mine those!&#x201D;  It&#x2019;s from years of leading hiking trips and telling the freaking campers to not do that, but now I&#x2019;m wondering what&#x2019;s the common libertarian/anarchist method for dealing with mining gorp, and if you&#x2019;re ready for it let&#x2019;s make it bigger.</p>
<h2 id="Limited-Communal-Resources"><a href="#Limited-Communal-Resources" class="headerlink" title="Limited Communal Resources "></a>Limited Communal Resources </h2><h2></h2><p>What this has turned into within my head is trying to figure out what the range of answers are for figuring out how to allocate limited physical resources.  This isn&#x2019;t a debate about are you allowed to own your pot smoking, heroine injecting, recreational nukes&#x2026; I&#x2019;m trying to limit it to something where there are simply limited resources and it&#x2019;s not really a trade/value thing.</p>
<p>Should I have told my daughter don&#x2019;t mine those?  I&#x2019;m telling her what to do&#x2026; that&#x2019;s not terribly libertarian, but I&#x2019;m also trying to stay somewhat within social norms.  Where&#x2019;s the balance to that?</p>
<p>Who gets to determine how the resources are allocated?  Is it just the first person to start mining them?  Do they then have mining rights to them?  Should I be able to come in and mine in the exact same way?  How&#x2019;s this work?</p>
<h2 id="What-about-something-like-water"><a href="#What-about-something-like-water" class="headerlink" title="What about something like water? "></a>What about something like water? </h2><h2></h2><p>There&#x2019;s a finite amount of fresh water in the world.  There are lots of people that want it.  How does a libertarian allocate it?  Simply price?  Who gets to handle the faucet?  Is anyone guaranteed water?  Does life necessity factor in to this?  How does voluntarysm impact something like life necessities.</p>
<p>IDK, forgive me and my first world Christmas party existential thoughts, but if you have any answers I&#x2019;d like to know.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s Christmas time.  The snow may be falling where you are.  Children are excited for presents.  Parents are nervous about in-laws.

I&#x2019;ll be on tonight at 8pm.  We&#x2019;ll talk with minnows and dolphins alike.  It&#x2019;s an open forum for folks, so you can introduce yourself, read something, perform, introduce a project, give a project update, and just talk about life on the block.  Only thing I ask is that if you have complaints it&#x2019;s better if you describe actions you don&#x2019;t like instead of people or companies you don&#x2019;t like.</p>

<p>So, @davidpakman did an interview with Roger Ver from Bitcoin Cash.  Ver seems like my kinda guy.  From that interview I think he&#x2019;d support the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  He kept repeating a point that did actually stick with me.  So, firstly I think he understands marketing and messaging and second I think he has a point.</p>
<p>The BTC folks are celebrating the high fees and trying to build btc as a store of wealth more than a tradeable token.  I think the store of wealth thing may go over well, but I think the fees are excessive.  Ver described them popping champagne bottles open when the fees overtook the block production costs.  I can&#x2019;t verify that, but it does seem like the community behind btc has been promoting it.</p>
<p>So, I&#x2019;ve had some fears that btc has been taken over by big banking institutions and the first thing that I really see happening is some massive fees&#x2026; that sounds like big banking to me.  Initally I thought BTC was the good guy and BCC might be the bad one, but I think I have to reverse my thinking here.  I barely hold any btc and don&#x2019;t plan on holding much.  I&#x2019;m pretty sure I don&#x2019;t like it as a coin, but that may change as things develop.  Anyway, the point of high reliability, good network speed, and low cost I think will resonate for a lot of folks and a cash/currency model will ultimately play better in the market than an expensive store of value.  </p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s face it the other coins store value too.  They just don&#x2019;t cost you an assload to do it.</p>
<p>So, not that I&#x2019;m into either of those, but I think I&#x2019;m gonna start rooting for BCC.  Also, I&#x2019;m seeing Steem at $3.30 while BTC is at $15.  Either Steem is starting to be more heavily priced based on the price of BTC or the price correlation between btc and Steem may have weakened.  Funky times for sure.</p>
<p>What do you think?  Which do you prefer?  What are your price predictions for the end of 2018 for BTC, BCC, and Steem?</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m by no means a good crypto trader, so don&#x2019;t take this as advice so much as starting a conversation about it.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve spent some of the last two weeks as a liaison between Steem, YouTubers on Steem, and those that aren&#x2019;t here yet.  I&#x2019;ve spent a few hours talking to people and have come up with a few conclusions.</p>
<h2 id="The-YouTube-landscape-is-a-little-bleak-right-now"><a href="#The-YouTube-landscape-is-a-little-bleak-right-now" class="headerlink" title="The YouTube landscape is a little bleak right now "></a>The YouTube landscape is a little bleak right now </h2><h2></h2><p><strong>Competition is fierce</strong><br>If you&#x2019;re not already above 1M subscribers the challenge of getting there seems a lot higher than it was 3-4 years ago.  It seems as though everyone has thought about just being a YouTube star and has attempted this.  As a consequence there&#x2019;s a lot more channels producing a much wider range of content.  It&#x2019;s good for YouTube and it attracts a wider audience, but it&#x2019;s harder to get noticed during that time.</p>
<p><strong>Adpocolypse</strong><br>You can&#x2019;t talk to a person in YouTube land that doesn&#x2019;t seem drastically impacted by YouTube&#x2019;s ongoing changes to their financial policy.  Whether you believe it&#x2019;s a form of censorship or you believe it&#x2019;s just corporate sponsors being very picky the result remains the same: YouTube channels are getting their revenue cut. For the folks making a living this way it&#x2019;s pretty scary to see that their revenue gets cut randomly.</p>
<p><strong>Ad experience of the user</strong><br>Have you tried watching YouTube lately?  It&#x2019;s a fucking cess pool of ads.  Want to watch a video?  Watch this video first.  Enjoyed 3 minutes of your video?  Watch this 8 min video to see the next 4 minutes.  You get the drill.  The user experience of that literally keeps me away, and no it doesn&#x2019;t inspire me to get youtube red.  </p>
<h2 id="Steem-is-getting-there"><a href="#Steem-is-getting-there" class="headerlink" title="Steem is getting there "></a>Steem is getting there </h2><h2></h2><p>So, if you&#x2019;re already at 1M+ subscribers than Steem might not be the best place to grow your listenership or honestly contribute enough money to help you do what you do just yet.  It&#x2019;s a good backup and a good plan, but it wont&#x2019; be your central revenue source.  That&#x2019;s not true for smaller channels though.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re in the sweet spot of 100k-1M then we&#x2019;re at a pretty good fit.  Steem needs more eyeballs so we can grow.  If you&#x2019;re a YouTube Channel operator then you got those!  You need money.  Don&#x2019;t know if you noticed it but Steem at one point hit a $1B market cap.  Peeps in here have money.  So, let&#x2019;s barter our money for your pitching us.</p>
<h2 id="How-does-it-work-for-Channel-Operators"><a href="#How-does-it-work-for-Channel-Operators" class="headerlink" title="How does it work for Channel Operators "></a>How does it work for Channel Operators </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;ll help you.  I&#x2019;ll be your Steem pimp.  I&#x2019;ll pitch your content to some whales.  I&#x2019;ll introduce you on radio shows to this community.  I&#x2019;ll try to get you on panel discussions with big names on the platform to help you grow.  It sucks getting started on Steem, but it helps if I&#x2019;m there.  I&#x2019;m a top 20 witness with 9k followers, and there&#x2019;s a lot of people that think I help this platform and would back you if I&#x2019;m promoting you.</p>
<p>So, that&#x2019;s how we&#x2019;re gonna get you money.  I&#x2019;ll even put in some honorariums of 50-300 steem to bring you on shows and pimp you that way too.  What you need to do though is progressive work towards these things:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>At the end of every video I need you to promote your steem channel to your audience.  When you&#x2019;re saying click here, subscribe here, touch this, hum that way.. you need to also say &#x201C;Here&#x2019;s a link to my Steem profile leave a comment on my page and I&#x2019;ll try to type back to you!&#x201D;</p>
</li>
<li><p>You should be putting your content on Steem.  We want you using dtube, dsound, and dlive as well as the other projects that come here.  We want you to put your content on steem based tools.  Can you use others?  Sure, but we need you doing this if you want attention from this community or help from me.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exclusive to Steem content.  We want you to pull your loyal audience here.  To get the folks that don&#x2019;t want to miss out you need a hook.  Exclusive content can do that.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Interact with fans.  On Youtube you get a viral video and it gets 2000 comments and you dont&#x2019; care about answering people.  Here, especially as a bit of a celebrity you&#x2019;re going to care.  Every comment you make could get you upvotes in addition to your article, story, video, song,  whatever.  So, you have a financial incentive to finally interact with fans.  Your story could get $20.  Your comment to a fan could earn $300.  Won&#x2019;t always be like that, but people will drop upvotes on comments from you!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make a plea, some tutorials, and other videos about crypto in general, and Steem in particular to help them understand how to be here.</p>
</li>
</ol>

But that&#x2019;s ok.  There&#x2019;s a help group for that.  Have you heard of the Minnow Support Group?  I founded this baby.  It&#x2019;s got 6,000+ Steemians in there and it&#x2019;s run by publicly elected witnesses and moderators on the blockchain that can help you and your audience learn the ropes!  This is part of how you can educate your people.  Send them our way we&#x2019;ll straighten&#x2019;em out in no time.  We tend hang out in a Discord group called the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network.  You can join it here: <a href="https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy</a>.  I also just redirected minnowpond.org to there, so that&#x2019;s a little easier to remember.</p>
<h2 id="What-if-I&#x2019;m-just-a-minnow-Does-any-of-this-apply-to-me"><a href="#What-if-I&#x2019;m-just-a-minnow-Does-any-of-this-apply-to-me" class="headerlink" title="What if I&#x2019;m just a minnow?  Does any of this apply to me? "></a>What if I&#x2019;m just a minnow?  Does any of this apply to me? </h2><h2></h2><p>Yes,  I&#x2019;m crowd sourcing sales of Steem as a good home to all the minnows.  I&#x2019;m willing to pay you 50-200 steem if you line up someone with 100k-1M youtube subs to come on the minnow mayor town hall, or any of the youtube forums I&#x2019;m gonna run.  So, yeah.  Minnows can get in on this action too.  Just start bugging people to come to Steem, point them to that discord and tell them to talk to aggroed and if we make it all work out I&#x2019;ll give them and you some Steem.</p>
<p>The forum is my big one.  It&#x2019;s gonna run on January 13th from 11am to 1pm (starts 1600 UTC).  The real payout is to get them there, so that&#x2019;s you&#x2019;re ultimate goal.</p>
<h2 id="This-is-part-of-my-witness-goals"><a href="#This-is-part-of-my-witness-goals" class="headerlink" title="This is part of my witness goals "></a>This is part of my witness goals </h2><h2></h2><p>The Charter of the Minnow Support Project is to Spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, grow the Steem ecosystem, and train and retain minnows on the platform.  Bringing YouTube Channels here helps with growing the Steem ecosystem and the help I&#x2019;m offering them should help train and retain them and their audience.  This is the work I&#x2019;m doing for the platform right now to pour some gasoline on the Steem fire.  Please vote my witness if you think this will help.</p>
