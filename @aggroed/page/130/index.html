<p>I wrote a post two months ago called the &#x201C;Steemit Broken Hearts Club.&#x201D;  After that I was able to have @stellabelle on my mspwaves radio show with me.  She helped share a distinction of users with me that instantly clicked when I heard it.  </p>
<h2 id="There-are-two-types-of-Steemians"><a href="#There-are-two-types-of-Steemians" class="headerlink" title="There are two types of Steemians "></a>There are two types of Steemians </h2><h2></h2><p>The first type of Steemian is someone who found Steemit on their own after a long journey to get here.</p>
<p>The second type of Steemian is someone who found Steemit because a friend told them to join.</p>
<h2 id="The-Earth-is-broken"><a href="#The-Earth-is-broken" class="headerlink" title="The Earth is broken "></a>The Earth is broken </h2><h2></h2><p>I happen to believe a number of controversial theories regarding why the world works the way it does, but the score board doesn&#x2019;t lie.  Just by the public numbers that are known there are eight people in the world have as much wealth as over 3 billion people.  The world is constantly at war and under threat of nuclear war seemingly all the time.  Draconian laws have been implemented allowing a massive global surveillance network that spies on your computer, home, social life, and seemingly knows every minute detail of your life.  The confluence of these things, especially the monetary system induced poverty, creates a scarcity mentality, which is further hyped with round the clock media showing violence and suffering.</p>
<h2 id="A-partial-recap-of-my-story"><a href="#A-partial-recap-of-my-story" class="headerlink" title="A partial recap of my story "></a>A partial recap of my story </h2><h2></h2><p>My short hand assessment, other than some really lovely people I&#x2019;ve met or created, is that this whole planet is broken, harmful, and wickedly violent.  Somedays I wonder if this is a literal hell.</p>
<p>Now, the consequence of this having to do with Steemit is two fold.  I remember in my awakening journey there are two deep spells of depression.  The first was after 20-30 years of living under one set of beliefs about how the world works and learning the hard way that the world doesn&#x2019;t work the way I thought it did.  In my case, and from my sense of things of how it works for others, it starts losing a lot of money.  I started a business based on some expectations of the world, government, and environment.  What should have been a no brainer failed miserably by the very state I was trusting.  I lost a lot of money, but also because of that I had to go searching as to how after paying such close attention to the media, officials, and things that were around me that I could have possibly been wrong.</p>
<p>Mark Twain said &#x201C;It&#x2019;s easier to fool a man than to convince them they&#x2019;ve been fooled.&#x201D;  So, I  embarked on a multi-year pretty depressing journey to figure out how my smart brain could have possibly been so terribly deceived by this system.  So, the first major depression on this journey was really about seeking how could I have been so wrong, and working my way through all that I was taught and paid attention to was just thoroughly false.  </p>
<p>So, finding out I was wrong about the world, particularly about the role of this current government as a benevolent force for good in the world was bad and hard.  It was pale in comparison to the multi year epic journey trying to figure out how this place actually works.  Learning about the Federal Reserve and the system that&#x2019;s guarenteed to enforce and cause poverty.  Learning about the massive harm pharmacuetical companies cause.  Forcing myself to realize that 2 planes can&#x2019;t collapse 3 buildings at free fall speeds directly into their own footprint  on the same day.  Then working my way back through history to determine other Orwellian historic falsehoods of epic magnitude.  And finally coming to accept that the world is quite literally run by horrible immoral banker criminals and that the scoreboard I was seeing was a direct purposeful result of that.</p>
<p>So, there are two major depressions in my life.  Each lasted years.  Tack into that the death of my mom, challenges caused by drinking for a while, some failed romances, and difficulty with some jobs and you get a picture of some hardship here.</p>
<p>So, I can share that finding my way to Steemit really took years of journeys, multiple depressions, and a shit ton of hard work  to get here.</p>
<h2 id="I-think-basically-all-category-1-Steemians-have-something-like-that"><a href="#I-think-basically-all-category-1-Steemians-have-something-like-that" class="headerlink" title="I think basically all category 1 Steemians have something like that "></a>I think basically all category 1 Steemians have something like that </h2><h2></h2><p>After multiple months of interacting with Steemians of all types in Discord (we&#x2019;ve got about 5,000 of them in PALnet) I&#x2019;ve come to the conclusion that we&#x2019;re a group of mostly broken people doing the best we can to survive, find community, find acceptance, find love, and find purpose.  There&#x2019;s so much emotional, personal, social, and interpersonal dysfunction it&#x2019;s staggering.  We are certainly carving out a digital home, and for many thats at the expense of a terrestrial one.</p>
<h2 id="&#x201C;Yeah-ok-but-what-do-I-do-with-that-aggroed-&#x201D;"><a href="#&#x201C;Yeah-ok-but-what-do-I-do-with-that-aggroed-&#x201D;" class="headerlink" title="&#x201C;Yeah, ok, but what do I do with that @aggroed?&#x201D; "></a>&#x201C;Yeah, ok, but what do I do with that @aggroed?&#x201D; </h2><h2></h2><p>The plan doesn&#x2019;t change, the course doesn&#x2019;t change, the mantra doesn&#x2019;t change.  But we have to learn to integrate it in new ways.</p>
<p>The tack we are sailing is Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.</p>
<p>Those aren&#x2019;t just nouns they are verbs.  They have to be practiced and executed on.  The truly hard part is that you don&#x2019;t just apply those outward.  You have to apply them inwards too.  You have to make peace with yourself.  You have to give yourself freedom to both experience what you have and still love and forgive yourself for it.  You have to alllow yourself an abundance.  Hopefully it comes financially too, but you have to allow yourself an abundance of joy, of love, of kindness, of gratitude, and of a worthy life.</p>
<p>That often comes with the mantra of deescalation.  These things are hard.  Not only do you have to try to deescalate conflicts between you and others, but you have to deescalate conflicts internally as well.  You have to pull back the language that you are using to describe yourself and others with an intention of self love, outward love, and forgiveness all around.  Forgiveness, doesn&#x2019;t need blindly accepting bad shit being done to you especially as it&#x2019;s on going.  You have the right of non-consent for the things that aren&#x2019;t ok, but remember that we&#x2019;re all flawed, fucked up people here (except maybe you category 2 folks&#x2026;), and we&#x2019;re all struggling to figure out a way to live on this planet, with each other, and most difficult of all; with ourselves.</p>
<h2 id="So-here&#x2019;s-my-Friday-advice"><a href="#So-here&#x2019;s-my-Friday-advice" class="headerlink" title="So, here&#x2019;s my Friday advice "></a>So, here&#x2019;s my Friday advice </h2><h2></h2><p>Take a deep breath.  Realize that even with your flaws you are a person worthy of love, kindness, and friendship.  Try to practice a few acts of everyday kindness and express everyday gratitude.  </p>
<p>Chin up.  It&#x2019;s hard, but changing the world is like that.  I honor you, I respect you, and I love you for trying.  I forgive you when you fail.  And for the exceptionally hard I honor me, I respect me, I love me for the work that I do.  I forgive me when I fail, and I know I&#x2019;m doing my best to learn and grow and make this place a better world than the one I found.</p>
<p>Relax, smile, and just in your head pick a random person and think &#x201C;I hope they have a great day today.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I like MaM.  I feel like it has a shot to be one of the best brands of the Minnow Support Project.  I&#x2019;ve considered a number of people for the nomination.  @clayboyn is hilarious and keep me laughing all day.  @torico is chilllin&#x2019; as a bad puppy for hours with the MSP crew.  @choogirl is a contest winning rockstar.  @creativesoul is a talented writer and very tender heart.  There&#x2019;s a boatload of Fictioners worth heaping praise on.</p>
<p>This week I want to acknowledge quite possibly the sweetest person on the platform.  I feel good whenever she&#x2019;s in our Discord.  You know some flower and heart emojis are comin&#x2019; your way.  I know that seems simple, but it&#x2019;s just the every day kindness towards people that makes me think she&#x2019;s one of the brightest lights we have in here.  She strikes me as patient, kind, and caring.  Who wouldn&#x2019;t want more people like that around.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m talking about @wandrnrose7.  She&#x2019;s great and I look forward to seeing her when I get to.  So, out of many wonderful folks to choose from this week I nominate her.</p>

<p>If you&#x2019;ve been on Steemit for a while you&#x2019;ve probably been to the Steemspeak channel that @fyrstikken manages.  If you&#x2019;ve been there you have probably seen a bunch of people in Discord with names like Billy [INTJ}.  The letters are a personality classification system called Myers Briggs.  I have liked that system for a while.  I&#x2019;m an ENTP; the Inventor.  Actually, it&#x2019;s only 1-2% of the population, but it seems like they are everywhere on Steemit and makes me feel a little less like an alien on this planet.</p>
<h2 id="Myers-Briggs-the-good"><a href="#Myers-Briggs-the-good" class="headerlink" title="Myers Briggs, the good "></a>Myers Briggs, the good </h2><h2></h2><p>I like the system, and I think it does a nicce job putting people in some rough buckets according to how they are likely to behave.  It&#x2019;s useful when trying to predict people&#x2019;s actions.  I lie these classication systems, but one of the things it&#x2019;s missing is &#x201C;When an ENTP is healthy they tend to do X, and when they are unhealthy they tend towards Y.&#x201D;  Shit like that can be helful to guide people in their lives and use some general guidelines to track their development.  </p>
<h2 id="Enneagram"><a href="#Enneagram" class="headerlink" title="Enneagram "></a>Enneagram </h2><h2></h2><p>This baby has a pretty good chart and system for personality clarification.  I&#x2019;m an 8.  If you read about them you may not be surprised by it.  I feel it&#x2019;s done a good job describing me for a while, but it also gives me something to aspire to.  8s tend towards 2s when they are at their best.  They give freely and work to help and promote others.  That sound familiar at all?  Anyway, its not a thing I reference daily on myself, but it is something I like to pay attention to every now and again.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s a good page to source stuff.  <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/how-the-enneagram-system-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/how-the-enneagram-system-works/</a>  Some pages and books will specificially talk about relationships between people and how playing off another will bring out our best and worst and what to look for in that regard.</p>
<p>Anyway, thoughts on how to grow as a person or help the peeps in my digital homestead grow is nearly always on my mind, so I thought I&#x2019;d share this gem and trust the universe to deliver it to the right people that may need it right now to guide them.</p>

<p>So, as a top 20 witness I make a few hundred steem (as steem power) a day.  All of the people in the top 20 do.  A block is witnessed every three seconds, and in rotation all the top Witnesses will witness a block nearly once a minute.  It will release ~0.2 steem as steem power when we do.  In a day I&#x2019;ll witness ~1400 blocks and that will release under 280 steem power a day.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve been building up my steempower since I&#x2019;ve been here.  I plan to keep doing that.  I have a full time job so I have other avenues of income so I don&#x2019;t have to power down.  So, my plan is to keep building steempower, which not only helps through delegation, but if you didn&#x2019;t know; Witness voting ignores delegation.  So, when I vote for minnow witnesses to help get their campaigns started I&#x2019;m able to get give them my full vote even though I delegate 95%+ of my steem power most of the time.</p>
<p>So, what do I do with my Steem Power?  I delegate it away.  I use post rewards to pay my server fees and costs.  I use my sp for delegations, and I focus on getting communities started.  A great way to get them going is to use the tools we have in the Minnow Support Project.  @netuoso built msp3k.com and won a MSP Medal of Honor for it.  It&#x2019;s a program that stores private posting keys in a hidden way, which allows many people to have access to upvote and resteem.  So, this week I&#x2019;ve gotten a few off the ground and supported others.</p>
<h2 id="New-Communities"><a href="#New-Communities" class="headerlink" title="New Communities "></a>New Communities </h2><h2></h2><p>@msp-canada<br>@msp-turkey</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m stoked to say both of these groups are off the ground.  Both have 6-10 people curating them.  There&#x2019;s around 1,000 SP on both accounts, which isn&#x2019;t bad for the first week.  It&#x2019;s nice to see how how quickly these things can get started!  I delegated to each as a starting point so its more likely folks will kick in on their own too. I like how when people feel ownership they are more likely to delegate and build together. I think a community account like this can be the centerpiece of steem based communities.</p>
<h2 id="Helping-Existing-Communities"><a href="#Helping-Existing-Communities" class="headerlink" title="Helping Existing Communities "></a>Helping Existing Communities </h2><h2></h2><p>@mrsquiggle<br>@msp-lovebot</p>
<p>Squiggle is the #teamaustralia community.  They were doing great having a centralized curation by @scooter77.  But he was quick to think it&#x2019;s cool af to make it community based.  We added 6+curators to help find good content and get it exposure and votes.  Hopefully the increased engagement and ownership leads to a strong community account and internal collaboration.</p>
<p>@msp-lovebot is muh personal baby and I created it to support the people that help MSP run.  I like to resteem content that I like. I like to vote people that I like.  In some way after I have picked them or they have picked me I don&#x2019;t really care what they are posting.  I&#x2019;m going to suppoet it (as long as it&#x2019;s in line with PAL).  So, my big delegation this week was 1,000SP onto msp-lovebot bringing my total delegation there to 9000 SP!  This way I can literally help everyone that&#x2019;s helping MSP.  Currently, it&#x2019;s my favorite community bot to support.</p>
<h2 id="Technical-Highlights"><a href="#Technical-Highlights" class="headerlink" title="Technical Highlights "></a>Technical Highlights </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;ve switched to 19.2.  Here&#x2019;s hoping it can actually help Polo suck less.  I&#x2019;m still at 1 missed block.  I don&#x2019;t have any interest put in place for SBD (0.01%).  I think it&#x2019;ll only help polo and bittrex and the price is actually pretty stable on Bittrex around $1, so I don&#x2019;t think it needs it.</p>
<p>The Minnow Support Project has 4500+ people in Discord, 5,000 followers on Steemit.  70k+ Steem Power on the main account.  Over 500 delegators supplying over 150k SP to all of our projects.  We have 3 Witnesses that have reached teh top 20 after their involvement, and about 12 total who support, manage, delegate, or are just getting started out of &#x201C;The Pond.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Oh, and in case you missed it we&#x2019;re Steemit Official.  @timcliff put in the accepted pull request that points the New Member Support Group to the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network, which is home to the Minnow Support Project.  So, kudos to us, not bad considering we&#x2019;ve only existed as a team for around 4 months.</p>

<p>All the mods are wonderful.  I feel blessed to have them all here.   They are smart.  They are passionate.  They live to serve.  Cork is no different in those regards, but he exemplifies and plays off the things that I love so well.  I feel a great camraderie with the whole crew, but Cork keeps me sane and laughing.  He has his tragic moments when he&#x2019;s crying on the radio, he has his hilarious moments when he communicates sassily primarily through memes (Stemes), and he has his work ethic moments when he&#x2019;s going through his 2nd 24 hr wakeful period in a row where he has been coding, onboarding DJs, calling India buisness partners, and talking a million minnows off a Steemit cliff.  He&#x2019;s like the brother I didn&#x2019;t know I had.</p>
<p>He built one of my favorite things in the world: mspwaves streaming radio station and won a MSP Medal of Honor for it.</p>
<p>You know him, you love him, he&#x2019;s a brother from another mother.  It&#x2019;s @sircork.</p>
<p>When did you hear about the MSP?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@sircork- &#x201C;I joined steemit on Jun 12, 2017 and learned about PAL/MSP via some random post in my feed and joined it on June 19th, 2017&#x201D;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why did you join the MSP?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@sircork- Because I wanted to meet and talk to people and be even more immersed in the steem/steemit world and because steemit.chat is written on the worst chat engine in the entire world and I can&#x2019;t stand even opening a tab to it, it just feels &#x201C;dirty&#x201D; and gross over there. Discord is so much more functional and I was quite familiar with it long before steemit. So I came for the real time chat. I stayed for the family I found here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you think is the best aspect of the MSP?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@sircork-  That it is a real time community to support the time shifted nature of the steemit.com platform. It&#x2019;s no fun to exist in a vaccuum answering and responding to replies in a time lagging way via comments. It&#x2019;s much more fun to co-habitate on the platform in real time, in a lively communal setting. It&#x2019;s difference between sharing a public park with strangers via notes left on park benches and a full blown picnic with all your friends there at the same time!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You&#x2019;re a moderator what does that mean to you?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@sircork- It means that I am now in a position of accountability and have been given some responsibilties which coincide with my love of this home we have online here and our need to do chores around it to keep it clean, maintained and operating smoothly. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What&#x2019;s your service project?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@sircork- I have several I&#x2019;m involved in and one Im fully committed to. That would be the operation of MSP Waves Radio, which I visualize and imagine as the multimedia branch of the PAL/MSP organization. Our mission statement is a bit long, but it genuinally boils down to &#x201C;Always help others however possible&#x201D; and we do, via tech teaching and self improvement topics, providing information, exposure for interesting and worthy community citizens, and just plain old entertainment. Always be enriching others on some level. Thats the service we try to provide and what I spend my entire days focused on now. I&#x2019;m also a block chain witness and of course, I consider modding itself, to be a service project of the highest order as well!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How much time do you spend on MSP stuff?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@sircork- 15-24 hours per day, no exaggeration, no lie. I fit my offline company in around it, not the other way around.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why does it matter to you so much?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@sircork-  &#x201C;Because I have very little family in the &#x201C;&#x201D;real world&#x201D;&#x201D; left and what is left is kind of broken. A lot. So this is my family. And it&#x2019;s real, raw and personal for me here. I don&#x2019;t want to elaborate on this much more, but suffice it to say this place, it fills a lot of holes in my life and in my heart, the people here, are the best and brightest in the world. I am honored to be accepted here, and to call this place my home and you all my family, both ultra close and distant cousin extended, and some ive not even met, just like a real family, because you are my real family now.</p>
<p>The complementary reason is that I was already on a trajectory to devote my life to service and &#x201C;&#x201D;charity&#x201D;&#x201D; mission type work already before I ever found steemit or steem or MSP and PAL, and it was just such a natural fit for me and my style of service, to provide a platform for one on one work across the big old dirty rock we humans live on together, that I got here and can&#x2019;t imagine where else me and my limited resources could be more effective.&#x201D;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need some channel mods, why should people do it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@sircork- Recognition, empowerment, distribution of organization-wide chores, contribution to the organization, giving back what was freely given to them when they arrived. I think it&#x2019;s a stepping stone to greater contributions and an excellent position to see opportunities from, a higher ground to lead to move giving and contributing. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What excites you about Steemit?</p>

<p>@sircork-Literally nearly everything about it. But first and foremost, how it has enabled ME with little personal resources, to facilitate changes in lives, of spiritual, mental, philosophical and financial natures. I live to serve, and the feedback I&#x2019;m getting fuels my passion for service. One person can truly help another here. In any number of ways or definitions of the word &#x201C;help&#x201D; and to any number of end goals. We can be one person on steemit and change the world, for someone or some group. The platform provides the means, we provide the ways. For each other. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What&#x2019;s a long term vision for where Steemit is going?and how do you fit into that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@sircork- I think its going to continue on it&#x2019;s current curve, adopting the kind of people who can take in the 1000 things you need to understand to use it effectively and it will probably never become a &#x201C;facebook&#x201D; killer, as I don&#x2019;t believe that is it&#x2019;s intent or best use at all anyway. So I suspect it will continue exactly like it does now, adding a couple thousand users per day and the long tail is more like a Quora.com with financial incentives in it. A strong, vibrant web community with cultures from all over the world transcending the barriars that keep us all separate on earth, again both physical and metaphorical, as well as tangible and intangible. I will be here fitting in wherever I can lend a hand, a dollar or a bit of advice or a listening ear. Whatever it takes, this is my whole world now, and I will just try to be a kind, caring, concerned citizen in it, doing what I can, wherever I can, whenever I can, to help my fellow citizens get along in it and thrive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What can MSP be doing better?  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>@sircork- Better planning and governance over &#x201C;offical MSP projects/contents/prizes/equalization&#x201D; perhaps, in that sense I am feeling the core team members each sort of each do their own thing individually but we could be more cohesive in what we both do, allow and interoperate on, but beynod that knee jerk thought, I haven&#x2019;t really given that much more thought. Really we do pretty well for an evolving multi-thousand member group. I think that the biggest issue I see is that we have 5000 minnows, and 50 core chat users. Thats a big gap. (also not accurate numbers, more of a generalization for effect) - so somewhere between 500 people who make full use of the community and 4500 who just come for the bots, we have an opportunity to achieve more community and less gathered up individuals. If that makes any sense. When you join a large group, it&#x2019;s a good idea to find a buddy. Maybe there is some way to match older minnows with spanky new ones in a sponsor/buddy system idea. Eventually after a period, a minnow adopts the next new one, and these &#x201C;downlines&#x2019; of mentorship just perpetuate, strengthening individual bonds but also unilaterally rising the tides for all our ships.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can minnows contribute to the system and grow their accounts?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@sircork- &#x201C;I view these as mutually exclusive and don&#x2019;t really think they belong in the same question. </p>
<p>You can grow your account 100x ways. Bottom line? Make good content and get it visible via communities you build yourself into via comments and chat rooms.</p>
<p>How can you contribute? Find a project to support or create one? What can you offer to help serve the community? Is it advice, tech, software, tools, insights, some kind of useful skill you can provide or teach? Is it just money you can help someone with somehow? Is it a helpful, educational or uplifting and entertaining voice on a radio show? Is it art that people can appreciate like images or music? Is it just an ear when someone needs it?</p>
<p>How can you focus on kindness, generosity, gratitude, patience, teamwork and contributing, to acheive peace, abundance and liberty for yourself, while assisting others to join you in acheiving these goals? That&#x2019;s what you should be doing.&#x201D;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What else would you want to share here?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@sircork- &#x201C;Listen to the radio! Spread the word about it.<br>Practice the principles, acheive the goals!<br>It works if you work it. Do the work.<br>Don&#x2019;t do it alone. Join communities.<br>Teem work makes the steem dream work.<br>Let me know how I can help! Let me know if I appear to need some help too. I can&#x2019;t always slow down enough to see my forest through my own trees. I&#x2019;m listening! Always! See you in the steem!&#x201D;</p>
