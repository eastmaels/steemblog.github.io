<p>Our focus this week was conflict resolution and we used the heated topic of bid bots to provide examples of ineffective and effective methods of resolving conflict.</p>
<h1 id="Show-Highlights"><a href="#Show-Highlights" class="headerlink" title=" Show Highlights  "></a><center> Show Highlights  </center></h1><ul>
<li>Aggroed explained how Hardfork 19 led to the rise of bid bots.</li>
<li>We discussed the pros and cons of bid bots.</li>
<li>We had some mock conversations that provided examples of both unproductive and effective forms of heated discourse.</li>
<li>We discussed the best methods for conflict resolution.</li>
<li>We did our best to trigger @isaria, @swelker101, and even @kubbyelizabeth.  You&#x2019;ll laugh :)</li>

<p>BOOM!  7K!  That&#x2019;s a big deal!  Steemwhales hasn&#x2019;t been updated recently so it&#x2019;s harder to know where that stands in the lineup, but last I checked if you removed all the bots that run around upvoting brand new users or take out the guys that have 90k followers and 9k who follow them because of 4f4 then I was in the top 30 most followed accounts on the platform (with them I was still like top 60).</p>
<h2 id="I-work-my-ass-off"><a href="#I-work-my-ass-off" class="headerlink" title="I work my ass off "></a>I work my ass off </h2><h2></h2><p>In my terrestial world I&#x2019;m a father of two, have a dog that likes to shit on rugs, I have a wife, and a full time job.  In that full time job I&#x2019;ve been hiring and now I&#x2019;m up to a team of five.  I have a 1hr+ commute into the city every day.  I get home, eat my dinner, play with my kids a bit, put them to bed, and go back to my second full time job of running MSP and acting like a witness.</p>
<p>Most recently this takes the form of a running a radio show and getting a youtuber with 400k subscribers to talk about Steem on their show (thanks @davidpakman), I&#x2019;m going to interview @michaelvenompage who is a UFC fighter turned Steem blogger on Friday, I&#x2019;m hosting Boston meetup this Saturday, I&#x2019;ll have a Bid Bot owners meeting after that, some time with my brother for his birthday, and then come home and do an mspwaves show.  Sunday I&#x2019;ll have some time to post and chat, and then run another 3-4hrs of radio.</p>
<p>My alone time consists of shitting and showering.  Frankly, I wouldn&#x2019;t have it any other way.  I love what I&#x2019;m doing and I love the movement that I&#x2019;m working on (political less so the bowel).</p>
<h2 id="I&#x2019;m-knocking-on-the-door-of-2-5k-witness-votes"><a href="#I&#x2019;m-knocking-on-the-door-of-2-5k-witness-votes" class="headerlink" title="I&#x2019;m knocking on the door of 2.5k witness votes "></a>I&#x2019;m knocking on the door of 2.5k witness votes </h2><h2></h2><p>People trust that I&#x2019;m working hard to help and grow this platform.  I get a lot of witness votes because of it and I consider myself intensely lucky to be back in the top 10.  This gig is nothing short of ball sweat and tears.  My witness mentor @timcliff told me that this job was a round the clock gig.  I was thinking he was talking about running the server, but what I didn&#x2019;t realize is that he was really talking about working around the clock with people.  People need help, people have problems, people need to network, people need stuff.  It&#x2019;s our job to help them find it.</p>
<h2 id="You&#x2019;re-tired-of-this-story-but-idc"><a href="#You&#x2019;re-tired-of-this-story-but-idc" class="headerlink" title="You&#x2019;re tired of this story but idc "></a>You&#x2019;re tired of this story but idc </h2><h2></h2><p>I wouldn&#x2019;t have this start if @kaylinart and @fyrstikken didn&#x2019;t give me a push and a helping hand.  I wouldn&#x2019;t be here without the cofounders of PALnet (@ausbitbank, @teamsteem, @canadian-coconut).  I wouldn&#x2019;t be here without an extraordiary group of witnesses and moderators that help run PALnet.  I was really stoked to see more than half of the people on @stellabelle&#x2019;s list of folks to delegate to grew up in the Minnow Support Project.  I feel like our call to service mission is helping to elevate some of the highest quality people on the platform.  I couldn&#x2019;t be prouder of my team, my friends, and my digital family.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#x2019;t get this far without the witness voters that stand behind me.  Thank you!</p>

Thanks for lifting me up, thanks for supporting me, I&#x2019;m sorry if I ever let you down, and know I&#x2019;m trying to do well by this place and our people.</p>

<p>Bid Bots are a hot topic these days.  Opinions range from beneficial to investors to reward pool raping bastards.  It&#x2019;s a little hot and heated.  I wanted to bring together bid bot owners into a public forum.  <del>Other shows are happening at that time so it won&#x2019;t be broadcast on mspwaves</del> We are free to broadcast this on mspwaves and will be doing so.  We&#x2019;ll all join up within PALnet in a Discord Live on Air channel.  </p>
<p>The public is welcome to attend, but the majority of voice conversation will be limited to bid bot owners.  I&#x2019;ll record the conversation and post it so the public can see this isn&#x2019;t a bunch of rich bastards smoking cigars in a black room trying to cheat minnows and instead it&#x2019;s a group of concerned business owners trying to provide a valuable service in an ethical and profitable way.</p>
<p>Topics include:</p>
<p>Ethical bid bot operations<br>black lists<br>white lists<br>expectation setting<br>best practice<br>abuse prevention<br>steemcleaners alignment<br>PAlnet/MSP blacklist alignment</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m going to start experimenting with upvoting my posts (not comments) with a bid bot at the 5-6 day mark.  I&#x2019;m doing this for a variety of reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#x2019;m not a shitposter (no matter how many times @acidyo says I am)</li>
<li>I want to reward investors for buying and holding onto Steem</li>
<li>I want to support my curators by waiting until all those interested parties have been gathered and then use the bid bot to curate them back ( I can&#x2019;t right meow &#x2018;cause I delegate muh Steem power)</li>
<li>I want to make it harder for shit posters to earn using bid bots by providing competition for purchased votes</li>
<li>I like steem and want moar</li>

I aim to at least not overshoot the $1/view thresh hold.</p>

I&#x2019;m doing this at the end of a post payout cycle where a ton of rewards are shared.  It&#x2019;s an experiment.  Let&#x2019;s see how she goes.</p>
<h2 id="&#x201C;Aggroed-you&#x2019;re-raping-the-pool-&#x201D;"><a href="#&#x201C;Aggroed-you&#x2019;re-raping-the-pool-&#x201D;" class="headerlink" title="&#x201C;Aggroed, you&#x2019;re raping the pool.&#x201D; "></a>&#x201C;Aggroed, you&#x2019;re raping the pool.&#x201D; </h2><h2></h2><p>Well, tough to say, bidbots represent about 5-6 million SP.  That&#x2019;s somewhere around 2% of the total pool.  If you think that 2% of the pool going back to relatively passive investors is rewardpoolrape then I suppose we&#x2019;ll see some epic flagging here (&#x201C;because that will bring new users here for sure&#x201D; he says sarcastically).  I suppose there&#x2019;s more stuck into @minnowbooster and the folks they work with, but we&#x2019;re still talking about single digit percents.</p>
<h2 id="&#x201C;Aggroed-everything-about-linear-rewards-is-horrible-how-can-you-support-any-of-this"><a href="#&#x201C;Aggroed-everything-about-linear-rewards-is-horrible-how-can-you-support-any-of-this" class="headerlink" title="&#x201C;Aggroed, everything about linear rewards is horrible, how can you support any of this? "></a>&#x201C;Aggroed, everything about linear rewards is horrible, how can you support any of this? </h2><h2></h2><p>The better solution is to fix distribution and then go back to quadratic or exponential rewards when they can function better.  Right now more than 93% of the steem is in the hands of 1% of the accounts (excluding @steemit)  What we really ought to do is make platform inflation a witness variable and then I&#x2019;d advocate we keep it at 10% for a while assuming we&#x2019;re growing.  Stake weighted inflation is bad because it&#x2019;ll eff over distribution even more, but platform inflation through content creation and curation helps this place grow and spread the wealth beyond the top 1%.</p>
<p>Until then, we&#x2019;re in linear rewards, and instead of complaining about it I&#x2019;d rather just do the best with the system I have and support my posts and my curators as a start and then look into ways to automate some select vote bot usage for minnows in the pond on the platform.</p>

<p>This coming Saturday I&#x2019;m going to switch  my witness vote from my previous picks and start proxying to @minnowsupport.  The witnesses and moderators who operate The Minnow Support Project are going to vote on applications on a monthly basis to figure out who they are going to vote for.  So, this post serves both as a second notice of the change and my application to be approved for a witness vote by @minnowsupport.</p>
<h2 id="My-History"><a href="#My-History" class="headerlink" title="My History "></a>My History </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;ve been on this platform for over a year.  I spent the first 8 months or so posting somewhat infrequently and not being an altogether helpful Steemian.  I didn&#x2019;t really understand the benefits that can come from a platform like this or how it could be transformational.  At one point my writing on the block wasn&#x2019;t very good and I admitted that to myself so I went looking for a high quality author to emulate.  I picked @kaylinart.  I wrote an article about how she formatted her posts and she was kind enough to resteem it.  @fyrstikken was also kind enough to resteem it and from just those two resteems I was about to basically double my follower count over night.</p>
<p>It also changed my perspective of this place.  They were able to help me greatly.  They of course have put in considerable time and effort to grow their accounts, but in terms of helping me it cost them nothing to click resteem and it launched my path on this platform.  Because of how quickly that helped me grow I realized that Steemit can help people at practically no personal cost to themselves.  Suddenly it clicked, I fell in love with the Platform, and realized it&#x2019;s potential to create a system of abundance and generosity.</p>
<p>My next step was to launch a weekly resteem contest as a way to give back.  I wanted to help other people grow on the platform, and I knew that visibility was one of the top priorities.  I started it on @aggroed, but I starting getting frustrated that it was taking up too many of my posts.  So I used anon.steem.network and I created @minnowsupport as an alt.</p>
<p>I also saw the power of combining discord with Steem having started to hang out in SteemSpeak.  So, I said look, I have these values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty and I want to connect with other like minded folks so I built my own server.  I shared a post about what we were doing on the block and I also hosted a Discord meetup.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcsf4u8pRCo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcsf4u8pRCo</a></p>
<p>Because of a post and some kind heartedness @benjojo was crazy enough to delegate 75,000 SP to the project.  I worked with @inertia to modify his @banjo bot and linked @minnowsupport to a bot in Discord.  Now I had a way to help every single person on the chain get a small vote.  To the whales they tend to avoid it, but to the minnows it&#x2019;s a lifesaver.</p>
<h2 id="Witness"><a href="#Witness" class="headerlink" title="Witness "></a>Witness </h2><h2></h2><p>I started a witness campaign because I wanted to be a bigger part of this platform and spread this message.  I new I needed resources to do it.  I got a ton of help from @someguy123 and got a server up and running.  I&#x2019;ve made two main promises.  1.  I&#x2019;ll be a better witness than all the dead witnesses above me.  2.  I&#x2019;ll support what ultimately became the public charter of the Minnow Support Project; to spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, help Steem grow, and help train and retain minnows on the platform.  I&#x2019;m proud of myself that I haven&#x2019;t wavered from those in the slightest.</p>
<h2 id="PALnet-exploded"><a href="#PALnet-exploded" class="headerlink" title="PALnet exploded "></a>PALnet exploded </h2><h2></h2><p>Between the bot, the values, the community, and the service mission we exploded.  We got up to a 100 people in a few days.  We got up to a 1000 within a month.  We got up to 5000 after a few months.  We started pruning inactive members and went down to 4,000, and now we&#x2019;re back up to 5,000+ active members.  We have hundreds of people in the channel, we have thousands on the server.  We have a round the clock witness and mod team.  </p>
<p>It&#x2019;s an exceptional amount of work.  Posting and pushing projects are two big parts of it, but it&#x2019;s really people management.  I&#x2019;m blessed because we don&#x2019;t have that much conflict, but it&#x2019;s there.  I spend a ton of my time deescalating it and trying to help people learn a different way.  I spend about 20-40 hours a week doing Steem related things.  I&#x2019;d say 1/2 of any week&#x2019;s activities are straight up people management.  </p>

<h2 id="mspwaves"><a href="#mspwaves" class="headerlink" title="mspwaves "></a>mspwaves </h2><h2></h2><p>I was a college DJ and I loved it.  I had the idea that we needed to not just do a podcast, but to have a full internet streaming media station.  I worked with some extremely talented people to make it happen, and within a week we had a functional radio station with 18 million songs at our disposal.  There&#x2019;s a devoted server just to the radio station, we are nearing two dozen djs, and we&#x2019;re doing great things.</p>
<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-next"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-next" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s next? "></a>What&#x2019;s next? </h2><h2></h2><p>The answer is more of the same.  This community still needs some organization.  I have the reach, a community, and enough respect to pull it off.  I think the witnesses need to have some organized meeting times to have round table discussions and I&#x2019;m going to attempt to put that together.  We have some concerns about bid bots and business on the chain.  I&#x2019;d like to establish a Chamber of Commerce.  We need more tutorials going on programming so I&#x2019;ll keep sponsering a library.  And I&#x2019;ll keep leading efforts within the community to build new tools, share new tools, grow this platform, and help train and retain minnows on it.</p>
<h2 id="Pledges"><a href="#Pledges" class="headerlink" title="Pledges "></a>Pledges </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m planning to keep leading the Minnow Support Project as long as the witnesses and moderators will tolerate me doing so.</p>
<p>I plan to keep delegating to project and people that help the Steem and MSP ecosystem.  This will range at any given time, but I don&#x2019;t plan to power down more than 10% of my witness earnings, and I hope to keep them piled back into minnows, @minnowsupport, and other community accounts we use to help various projects and causes along the way.  I roughly think 10% may be powered down for expenses, 30% on a few bidbots that help minnows, 30% on msp related bots, and the remainder on individual minnows that will do a nice job curating in the community.  It&#x2019;ll shift at any given time of the year, but that&#x2019;s my rough outline.</p>
