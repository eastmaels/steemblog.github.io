<p>We&#x2019;ve spent many episodes discussing the concept of Peace and how we can implement it within our community, and we spent a few episodes talking about Liberty and the truth of the world in which we live.<br>In our last episode we focused on Abundance as many of us are feeling it with the current spike of SBD!</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="Show-Highlights"><a href="#Show-Highlights" class="headerlink" title=" Show Highlights  "></a><center> Show Highlights  </center></h1><ul>
<li><p>The amazing opportunity that Steemit has given all of us to create abundance within our lives.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The goal of continuing to build the MSP community to help people achieve success in a faster time frame.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Why we should let the price of SBD rise.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The distribution on steem is that the top 1% own 93% of it so if we allow this spike of SBD it will benefit the active community of 30,000 steemians who are posting which is a much healthier form of distribution.</p>

<p>So, since I got involved with bidbots I&#x2019;ve had to also start talking a lot about curation.  Curation is a hot topic item and it goes hand in hand with curation and delegation because all of these things impact the rewards that are paid out on a daily basis.  There are people saying curation is broken, and it&#x2019;s tough to know how to answer that&#x2026; but I want to share a little about how curation works especially in an account lifecycle.</p>
<h2 id="Dividends"><a href="#Dividends" class="headerlink" title="Dividends "></a>Dividends </h2><h2></h2><p>One of my favorite ways to view curation rewards is through the lens of dividends.  If you own certain types of stock (or crypto) they will pay you dividends.  This is a return on your investment paid by the company as an incentive to continue to hold that investment.  Steem has this through inflation.  Every year a little less than 10% of total steem in existence will be added to the Steem economy.  The blockchain generates new coins through inflation, and then distributes those new coins from inflation into the rewards pool.  When you get post rewards you remove tokens from the (virtual) rewards pool and add them to your wallet.</p>
<p>By owning steem you control a certain amount of where all the new steem will go.  Essentially your ownership of the block allows you to determine where inflation heads.  Another way to look at this is you&#x2019;re receiving dividends and you&#x2019;re able to apply them however you want.  You can self vote, circle jerk, not use, give to a bid bot, curate heavily, delegate, and probably a few other things I haven&#x2019;t thought of.  You&#x2019;re essentially controlling how you spend your dividends and how to use them.</p>
<h2 id="&#x201C;Curation-is-broken&#x201D;"><a href="#&#x201C;Curation-is-broken&#x201D;" class="headerlink" title="&#x201C;Curation is broken&#x201D; "></a>&#x201C;Curation is broken&#x201D; </h2><h2></h2><p>One of the concerns I see is that curation for minnows is broken.  I&#x2019;d like to share that it&#x2019;s currently working, but there isn&#x2019;t much incentive for minnows to curate beyond using their curation to make friends as opposed to make a living.  The argument that thoughtful curation doesn&#x2019;t provide a lot of benefit is true (for minnows), but fails to take into account the fact that curation rewards are relative to how much stake you have.  </p>
<h2 id="Lifecyle"><a href="#Lifecyle" class="headerlink" title="Lifecyle "></a>Lifecyle </h2><h2></h2><p>If you&#x2019;re here for fun then ignore everything I&#x2019;m about to say and do things for fun.  If you&#x2019;re here to make some rewards then let me share with you the most rewarding activities that you can do on the block.</p>
<p><strong>Minnows</strong> (newer accounts)- Your best bet is to comment and socialize in offchain groups.  If you post you&#x2019;ll make next to nothing unless you hit the lottery.  You don&#x2019;t have enough followers most likely to see any returns.  If you curate you have so little stake that it won&#x2019;t make much impact.  It&#x2019;s like trying to live off of the dividends of 1 share of IBM.  So, your best bet is to comment.  Not many people will see your posts, but if you&#x2019;re making good comments on a post with lots of views people may see and read those.  You&#x2019;ll make 10x what you could do other activities by commenting a lot, and the other main benefit is that you&#x2019;ll also start to collect followers.  </p>
<p>Good followers are the most important thing you can have around here as that determines how much money your posts will make.  The more eyes with more stake that see your post the more likely it is you&#x2019;ll be rewarded.</p>
<p><strong>Dolphins</strong> 5k-50k SP -  These folks need to spend the majority of their time authoring.  You&#x2019;re at the point where you get more views on a post than you do on a comment buried in someone elses post.  You&#x2019;re getting some serious followers and you&#x2019;re starting to earn fairly steady and potentially growing rewards on your posts.  You should be authoring to keep getting the word out, and making sure that you&#x2019;re engaging with your audience to keep them coming back for more on your post.  Minnows are investing their time to comment on you.  You should be upvoting their comments and interacting with them if you&#x2019;d like to preserve those interactions.</p>
<p>You still don&#x2019;t make that much curating here.  You might have 10k steem, but again just like a stock you can&#x2019;t live off of the dividends of owning 500 shares of IBM (unless you&#x2019;re living off the grid in a camper shitting in the woods).</p>
<p><strong>Whales</strong> 50kSP or more - Now your life starts to look different.  You have 10 votes a day that have post rewards of $6 or more, but those are denominated in rewards bucks which are a mix of SBD and steem.  With SBD so high the number that shows up on a post isn&#x2019;t really reflective of what you&#x2019;re going to earn.  A better estimate is to take that number and multiply by 5.  So a newly minted whale can hit a post with a $30 (USD) upvote 10 times a day.  So, that&#x2019;s $300/day they can put on posts.  If they are simply curating they could make $60USD/day which is $21,000 per year.  This starts looking like some real money.  because that is actually how much a mortgage might cost in a year on a $300k house or so.</p>
<p>If they self vote twice that&#x2019;s $108/day.  That&#x2019;s now higher than the average family salary in the states or roughly near it.  So, when you have some real stake in this place you can make some real money by curating.  You also start getting followers just by having steem on the platform.  You also start getting large votes from other whales because you have the ability to hit them back with a substantial vote.  It&#x2019;s not quite circle jerking because it isn&#x2019;t quite planned, but many of the big votes come on the platform with a tip of the hat and a nod to a friend/fellow whale.</p>
<h2 id="My-point"><a href="#My-point" class="headerlink" title="My point "></a>My point </h2><h2></h2><p>The economics of curation don&#x2019;t favor minnows.  And if you&#x2019;re here thinking you&#x2019;re going to do well simply by curating you&#x2019;re going to be sadly disappointed.  That said, one of the things you can do as a minnow is to provide a curation service to whales.  You can go through the 40k posts and find good ones, and make a page of that.  @gmuxx has had some pretty incredible success doing that, and there are others as well.  But you have to understand there is a difference in providing the service of finding good posts and actually curating them&#x2026; you&#x2019;re a minnow&#x2026;. you vote doesn&#x2019;t do shit, your curation rewards from your voting does even less, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean you have no role in helping to discover good content.</p>
<h2 id="Anyway"><a href="#Anyway" class="headerlink" title="Anyway "></a>Anyway </h2><h2></h2><p>Curation takes an assload of time.  It&#x2019;s hard to find that time.  I also have a ton of people in MSP that are extremely passionate about curating stuff.  Currently we&#x2019;re using @minnowsupport to curate, but that drains from all the newest accounts on the platform where that 10-50 cent vote is a large part of their post rewards.  So, I&#x2019;ve started @msp-curation and given access to @isaria and @juliakponsford.  I&#x2019;ll probably add a few others, but the intent is to stop curation from @minnowsupport once this account hit&#x2019;s 10k or more. </p>
<p>So, I recently delegated 2500SP (it was matched by @ausbitbank).  I&#x2019;m delegating another 2kSP today.  We&#x2019;ll take curation off @minnowsupport hopefully before 2018 starts.</p>
<p>If you think that curation is important and don&#x2019;t always have time to do it please consider delegating to msp-curation.  Here&#x2019;s a link to put 1k SP on the account:  <a href="https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegator=&amp;delegatee=msp-curation&amp;vesting_shares=2051057.924655%20VESTS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegator=&amp;delegatee=msp-curation&amp;vesting_shares=2051057.924655%20VESTS</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other msp accounts this one has ZERO automatic voting and is entirely manually curated and it&#x2019;s specifically geared to be 100% human curated.</p>

<p>I want to give slightly earlier notice than normal because of two nice developments for the Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  This Sunday night I&#x2019;m having not one but two youtube sensations on the Minnow Mayor Town Hall.</p>
<h2 id="David-Pakman"><a href="#David-Pakman" class="headerlink" title="David Pakman "></a>David Pakman </h2><h2></h2><p>Hopefully you&#x2019;ve seen this youtuber as he hit the trending page recently.  David runs and stars in a political Youtube channel, which you can find here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MidweekPolitics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/user/MidweekPolitics</a>.  He&#x2019;s made some pleas to his channel, which boasts 400k subscribers, to come to to Steem.  Essentially here at Steem they can write, post, earn and support David and his work.  So far so good David.  You&#x2019;re on fire and here&#x2019;s hoping mspwaves can help pour some gasoline on it!</p>
<h2 id="Angelo-Atienza-from-They-Will-Kill-You"><a href="#Angelo-Atienza-from-They-Will-Kill-You" class="headerlink" title="Angelo Atienza from They Will Kill You "></a>Angelo Atienza from They Will Kill You </h2><h2></h2><p>I had a great conversation with Angelo last night.  He&#x2019;s agreed to come on the air the same night as David.  Angelo has nearly a million subscribers and recently launched a crypto channel as well.  Angelo runs They Will Kill You, and like David has expressed some concerns about the YouTube Adpocolapse.  While talking with him he mentioned that he&#x2019;s friends with a bunch of people that have successful YouTube channels like him (many were his roommates at one time).  That lead to an epic idea!</p>
<h2 id="5-Million-Subscriber-YouTube-Panel"><a href="#5-Million-Subscriber-YouTube-Panel" class="headerlink" title="5 Million Subscriber YouTube Panel!  "></a>5 Million Subscriber YouTube Panel!  </h2><h2></h2><p>Between David and Angelo we&#x2019;re up to 1.4M youtube subscribers.  With maybe 3 more or so we can have an audience of 5M YoutTube folks and David and Angelo both seem game to help do that!  So, here&#x2019;s the plan.  I&#x2019;ve offered to pay these folks 100 steem each to be on the panel discussion and 100 steem to any of their buddies with large youtube channels too.  Should be fun, should help grow some interest in the platform, might get some of them active again, and even with a simple thing like &#x201C;click here to my steem profile&#x201D; at the end of their videos I think we could see a ton of activity.</p>
<h2 id="Wanna-listen-to-the-show-live-and-interact-with-them"><a href="#Wanna-listen-to-the-show-live-and-interact-with-them" class="headerlink" title="Wanna listen to the show live and interact with them? "></a>Wanna listen to the show live and interact with them? </h2><h2></h2><p>David and Angelo will be live during the Minnow Mayor Town Hall this Sunday night.  The show starts at 8pm EST (0100UTC) and runs to 11 or midnight.  David will be on right at 9:30.  It&#x2019;s a big of a mystery still what time Angelo will be there.</p>
<p>You can listen to the show live here: <a href="https://discord.gg/pGHjVtc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/pGHjVtc</a> or mspwaves.com/listen.<br>You can interact by text by going here: <a href="https://discord.gg/BS8WTzM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/BS8WTzM</a></p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re hoping to go on air with me please make sure you have a working mic and headset and you can test out your audio here: <a href="https://discord.gg/hesUJmg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/hesUJmg</a></p>
<h2 id="Dice-Bitches"><a href="#Dice-Bitches" class="headerlink" title="Dice Bitches "></a>Dice Bitches </h2><h2></h2><p>We&#x2019;ll play dice bitches for 50 steem.  The rules changed slightly as the bot is slightly different</p>
<p>we start with t!dice 10d10 and will keep moving down from there 9d9 and 8d8 and so on.<br>If you tie my roll or beat it you&#x2019;re in the next level.  If you&#x2019;re the last person standing you&#x2019;ll win.<br>If I win once we&#x2019;ll try again.  If I win twice I&#x2019;ll send the money to @msp-waves.</p>
<h2 id="Delegation"><a href="#Delegation" class="headerlink" title="Delegation "></a>Delegation </h2><h2></h2><p>I think I&#x2019;m going to switch up how my delegation works.  I think I&#x2019;m going to start delegating to an audience based account, and people that show up to the shows frequently will be given automatic votes!  I&#x2019;m thinking that roughly every time you show up to one of my shows I&#x2019;ll add some percentage to the auto vote.  That way everyone wins that comes to listen!</p>
<h2 id="See-you-there-and-I&#x2019;m-looking-forward-to-building-this-panel"><a href="#See-you-there-and-I&#x2019;m-looking-forward-to-building-this-panel" class="headerlink" title="See you there and I&#x2019;m looking forward to building this panel!

        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/11/15/20/58/sports-2952559_960_720.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I founded the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network.  I didn&#x2019;t just stumble across those three words randomly.  I&#x2019;ve spent many years and gone through a touch of hell to figure out some basic truths that I observe about the world.  The current system is broken.  Or, more precisely, the current system is working perfectly in it&#x2019;s design, but the current design leaves much to be desired for the vast majority of people.  When I look at the scoreboard I see 1% of the population has 90% of the wealth, and literally 8 people/families have as much wealth as over 3 Billion people.  Those 8 people are not 10^9 better or more valuable than any of those in the lower 3B people group.  What has happened is that an economic system was successfully implemented that funnelled wealth from the poorest to the system creators and those system creators are now the wealthiest people around.</p>
<p>Now, funnelling wealth isn&#x2019;t always a bad thing.  Capital should go where it needs to, but there are a few problems here.  The first is that this capital is coerced.  Taxation is theft, or to George Bushize it Taxification is theftication.  People get in the middle of your daily commerce and say you can&#x2019;t exchange that piece of bread for the unit of exchange unless you give us a portion of that unit of exchange.  If you don&#x2019;t we&#x2019;ll arrest you and throw you in prison.  How is that not theft?  Just because lots of people agreed it&#x2019;s ok to take what&#x2019;s yours doesn&#x2019;t mean it isn&#x2019;t theft.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmbChKNPZJWbYAakiJkMrsnjwuGYu92VRH5k2mhgSDrjzZ/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, the first problem is that the wealth is funneled under duress, and the second problem is how they use it.  A recent survey reported that the USG is considered the largest threat to peace in the world.  No wonder&#x2026; we&#x2019;re bombing 7 countries right now.  And that military industrial complex is expensive.  Roughly 70% of all taxes paid (at least the ones officially on the books) go to pay a military budget.  Essentially money you invest under duress in government services has a 70% overhead for the military.  That seems like a bad investment.</p>
<p>So, my first issue with the world as it stands is vast sucking sound of the banking and government complex absorbing wealth from the poor and middle class and then further making it worse by spending it on violent projects.  To make matters even worse from that they have further increased spending and their projects into the realm of a massive spy net.  Programs like the intelligence agencies are recording your calls, keeping your dic pics, and categorically tracking all the things you say and do on the internet.</p>
<h2 id="But-Aggroed&#x2026;-I-have-nothing-to-hide-so-I&#x2019;m-ok-with-that"><a href="#But-Aggroed&#x2026;-I-have-nothing-to-hide-so-I&#x2019;m-ok-with-that" class="headerlink" title="But Aggroed&#x2026; I have nothing to hide, so I&#x2019;m ok with that.  "></a>But Aggroed&#x2026; I have nothing to hide, so I&#x2019;m ok with that.  </h2><h2></h2><p>That&#x2019;s a really short sighted view of this.  Just because it&#x2019;s not cool to persecute you for something that you do now doesn&#x2019;t mean that they won&#x2019;t come after you later.  Maybe marajuana legalization goes south and all those pictures of you and some blunts lands you in prison.  Maybe you studied cryptos.  What if government starts watching how nearly every fiat dollar in the world is discarded for crypto and decides to outlaw it to protect the monopoly they&#x2019;ve created.  There&#x2019;s thousands of pages of laws on the books, and these aren&#x2019;t designed to enhance your freedom, but to extract wealth from you and keep you under tight control</p>
<p>So, what&#x2019;s my point&#x2026; the world as it stands is a bit of shitshow of violence, theft, and a giant spynet, and that&#x2019;s why the world needs crypto.  This thing has the power to bring down the nation state.</p>
<h2 id="Woah-that&#x2019;s-a-big-leap-how-tf-did-you-get-there"><a href="#Woah-that&#x2019;s-a-big-leap-how-tf-did-you-get-there" class="headerlink" title="Woah, that&#x2019;s a big leap, how tf did you get there? "></a>Woah, that&#x2019;s a big leap, how tf did you get there? </h2><h2></h2><p>The governments rely not only on taxes, but on an entire economic system.  After world war II the Bretton Woods Accords made the USD the world reserve currency.  All transactions now have to go through the USD.  For 60 years this has forced other nations to accept USDs.  At the very start this may have been good for nations and trade, but what has happened is the USG has been printing paper and forcing other nations to return goods and services for printed paper.  That&#x2019;s not an equal exchange of wealth.  We print shit out of thin air, and you give us all of your natural resources.  That&#x2019;s a bad trade.</p>
<p>Now, once you have the ability to print money at a whim and force the world to accept it you can do shit like grow a massive military budget that&#x2019;s both on and off the books.  And you can use that military to enforce the rule that other nations have to accept our dollars.  While the general sentiment is that the wars currently fought are over oil, and I don&#x2019;t quite disagree I would put them in the larger context of the US is picking off enemies that voice concern or act out of line with the world reserve currency enforcement.</p>
<h2 id="My-central-point-buried-this-far-down"><a href="#My-central-point-buried-this-far-down" class="headerlink" title="My central point buried this far down "></a>My central point buried this far down </h2><h2></h2><p>Out of all the things that nations truly rely on it&#x2019;s the creation of money that now puts them squarely in charge.  They inflate it, loan it to their friends, use it to build militaries and spy networks, and basically put up a giant control grid around all of us.  One of the first steps to removing this power is creating an alternative to it.  Finally we not only have an alternative, but a really fucking good one.  </p>
<p>Cryptos go through artifical state boundaries like a hot knife through butter.  Cryptos work quickly.  Cryptos usually don&#x2019;t have 1/1000th the inflation of fiat dollars.  Cryptos are generally decentralized rather than centralized.  Basically all the shit that makes government fiat money bad for everyday people has been undone by the nature and design of cryptocurrencies.  These are a force for good(s)!</p>
<h2 id="bitcoin-at-16k"><a href="#bitcoin-at-16k" class="headerlink" title="bitcoin at 16k "></a>bitcoin at 16k </h2><h2></h2><p>The fact that bitcoin is at 16k shows the utility of this alternative currency type, and it&#x2019;s a combination of the dollar losing value and cryptos gaining value that makes it so freaking appealing.  This baby has been on a 1% gain per day curve for a few years now.  That&#x2019;s the opposite of government dollars that lose value every single day.  I&#x2019;m personally trying to remove as much wealth from fiat dollars to put into crypto currencies as possible.  Buy a few coins today and spend them in a few years to buy my house.  That&#x2019;s the power of a healthy currency, and as people switch from these government systems that steal wealth to do bad thing I&#x2019;m looking forward to seeing a a future that looks different.</p>
<h2 id="What-does-the-future-look-like"><a href="#What-does-the-future-look-like" class="headerlink" title="What does the future look like? "></a>What does the future look like? </h2><h2></h2><p>I see a world where the governments themselves have been nuetered.  Where these bastards can no longer steal and cause harm.  Where the spying and the theft are curtailed and where people are free.</p>
<p>I see a cryptopunk world forming out there.  Instead of the violence, theft, and spying I see a world filled with peace, abundance, and liberty.  Instead of a world where my daughters and I are molested if we want to cross an artificial line on the map I see open borders, free trade, and no one intruding in my commerce.  I see a world where centralized military forces have no place.  I see a world where I&#x2019;m free to exist so long as I cause no harm.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m happy to be on this journey with you, and thanks for changing the world around us with me!</p>

<p>Well, chalk one up to the good guys.  Craigslist has just started sorting all of their seller ads with the option to choose only those who are willing to accept crypto!  BOOM!  That&#x2019;s great news for our industry.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmbgLFHukeJGQWLdeebWCGmNdaFCxko5kx4xEPVin8NA8s/image.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="What-happens-when-I-check-out-cars-in-Boston"><a href="#What-happens-when-I-check-out-cars-in-Boston" class="headerlink" title="What happens when I check out cars in Boston? "></a>What happens when I check out cars in Boston? </h2><h2></h2><p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmbSnncdLZm2GEM4rsEx9LvtBov8csnABQcfV2PGASmVaL/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I&#x2019;m pretty pleased by the list of options available and the number of people that are willing to accept crypto for their vehicle.  I have some questions about how to fill out a transfer deed or something like that if I&#x2019;m using crypto, but overall I&#x2019;m stoked that I can pay with crypto as opposed to pay with fiat!</p>
<p>So, I went looking for more stuff.  I&#x2019;m a little nervous because things are a little sparse to start.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmP4SNnNuMrjzS4zzZjaimK48RMY8ppcJeRNCkxdg5Q1kB/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But then again this hasn&#x2019;t been going on for all that long.  So, another way to look at this is things are looking healthy considering the business model is less than a week old.</p>
<h2 id="ATV"><a href="#ATV" class="headerlink" title="ATV "></a>ATV </h2><h2></h2><p>I have a love of ATVs.  One of the first days I took one out I rolled it down the slope of a ski mountain in NH.  Took a lickin&#x2019; and drove fine after a 6 flip roll.  So, I checked that out too.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmU2hS34gAHrHUXGGBV85sMUZPMXDS2GE144R2zKX9VJ6w/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This one is looking pretty sparse actually.  If you compare it to the main atv without crypto acceptance you can see there are 900+ entries vs 8 or so.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmZ4U2aAC19UnLp9cG489wwFBYvss1AHxEfYs14mrmPMXr/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, I assess we&#x2019;re off to a strong start.  I&#x2019;ll check in on this in week or two and I hope to see more things listed.  </p>

<p>These fuckers are clearly bad mouthing crypto.  They go on to basically imply that we&#x2019;re all a bunch of shady bastards.  I don&#x2019;t know how to overcome that.  Wanting anonymity from the government doesn&#x2019;t necessarily make one a shady bastard.  thinking the currency is going to drop in value relative to altcoins ins&#x2019;t necessarily a shady bastard.  I mean, there are shady bastards in crypto, but there are in the terrestrial world&#x2026; especially governments.</p>
