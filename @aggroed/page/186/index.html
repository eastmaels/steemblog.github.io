            <p>Steem will keep dropping as long as the whales keep selling and there aren&#x2019;t enough people buying.  Since the overall volume on poloniex is like 200 btc ($16k) and the amount that the big accounts are powering down in $114k worth the price will go down.  In the short term this will drive the price down, BUT!!!  This will drive some bloggers out and will reduce the overall market cap of this place.  So, it&#x2019;s going to get worse.  Then in about 3 months many of the big power downs will end and the price will be pretty low I imagine 1 cent or so.  Then some people will look around and say &#x201C;Hey, the power downs stopped, the price isn&#x2019;t dropping any more, this is a good time to buy!&#x201D;  Then lots of people will buy, and as people buy the price will go up, and people will be attracted, and I imagine this place will be booming again.  </p>
<p>This hinges on the whales keep selling.  If they don&#x2019;t sell on the cheap then it won&#x2019;t redistribute, and if it doesn&#x2019;t redistribute you won&#x2019;t get the gains in number of people in the system, which means you won&#x2019;t see the price rise.  Hell, even if they don&#x2019;t sell and just power down there is going to be a shit ton of steem hangin&#x2019; around and that will drive the price as much or more as actually selling it.</p>
<p>Hang on to your hats it&#x2019;s gonna be a rough couple of months.  Stay calm and buy low.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m primarily a blogger on here.  I have a small amount invested, but basically I&#x2019;m here to learn and blog.  What I want as a blogger is expensive steem.  Why?  Because when steem is high the rewards for blogging are high so I make more money.  Does everyone want high steem?  Not necessarily.</p>
<p>There are a handful of classes of people that are using Steemit right now.  I would argue the major classes are: founders, long term investors, short term investors, bloggers, merchants, and friends.  </p>
<p>Founders have the long term goal of making money and the short term goal of paying their bills.  I don&#x2019;t see a lot of money collected by the system, so they use the fat @steemit account to pay off the bills.  Ironically, this approach hurts their ability to do that.  Yesterday for example $154k of steem hit their account.  That&#x2019;s more than double the whole volume of steem sold on poloniex.  Having that much excess steem is bad for price because it will drive the value of steem down.  That&#x2019;s bad for the founders because if they are trying to pay their bills with it they want a high price so they get more out of every steem.  The @steemit account powerdown is going to cause price distruptions for a long time because of how large that account is.  Overall, I think they want a high price of steem, but unfortunately have to act in their own disinterest and sell large amounts of it keeping the price of steem low.</p>
<p>The long term investors before the hardfork didn&#x2019;t really care about price.  Yes the price was going down, but inflation was so high that the value of their account didn&#x2019;t really change.  They didn&#x2019;t care.  Now that inflation is a tenth of what it was they don&#x2019;t get that influx anymore.  The long term investors want to see the price slowly and steadily rising so that they can put in government fiat currency over time and see it go up in value.  They want slow steady price increases and would likely feel they missed out if steem suddenly shot up.</p>
<p>Day traders want the full experience of the chaotic crypto market.  Government fiat currencies against each other may not move more than 1% a year.  Crypto fiat currencies can see that kind of change happens a couple of times between breakfast and elevensies.  Day traders want the fluctuations so they can trade off the deltas while watching the stock curve around and around.</p>
<p>Bloggers want high prices.  We do.  We want $100 steem so every word I right on a page is $5.  $0.16 steem is a total bummer.  My median post despite having 280 followers and a rep of 65 is like $0.50.  Great&#x2026; an hours work for 1 reces peanut butter cup (not the whole candy with 2 packaged in it&#x2026; literally just 1 of the two candies).</p>
<p>Merchants want a steady price.  They hate the crazy flucuations because they want don&#x2019;t want to have a dynamic pricing model.  They want a shirt to be $15 and not an algo that tracks daily fluctuations in steem and dollar value to come up with some consistant pricing mechanism.</p>
<p>Friends aren&#x2019;t here for the money.  They like the blockchain tech and the lack of censorship (minus the flagging).  They might become investors or others some day but they aren&#x2019;t there yet.</p>
<p>So, when I look at Poloniex and see we are down at $0.15 I frown and sigh.  I know the price is going to keep going down while the 3 month sell off is happening.  At some point I&#x2019;ll buy in along what I think is the bottom.  We&#x2019;re 100% in my mind going back to $0.10 steem, and I honestly think we&#x2019;ll go below that.  Too much steem.  Not enough buyers, which is frustrating because it likely means there aren&#x2019;t enough users, which likely means the price is too low.</p>
<p>All that is why I advocate for a 10:1 reverse split.  Get the price back to $1.60 and watch people come flock here.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/945a7143a5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Anyway, it&#x2019;s going down, and there will likely be little buying sprees over the next few months that I will try to sell into, but this baby is going down, down, down for the next 3 months at least.  And if the whales don&#x2019;t cash out at $0.10 and try to hold then it&#x2019;s going to linger at $0.10 or there abouts for years until something happens to magically get all the people excited about steemit somehow.</p>

<p>When I go to a party I&#x2019;m mostly there to troll new people and see how they do.  I&#x2019;m constantly looking for funny new friends with a good thick skin to see who could tolerate me for a long enough period to be a long term friend.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m old enough now that the parties end up with a range of ages, and that means that some of these new fangled millenials are starting to show up at the party.  The age range of Millennial changes depending on your source.  When it starts and when it ends is pretty up for grabs.  I was born in &#x2018;79 so the way I like to troll is to use the definition of anyone born in the 80s and beyond is a millenial.  I actually agree with it&#x2019;s probably from the mid 70s is the starting rise up of millenials and that there&#x2019;s really a bell curve effect here rather than a hard stop in the 80s; however, the point while being at a party is not to have an enlightenend conversation, but it&#x2019;s to troll for new friends.  So, there&#x2019;s the setup.</p>
<p>So, I make a few comments about all these young people and one of them takes the bait.  He picks up on the conversation about how old people are.  Now I say something like a grumpy old man about all these damn millennials and he says is epic millennial thought.  &#x201C;Wait, Millennial is like 1982 and beyond.  It can&#x2019;t be 1980 because I don&#x2019;t think of myself as a millennial.&#x201D;  Above and beyond all the negative sterotypes of basement dwelling hipsters one of the most central themes that I&#x2019;ve been playing with in response to the millennial generation is self-identity and assuming one&#x2019;s self-identity.  To me there is nothing more quintessential about being a millennial than claiming you are not one because you don&#x2019;t self-identify with it.</p>
<p>My jokes at the party with my liberal friends are in that &#x201C;Did you just assume&#x2026;&#x201D; vein.  My best friends wife was wondering around with a pearl earring.  She was asking people if it was theirs and skipped me.  So, I say &#x201C;Wait, did you just assume my ear lobe jewelry status?&#x201D;  To which she smiled and said &#x201C;I looked!&#x201D;  The whole joke is about assuming one&#x2019;s gender, or assuming one&#x2019;s preference of one sort or another and that&#x2019;s because millennials don&#x2019;t let things like genetic makeup get in the way of how they self-perceive.  I find it fascinating and a little bit moronic because defining man and woman should be as simple as XX or XY and yet this generation more than any other has blasted through genital definitions and gone full bore into fluid gender role definitions.  At the same time I find it pretty heroic.  Who the fuck am I or anyone else to tell them how to be, do, act, live, or perceive themselves.  I think some of what they do flies in the face of logic, but honestly it&#x2019;s a movement that&#x2019;s still really young so I&#x2019;m happy to cut them some slack and they figure out good lines to cross and ones that don&#x2019;t make sense.</p>
<p>Now, later to confirm it I mentioned something about participation trophies.  He shared that his mom was cleaning out his old stuff, handed him a box, and in it were a stack of participation certificates.  So, that&#x2019;s another way that I was winning the argument that he was a millennial.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, my main point here, is that it&#x2019;s the most quintessential thing for a Millennial to share they aren&#x2019;t millennials because they don&#x2019;t self identify as one.  </p>
<p>For the record I self-identify as a gender fluid, previously deceased, vegan, home schooled, fair trade, diety agnostic, selective agoristic libertarian, honorary attorney, veloco-dino born in an indeterminate time between generational stereotypes and would prefer you to reference me using my suggested pronoun &#x201C;The Late Sergeant&#x201D; to reference the time when I thought of myself as a great general in the meme wars.</p>

            <p>This is an article written by Anna Von Reitz.  She&#x2019;s living in Alaska and calls herself a state judge.  She differentiates between the state of alaska and alaska state. The state of alaska is a corporation.  It&#x2019;s a government services contract organization that&#x2019;s masquerading as the alaska state which is a constitutional republic.  She argues in other writings that basically every official in America is following a similar scheme.  There is a very real and healthy constiutional republic that has been abandoned since the civil war.  That&#x2019;s because when the south seceeded there was no longer a quorum and so the north created a corporate entity that claimed to represent the true republic and left all the republic seats and positions vacant.</p>
<p>As soon as the Obama is out of the office it&#x2019;s going to get very clear he&#x2019;s not actually an American.  The birther movement was probably correct there, but the missed the real story.  The reason he can sit as president and it&#x2019;s legal is that he&#x2019;s not actually the president of the united states which we think of as a constitutional republic.  He&#x2019;s president ie ceo of a government services corporation that is masquerading as a government.  There is no law against a ceo being from another country so he&#x2019;s not actually breaking the corporate mission statement and operating documents of the company (the Constitution of the United States of America).  he&#x2019;s breaking a million other laws, but it&#x2019;s ok to be a ceo of an american company from another country, but I digress.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s an alternative take on what the IRS is written by Anna Von Reitz.  I find her story and thoughts on what this government is extremely compelling.</p>
<p>The True History of the Income Tax and IRS &#x2014;- Again<br>The first income tax was called &#x201C;Peter&#x2019;s Pence&#x201D; and it was collected along with a Confession of Sins on April 15 every year in both England an France beginning in the early 1100&#x2019;s as an extra mandatory &#x201C;offering&#x201D; to pay for the cost of the Crusades.<br>Sound familiar? A tax on income&#x2026;.. a confession (filing)&#x2026;.due on April 15&#x2026;.to support the cost of a war?<br>Fast forward to the &#x201C;American Civil War&#x201D; &#x2014; a tax on income fails the constitutional test, but is imposed on all &#x201C;territorial citizens&#x201D;, that is, federal civilian and military employees and those born in the &#x201C;territories and possessions&#x201D; of the United States.<br>American state nationals are protected under the provisions of the Constitution(s) but federal citizens are not. Federal citizens can be taxed to the moon and back, and imposed upon and even killed by the whim of Congress acting as a plenary oligarchy operating a foreign municipal city state government.<br>Look at Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 and read Justice Harlan&#x2019;s dissenting opinion in Downes v. Bidwell and the rest of the Insular Tariff cases. You will see what has gone on here, how and why. You won&#x2019;t like it a bit, but you will catch on.<br>The first modern &#x201C;Internal Revenue Service&#x201D;&#x2014;then as now&#x2013; was operated entirely in international jurisdiction by privateers running first out of Barbados and later removed to Puerto Rico. The personnel responsible for collecting the tax are Merchant Marine Warrant Officers called &#x201C;Withholding Agents&#x201D;. The personnel responsible for oversight of all these Merchant Mariners and federal corporation operators are Internal Revenue Agents.<br>Abraham Lincoln fundraised for the war effort by selling &#x201C;1040 Bonds&#x201D;&#x2014;- so called because these bonds mature in either 10 or 40 years. The revenue realized by the sale is used to pay off war debt.<br>Today, the funds from the yearly collection of &#x201C;1040 Forms&#x201D; results in the issuance of more bonds based on the labor and assets of the people, but with the federal government and its &#x201C;federated state&#x201D; franchises being the beneficiaries.<br>Up to World War II, most Americans were not subject to the &#x201C;federal income tax&#x201D; at all&#x2014;- only federal civilian employees, military personnel, African Americans, people born in Puerto Rico, Guam, etc., federal welfare recipients and federal dependents (wards of state such as political asylum seekers), and actual corporations that held their charters under United States auspices were required to file as a condition of their employment or else their receipt of &#x201C;benefits&#x201D; from the Public Charitable Trust set up for the relief of poor black plantation slaves who were displaced by the Civil War or the &#x201C;privilege&#x201D; of a public charter to do &#x201C;indemnified&#x201D; business.<br>Then, as we entered WWII, Congress passed The Victory Tax&#x2014;- allowing non-citizens, that is, people who were not federal employees, not political asylum seekers, not African American, etc., to &#x201C;voluntarily&#x201D; pay the federal income tax as a patriotic gesture in support of the war effort.<br>Millions of patriotic American state nationals signed up and gave an average of two bucks extra a month to the government via direct contribution at their workplace, collected by their employers.<br>There was no specific end date attached to The Victory Tax, because there was no specific known date for the end of the war, so the tax was supposed to end with the &#x201C;end of hostilities&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x2014;meaning in real life, it should have no longer been collected from American state nationals as of August, 1945.<br>Instead, the Federales kept right on collecting&#x2014;-and enforcing the collection&#x2014; of federal income taxes from people who were never federal citizens and who never knowingly or voluntarily received any charter to operate as federal corporations, and who should have been released from any obligation upon the Japanese surrender.<br>This is why generations of Internal Revenue Commissioners and other IRS higher-up employees have stood in front of the TV cameras and described this as a &#x201C;voluntary tax&#x201D;.<br>You were misinformed about the nature of the tax and you were misinformed and told that it applied to you, when in fact it never did.<br>The word &#x201C;income&#x201D; itself by definition is a corporate accrual. Your wages, salaries, tips, and other earnings are private property.<br>So what&#x2019;s going on here?<br>A gigantic, vicious, self-interested fraud.<br>The fact is that by far the vast majority of Americans are naturally exempt from the federal income tax, and if you are, you can &#x201C;revoke your election to pay&#x201D;.<br>If you are an average American state national who is self-employed or employed in the private sector, you never really owed the federal income tax in the first place&#x2014; that is, if you were born on the land of one of the sovereign states and are not voluntarily choosing to operate as a federal corporation named after YOUR NAME, not a federal employee (United States Citizen), not a federal dependent (citizen of the United States), not African American, not born in Puerto Rico, etc. &#x2014; you are paying a tax you don&#x2019;t owe, one that never applied to you, and one that can&#x2019;t be forced upon you if you correctly object.<br>As you can see, there are people and there are organizations (actual corporations) that do owe the federal income tax, but there are also millions upon millions of people and organizations who do not and who never did owe any federal income tax who are being coerced and extorted out of large portions of the value of their labor under false pretenses and criminally self-interested legal presumptions.<br>The last time I looked, the &#x201C;revocation&#x201D; clause was located at Section 6013 of the Internal Revenue Code, Title 26. It gets moved around a bit, thanks to shuffling of pages and sections, but it remains as it has to remain as remedy for the crime being perpetuated against the people of this country.<br>You are free to send Notice to the Commissioner(s) of Revenue declaring your decision to &#x201C;revoke my election to pay federal income taxes&#x201D; at any time, and once you do this, you can NEVER pay federal income taxes again&#x2014;by law.<br>This will, I know, be a great disappointment to many&#x2026;..<br>However, there are a couple of caveats yet to be observed.<br>Your letter of revocation must be proven to be received, so you have to keep your mailing receipt and a copy of your letter and a return receipt, if at all possible, to prove that you sent your correspondence and that it was received by the (now three) IRS, Internal Revenue Service, and INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE Commissioners.<br>You have to remember that the federal fiscal year ends June 30 and begins July 1 of each year and that &#x201C;tax years&#x201D; lag behind normal calendar years. Thus, if you wish to stop paying taxes effective with the federal tax year of 2012, you would make your revocation of election effective July 1, 2011&#x2014;-the prior year.<br>And you should be at some pains to explain that you &#x201C;made a mistake&#x201D; and that you were never actually a volunteer Warrant Officer in the Merchant Marine Service and were confused about what a &#x201C;Withholding Agent&#x201D; was when you signed your prior 1040 forms.<br>Now that you know, you won&#x2019;t be confused again&#x2026;.<br>The submission of a 1040, 1065, or any other &#x201C;federal&#x201D; tax form creates the presumption that you are either a &#x201C;United States Citizen&#x201D; (employee) or &#x201C;citizen of the United States&#x201D; (slave) or operator of a federal corporation (YOUR NAME) or an actual business corporation with a federal charter. This presumption can be rebutted with a &#x201C;revocation of election to pay&#x201D; or simply never filing any federal tax forms to begin with and standing your ground as a private American state national&#x2014;so long as you are not naturally a member of one of those groups who are actually required to pay federal income taxes.<br>If you have already made the mistake of filing paperwork as a &#x201C;Withholding Agent&#x201D;, the act of doing so creates a &#x201C;novation contract&#x201D; which is a repetition of performance contract&#x2014;&#x2013;another legal presumption that you are in fact a volunteer Warrant Officer in the Merchant Marines and that you will be filing tax forms again the next year.<br>This is what gives rise to &#x201C;Failure to File&#x201D; charges.<br>However, now that you have admitted your mistake and that you know what a Withholding Agent is &#x2014;and know that you are not a Withholding Agent&#x2014;it would be illegal inducement to perjure yourself to require you to file anything saying that you were voluntarily acting in that capacity, wouldn&#x2019;t it?<br>Yes, indeed. It would.<br>One of the most curious facts is that if you file a 1040 or other form and you make any mistakes at all&#x2014;- on purpose or not &#x2014; you can be held accountable for a felony and up to five years in prison and all sorts of fines. But if you never file anything at all, the most you can be charged with is a misdemeanor and up to a year in jail.<br>This is because when you claim under penalty of perjury to be a federal officer &#x2014;- a Withholding Agent&#x2014; and fail to perform your duty, it is a serious crime under martial law. But when you claim no such official capacity and are merely presumed to be a &#x201C;federal citizen&#x201D; in the first place, the court has nothing but a legal presumption backing its actions against you and no actual evidence provided by your wet-ink signature on a 1040 or other filing.<br>So bust their presumptions. If you aren&#x2019;t naturally subject to federal territorial or municipal jurisdiction, nor overjoyed with the &#x201C;service&#x201D; you are receiving from the &#x201C;federal government&#x201D; corporation and its federated &#x201C;states of states&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x2013; claim your exemption. Revoke your election to pay federal income taxes. Stop paying the Beast that is offering to eat you.<br>It is your right and at some point, your responsibility, to see to it that your money is funding the actual government that is owed to you and not a fly-by-night foreign subcontractor making false claims against you and fleecing you blind. ~Anna Von Reitz</p>

<p>You should check out a new site that @bitcoiner put into the world.  It&#x2019;s steemdown.com.  There you can see the whales that are powering down.  One major one to look at is @steemit, because the founders decided to keep more than 50% of the steem they created&#x2026;  Well, it&#x2019;s powering down.  In 2 days $154k worth of steem is going to hit the market.  I suspect because of how powering down works that next week an additional $154k of steem will hit and so on going for at least 3 months if not more.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s a lot of steem.  </p>
<p>Today 84 bitcoins worth of steem were traded.  Each bitcoin is just shy of $800.  So, that&#x2019;s $64000.  So, the total trading today is less than half of what&#x2019;s about to hit the market&#x2026;. that can&#x2019;t be good for the price of steem &#x2026; or is it?</p>
<p>See, to me the biggest scammiest shittiest part of this program is the very poor decision of the founders and employees of steemit to keep so much of the currency.  That&#x2019;s shady as fuck.  Startups don&#x2019;t keep 80% or more when they go looking for funding.  Investors balk.  Here it&#x2019;s even worse because they want this to be a currency.  Would you want to use a currency if 100 people had 80% of it?  Probably not.  Hopefully you&#x2019;d say something like &#x201C;Hey, this seems really scammy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>So, before you go rushing to buy on this next price drop from $150k worth of steem hitting the market calm your tits because it&#x2019;s going to happen over and over again for a few months.</p>
<p>If the whales/oligarchs/steem grinches really want this place to succeed they will sell their steem on the cheap.  Many people will buy in at a fair price, and the fact that so many people bought in will cause the price to rise.  In something like 6 months the price will go up to say a $1/steem or more.  If they decide to hold on to their steem at a high and unreasonable price we&#x2019;re going to be sitting in this never ending price slog where it&#x2019;s going to take years for the steem to clear out of the hands of the richest people and the price is going to linger down at $0.10-0.20 for I&#x2019;m guessing several years.</p>
<p>So, here&#x2019;s my plan that I&#x2019;m going to do.  Wait a few months for the initial steem dumps to happen.  If the price starts rising I will sell any steem I have into it because as long as 100M steem and steem power are sitting in 30 accounts they will be trying to cash out and that will cause the price to drop back down.  When the steem distribution starts looking reasonable I will start putting real dollars into buying steem because that&#x2019;s when the price will go back up.  </p>
<p>THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE STEEM ECONOMY IS THE REAL VALUE DRIVER OF THE PRICE OF STEEM.  So, if and when it gets accessible prepare yourself for a sustainable rally.</p>
<p>Oh, also it looks like I&#x2019;m going to lose steemit thousandaire status soon.  So, fml.</p>

<p>I wrote an article about this.  Part of BLM is a totally necessary and truly epic social movement trying to raise awareness of how the legal system and law enforcement is extremely racist and predjudiced against non-whites.  The other part of BLM is very likely a Soros funded operation busing paid instigators into hot zones to create additional havoc and racial tension, which creates fear and allows for different types of controls to be put in place against the best interest of the public at large.  </p>
<p>People kneeling during the national anthem are racial justice fighters similar to Rosa Parks.<br>People setting stores on fire and looting in the name of racial justice are paid instigators.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Ayelet Shaked is a member of the ultra-nationalist Jewish Home party, which is part of the ruling coalition. She is quoted as calling for the slaughter of Palestinian mothers who give birth to &#x201C;little snakes.&#x201D; Shaked posted a screed on Facebook that various critics are denouncing as a call for genocide. Shaked reportedly stated: &#x201C;They have to die and their houses should be demolished so that they cannot bear any more terrorists . . . are all our enemies and their blood should be on our hands. This also applies to the mothers of the dead terrorists.&#x201D;&#x201D;</p>
