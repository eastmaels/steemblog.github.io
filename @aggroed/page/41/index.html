        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/01/03/23/07/vermont-1950931_960_720.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So&#x2026; my wife went to camp and picked Baby1 up early and brought her home.  I drove up to Vermont and plan to stay here until the 19th when her time was supposed to end.  This is admittedly a weird move, but I don&#x2019;t agree with bringing her home.  I can&#x2019;t force my wife to change her mind/path nor can I have the camp accept her back this session now that she&#x2019;s left.  However, I can peacefully withdraw my consent for the plan my wife put in motion.  In this case I left letters for my wife, Baby1, and Baby2.</p>
<p>As my wife was picking her up I shared I don&#x2019;t consent.  I shared I think it&#x2019;s best she stay. I shared that I&#x2019;m not on board with the current plan.  I told her simply bringing her back would indicate a failure and I didn&#x2019;t think that it was healthy.</p>
<p>I told my wife I don&#x2019;t consent and that her choices made me feel like a prop rather than a father.  She worked out the plan with the camp director when I wasn&#x2019;t on the phone or part of the conversation.  This choice compounded  long term difficulties she and I have had in the past.  We have a large imbalance in our marriage of I tend to control money and she tends to control access and stewardship of children.  It isn&#x2019;t quite healthy but the imbalance in those spots seems well balanced against eachother.  I don&#x2019;t want to lose access to my children.  She doesn&#x2019;t want to lose access to funding for the house, schools, and children.  Somewhere in there is compromise even if awkward.  </p>
<p>Marriages assemble baggage.  I think we have more than our fair share.  She really is an incredible woman, but this time I think she lost her resolve to see this through because Baby1 was struggling.  Struggling is part of the camp process, and struggling over homesickness can be overcome if we give her time.  We were getting letters of I love it here, but I wish you were here.&#x201D;  That&#x2019;s pretty different than &#x201C;I hate it here I have to go home.&#x201D;  When we visited she couldn&#x2019;t walk through much of camp without receiving hugs from other campers.  It was and is a safe and wonderful place.  The struggle for Baby1 was &#x201C;it&#x2019;s hard&#x201D; not that &#x201C;it&#x2019;s unsafe.&#x201D;  So&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t agree.</p>
<p>I think this teaches all the wrong lessons.  If you cry your parents will swoop in and take care of you.  She&#x2019;s pretty flippant about &#x201C;well, I&#x2019;ll just try again next year.&#x201D;  She seems to forget that I&#x2019;m working my fucking ass off every single day to provide these things that she&#x2019;s now taking for granted.  That&#x2019;s not cool either.  I think it also shows that we don&#x2019;t have faith in her to complete what she started or it&#x2019;s ok to just quit when things get hard.  There&#x2019;s basically no part of this that I&#x2019;m ok with.  </p>
<p>My wife and I have used strategies of attachment parenting to raise our kids.  The results have been pretty astounding.  My kids are bright, strong, healthy, fun, and caring.  However, the challenge has been that I think it has sheltered them a little more than I intended and has made it too hard for Baby1 to stand on her own two feet without us.  That&#x2019;s no bueno.  So, I told my wife I don&#x2019;t consent to being a prop or to Baby1 coming home.  I chose a tactical withdrawl.</p>
<p>So, that leaves Baby1.  I started by telling her that I love her and always will love her.  Then I told her that I don&#x2019;t support the decision that she made.  I said I wasn&#x2019;t in a spot where I could share kind and supportive words about her choice.  Then I said just because I don&#x2019;t support this decision doesn&#x2019;t mean I don&#x2019;t support her.  I basically served my kid a <a href="https://steemit.com/howto/@aggroed/making-and-eating-a-shit-sandwich-the-importance-of-constructive-criticism-on-steemit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shit sandwich</a>.   I haven&#x2019;t heard back from my wife how Baby1 is dealing with this part of the grand plan, but no news may in fact be good news.  I don&#x2019;t know&#x2026; there&#x2019;s no one more supportive or better built for this support role than my wife.  I&#x2019;m trusting that duo can make it through this hard part.</p>
<p>Last up is Baby2.  She&#x2019;s got nothing to do with this other than having been whipped up and down the east coast a bunch of times.  She&#x2019;s been a trooper about it.  I know she&#x2019;s liked being the only child in the house for a while.  I really feel like this robs her of that experience.  I don&#x2019;t think much of this is fair to her, but here&#x2019;s hoping that this experience can be a good precurser to when she goes to camp 2 years from now.  She&#x2019;ll have to have some separation with her rock of her father too.  Maybe this will be healthy for them by then.</p>
<h2 id="Philosophy"><a href="#Philosophy" class="headerlink" title="Philosophy"></a>Philosophy</h2><p>One thing that gives me strength and comfort every day are two quick things.  I believe the universe is perfect in that it&#x2019;s a giant system designed to help our spirits grow.  We attract exactly what we need.  I think when my daughter chose us as parents and crossed the rainbow bridge to be with us she was going to get who were are for better or worse.  This is what I think is best for my daughter and family.  That may be through wifely and child protests.  IDK.  We&#x2019;ll see.  Maybe this won&#x2019;t be a big deal.  Maybe this is worse.  For now I&#x2019;m pretty sure it&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s best and I trust that the universe is providing us all with the perfect experience we all need to grow.</p>
<p>Next up there&#x2019;s a video that I use in nearly every hardship.  It&#x2019;s the story of good or bad.  The point is that there is neither good nor bad experiences.  Only experiences and we can&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s good or bad.  This is what I chose because I think it&#x2019;s best.  That&#x2019;s neither good nor bad.  There will be easy parts and hard parts to this, but what comes of this is unknown but perfect in it&#x2019;s own way.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m a life sailor.  I set a destination in the horizon and follow the winds as best as I can.  I trust the universe to get me to the right place.  In this case I&#x2019;ve set myself on a tough but healing and loving experience that&#x2019;s good for all of our developments.  Let&#x2019;s see if my family can steer there.</p>
<p>Namaste from Vermont,</p>

<p>So, I was recently able to visit the Libertarian National Convention and give a talk there.  I gave a working title of making money with Steemit.  I didn&#x2019;t get a chance to fix that, and it was printed that way.  There wasn&#x2019;t a huge audience for the discussion, but Ernie Hancock came and he has a pretty strong following of Libertarians.  I have a conversation with him on Thursday and hopefully we&#x2019;ll get his base more amped up about Steem.  Anyway, I gave a talk so here is the talk slides and a quick gist</p>

<p>I was helped by @kaylinart and @fyrstikken and learned how Steem can spread abundance.</p>

<p>That was an important lesson because the things I was fighting as an internet activist was war, poverty, and spying.  This seems to be a perfect antidote.</p>

<p>This is what I figured out. Steem is a fantastic tool to spread the message.</p>

        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This letter isn&#x2019;t for this audience.  This letter is for me to my kid.  You are welcome to read and judge accordingly, but I want this preserved on the blockchain while this experience is fresh in my head.</p>
<p>Dear Baby1,</p>
<p>I want you to know I&#x2019;m excessively proud of you.  I love being your dad more than anything else in this world.  When you were born I looked at your mom who has been my best friend for more than half my life and said &#x201C;Move over buddy, there&#x2019;s a new sheriff in town.&#x201D;  I&#x2019;ve never been more excited in my life than the first second I saw you.  I&#x2019;ve never been prouder of anything than being Dad for you and your sister.  I&#x2019;m grateful every day for this experience.</p>
<p>We chose to send you to summer camp together as a family.  I know you were incredibly excited for this opportunity.  I knew it would be hard. I remember when I went that I balled my eyes out.  I told my mom that I was too big for a teddy bear and that I didn&#x2019;t need it.  I called home two days into camp unconsolably balling saying that I wanted to go home and that I needed my bear.  My mom drove up to bring that to me and I tried to convince her to bring me home.  Somehow she summoned the will to leave me there and it&#x2019;s one of the best things that she could have done for my personal development.</p>
<p>Today when I visted you at camp you were absolutely balling and inconsolable that you wanted to go home.  The visit started great, but when we got close to leaving you made it extremely clear that you wanted to go home right then.  You were sharing that you had already had the experience that you needed to have there and that you were insistent that you could get that same experience at home.  You told me in no uncertain terms that we needed to go home with you in the car with us.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s not what I chose.  Mom looked you in the eyes and said today we&#x2019;re just visitors.  I told you that staying was the only option.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s hard to encompass how hard that decision was for me.  For whatever reason it was triggering my own personal experience when my mother had a stroke with late stage cancer.  The doctors asked if we should operate and I told them no.  It was the single worst day of my life.  This experience for whatever reason was pulling at those memories with some similiar feelings of making a highly significant decision for another person with many different possible outcomes.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s just to say that I didn&#x2019;t make the decision lightly.  What you were clear about was just how hard the experience was, and that you could get that same experience at home.  What I didn&#x2019;t have words to say at the time is that the very part of this that&#x2019;s hard, mainly the homesickness, is exactly what you can&#x2019;t get while at home.  This is an experience that tests our own abilities and teaches us not only about our limits but also our capabilities.  </p>
<p>You said it was too hard to do this far away from home.  It felt like a safe and wonderful place that you loved, but it was hard to be away.  You were giving up on yourself that you couldn&#x2019;t make it the rest of the way there.  Forgive me for this one, but I know you better than that.  I wasn&#x2019;t going to let you make a decision at a moment of weakness that you&#x2019;d regret later.  I choose to have you stay.</p>
<p>A secondary thing that made this so hard for me was the fact that I truly believe everyone should have liberty to make decisions for themselves, but in this case I think your judgement was compromised at the time, and I acted as a parent to protect the experiences that I know would help guide you and form you for the rest of your life.  I love you kiddo, and I couldn&#x2019;t let you or me take that away from you.</p>
<p>Make no mistake I&#x2019;ve been having a really hard time while you&#x2019;re away.  You&#x2019;re my best friend and it hurts every day that you aren&#x2019;t home.  My central anxiety in life is not having my kids with me in the house.  This is hard for me too, but I trust that this is the exact experience that can help us both grow.  I trust you&#x2019;ll come around to that.  If my heart sensors are right you already did.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ll add from personal experience that I call upon what I learned at camp all the time.  I&#x2019;m confidant when I&#x2019;m in front of people, I know my body can do hard work, I know how to make friends, and I trust that I can create a community from a group of strangers.  I learned these things at camp.  I also grew strong on the inside.</p>
<p>During camp we climbed mountains, we sailed the oceans, we rowed our kayaks and canoes down rivers, and we tested our very limits.  I know I can do hard things because I&#x2019;ve done hard things and it started when I was eight years old.  You too will lean on these experiences for the rest of your life and the strength that you gleam from them will get your through hard times.</p>
<p>When I got my PhD it was the hardest ongoing experience I&#x2019;d lived through.  I spent 8 months working 16hours every day only giving myself every other Sunday afternoon/evening off.  My advisor was telling me I wasn&#x2019;t going to graduate on time, work was telling me I had to make it or the job offer wouldn&#x2019;t be there, and my wife was telling me we had to get her out of the State of Texas.  I would work, go to the next hood over, cry a little bit, and get back to work.  The will to get back to work even though it was hard was built at camp.</p>
<p>When my mother was dying of brain cancer I was able to push through that time because of the inner strength that I had molded and formed at camp.</p>
<p>When I fought to rebuild my life after many years of hard living it was built on the self-esteem and force of will I learned at camp.</p>
<p>Somewhat ironically, the thing that gives me the strength to know that you should be at camp even when you don&#x2019;t want to and that gives me the will to tow the line was my camp experience.</p>
<p>So, having been on the other side of this experience and having used it for every hard piece of time in my life let me assure you I&#x2019;m not going to let us lose this opportunity for you during a moment of weakness.  I believe in you and know that you&#x2019;ll find a way.  You might not have it in you right this second, but you&#x2019;ll learn it and do it.  Then you&#x2019;ll have it.  That&#x2019;s how it works.</p>
<p>This decision wasn&#x2019;t easy at all for me even though I&#x2019;m feeling better about it.  I&#x2019;ve been crying off and on for the many hours of driving back home.  Here&#x2019;s the thing though.  One day I was asking my brother about some tough decions that lay in front of me.  He gave me some advice that I still use to this day.  &#x201C;Well, Bruddah, when faced with some tough life choices the thing that&#x2019;s harder to do is often the right one.&#x201D;  It would have been a lot easier on all of us to just get you in this car and bring you home, but easy decisions doesn&#x2019;t build character, will, strength, or awesomeness.  You deserve and will need all of those things.  I trust this experience will help you earn those character traits.</p>
<p>So look baby1.  I love you.  I&#x2019;m immensely proud of you for doing this thing.  I know it&#x2019;s hard and I know just how hard this part is for you.  I also know that especially because <del>even though</del> you&#x2019;re struggling that you&#x2019;re growing and doing great.  I&#x2019;m forever proud of you.  Forever grateful to be your dad, and I hope and trust that you&#x2019;ll know that I&#x2019;m just trying to do my best for you.  Here&#x2019;s hoping mom and I are right and this whole thing is something positive that you&#x2019;ll lean on for your whole life.</p>
<p>With all my heart kiddo,<br>I love you,</p>
<p>Dad</p>
<p>PS it doesn&#x2019;t escape me how lucky we are to even be able to have this concern.  I know it&#x2019;s a first world problem to be dealing with a homesick camper when many kids aren&#x2019;t even able to eat.  I&#x2019;m doing my best there too through the Minnow Support Group and spreading the Steem platform which I believe is the strongest force in the world I&#x2019;ve encountered for an abundance mindset in the greater world community.  Here&#x2019;s to all of us being so fortunate to have a homesick camper.</p>

<p>Since I&#x2019;ve been here pharesim has been in the top 20 witnesses.  He&#x2019;s a whale and a Dev and it makes him a good potential candidate.  What I think has helped him excel is his kindness and generosity.  Since the very early days of Minnowsupport he has followed our votes and helped spread just a little bit more cheer to 1500 minnows every day.  This is a very selfless act.  He could be raking in rewards with a big bidbot all to himself, but instead he basically chooses to forego helping himself to help the many.</p>
<p>Someday we all have to realize that in the pursuit of wealth we either live in an endless wheel of always wanting more or staking a flag in the ground, saying we have enough, and helping other people.  Pharesim is one of several whales to do that and one of several witnesses to do that.  There are not too many examples of whale witnesses that approach it this way.</p>
<p>So for your help along the way I say thank you.  For keeping the chain going I say thank you.  For building apps and spreading steem I say thank you.  For spreading your rewards to many I say thank you.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s been an honor to serve along side of you, I&#x2019;ve seen your approach of giving, I have received and will pay it forward, and as you retire your witness I&#x2019;ll be one of many to keep building this beautiful chain.</p>
<p>Namaste brother Pharesim and thank you for your work, your time, your approach, and your kindness.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m not a fancy guy.  My friends who have known me for 30 years call me uncultured.  Apparently citing pathfinder rules doesn&#x2019;t count as &#x201C;culture.&#x201D;  Anyway, @goldmatters sent me a pretty awesome gift.  It&#x2019;s a little sculptured gold.  You can see what he sent and why he sent it in the unboxxing below.  I did this in two takes.  I found the little gold piece, but I didn&#x2019;t realize that there were notes and other pieces to the fancy gift box.  </p>
<p>A couple of things about this.  I honestly did feel like a million bucks opening this.  It&#x2019;s packaged beautifully.  My kids are in the background holding their mouths shut so they don&#x2019;t go dropping a million ooohs and aaaahs.  They were stoked.  I&#x2019;m clearly pleased.  I don&#x2019;t dig on fancy, but this made me think twice about it because the whole experience was quite nice.</p>
<p>The other thing was that a friend of mine growing up had a Picasso in her house.  He was pretty prolific so it&#x2019;s not like those are million dollar pieces, but I&#x2019;ve wanted one since I was in 9th grade.  These pieces are designed by Picasso&#x2019;s grand daughter.  It&#x2019;s a Picasso.  I&#x2019;m not sure that would count for anyone else, but I think it&#x2019;s cool af.</p>

<h2 id="Gold-as-a-business"><a href="#Gold-as-a-business" class="headerlink" title="Gold as a business"></a>Gold as a business</h2><p>It was interesting to talk to @goldmatters some more after this whole thing was sent.  He&#x2019;s working for Mene that&#x2019;s trying to make it easy to use gold as a store of value.  Not just paper gold like what&#x2019;s traded a lot in the USA, but actual real life solid gold that isn&#x2019;t derivatives.  They are also working on crypto storage.  So, I dream of the day that I can convert my Steem at all time highs to Gold to store the value, ride the wave down, and get more Steem after everyone else has panic sold down.  They also have a credit card system, so maybe I can buy some lunch with all this stuff at some point too.</p>

We&#x2019;re trying to make Steem Monsters something that will benefit this whole community.</p>
