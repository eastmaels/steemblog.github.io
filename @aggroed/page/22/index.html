<p>I have mspwaves shows to announce.  I&#x2019;m doing the weekly Town Hall show tonight.  Starts at 8pm (about 1 hours from when this posts).  Standard format.  We&#x2019;ll talk to anyone about anything.  It&#x2019;s been a contentious week so let&#x2019;s talk it through.</p>
<h2 id="Steem-Witness-Forum"><a href="#Steem-Witness-Forum" class="headerlink" title="Steem Witness Forum"></a>Steem Witness Forum</h2><p>It&#x2019;s been a while since I&#x2019;ve done a Steem Witness Forum because of the Holidays.  There will be one this saturday at 10am EST.  All top 20 witnesses are welcome, as are Steemit employees, and I&#x2019;m looking for a 1-2 backup witnesses that would like to come on air.</p>
<h2 id="Steem-Community-Gathering"><a href="#Steem-Community-Gathering" class="headerlink" title="Steem Community Gathering"></a>Steem Community Gathering</h2><p>I want you to mark your calendars.  At 1pm EST on Sunday Feb 3rd I&#x2019;m going to host a community wide open forum.  There&#x2019;s lots of ideas of community governance.  I&#x2019;ve been floating mine around, which I&#x2019;ve called Steem Council, but there are others as well.  I&#x2019;m inviting anyone in the community that wants to share what they are working on, why it has merit, and why we should support it/ use it/ adopt.  I&#x2019;ll try to make sure everyone is given a platform to share.</p>
<h2 id="Logistics"><a href="#Logistics" class="headerlink" title="Logistics"></a>Logistics</h2><p>Shows happen in MSP-waves, which is in <a href="minnowpond.org">PALnet</a>.<br>If you&#x2019;d like to talk on air make sure you have a working mic and the sound isn&#x2019;t going through speakers.<br>Please show up a few minutes early to sound check your mic.</p>
<p>EST +5 is UTC.  Or just ask what time is it in NYC through google.</p>

<p>Ok, getting back to some Steem Monsters action!  We&#x2019;ll be having a Steem Monsters Tournament Tonight.  Starts in 3 hours.  Check in will start 15 min before the show.  The tournament will likely start just after 8pm EST.</p>
<p>I think I&#x2019;m being joined by @isaria and maybe even @swelker101&#x2026; who knows, but someone can join me and we can talk through some matches.</p>
<p><a href="https://challonge.com/1fxdl10j" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://challonge.com/1fxdl10j</a></p>
<p>There&#x2019;s the challonge.  See you in there!</p>
<p>If I can some time I&#x2019;ll try to toss some level 5 commons around to players too that stick around for the show!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hey Ned,</p>
<p>Thanks for going on air these last couple times.  I haven&#x2019;t agreed with all of your statements, but I do have to say you&#x2019;re a lot more natural in this format.  It&#x2019;s a nice first step to show that you are personally making an effort to be more communicative and it&#x2019;s a great way for the community to ask you tough questions so the current rift has a chance of healing.</p>
<h2 id="The-powerdown"><a href="#The-powerdown" class="headerlink" title="The powerdown"></a>The powerdown</h2><p>Recently you started a power down on the @steemit account outside the scope of the standard powerdowns you call  &#x201C;programatic selling.&#x201D;  Normally you power down 800,000 steem a month to sell and use it to pay for expenses.  Now you&#x2019;re powering down 34M steem.  This is the note you left when you initiated that 6 days ago:</p>
<p><code>Moving STEEM to secure wallets. Steemit&apos;s STEEM supports our Mission, Vision and Values which are built on Steem and Steemit.com. Our vision is to grow Steemit.com into a vibrant communities web app, expanding the boundaries of community coordination and online discussion by incorporating cryptocurrencies as incentives. The company focuses on sustainability and decentralization by lowering run costs and increasing revenues by increasing stickiness through better homepage and community tools, and while always demanding a secure and safe, client-side signing experience.</code></p>
<p>One of the central complaints I resonate with and hear frequently is that the 800k steem per month you&#x2019;re spending doesn&#x2019;t seem to help the chain grow.  It  only crashes the price, lowers our rank on CMC, and community investors are getting pummeled by your choices.  It would be one thing if there were more improvements coming and mainstreaming was ongoing, but site usage is down, you sunset the flagship app, and it took a year to build out HF20 at a cost of 10M steem, and we still don&#x2019;t have a great onboarding process.  It&#x2019;s unsustainable and unwise for investors to support this.</p>
<p>Concern has escalated for both Steemit Inc and the Steem Community.</p>
<h2 id="Deescalation"><a href="#Deescalation" class="headerlink" title="Deescalation"></a>Deescalation</h2><p>I get that it started as a knee jerk reaction to johan&#x2019;s pull request and witnesses abandoning an open conversation with you and choosing instead to migrate to a platform where you are absent.  HF21 that your former contractor put together based on HF9 (which was implemented) forks out Steemit&#x2019;s steem.  Couple that with witnesses suddenly abandoning you en masse and I get why you could think it&#x2019;s a cause for concern.  </p>
<p>I can confirm at this point it wasn&#x2019;t a giant conspiracy when it started, but there&#x2019;s a lot more dissent now.</p>
<p>In light of that I&#x2019;d like to try to pull all hands off the BIG RED BUTTON.</p>
<h2 id="Please-stop-the-powerdown"><a href="#Please-stop-the-powerdown" class="headerlink" title="Please stop the powerdown"></a>Please stop the powerdown</h2><p>Ned, I&#x2019;ve said since the very beginning of my journey here that people are the value.  My primary goal is to keep this community as tightly knit as possible.  All the bitcoin forks have siphoned off value from the main chain.  We&#x2019;re on Hardfork 20 and that vast majority have stuck with the primary Steem chain.  My sole intention is to make sure that as much of the Steem family stays on one chain as possible.</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever seen stakeholders so mad as I have for the past few weeks.  It&#x2019;s gotten to what I&#x2019;d call an extreme.  I&#x2019;ve noticed contingents that support a multitude of plans.  Here&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m seeing out there.  These are in chronological order of what various people shared with me.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fork out Steemit accounts</li>
<li>Start a fork of Steem and fork out their accounts on that</li>
<li>Work cooperatively to solve the problem</li>
<li>Status Quo</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#x2019;ll talk through those choices a bit down below, but your choice to powerdown @steemit puts the community that literally despises how you&#x2019;ve behaved, communicated, and how you&#x2019;ve spent the mined stake in an awkward position.  The peaceful resolution that involves forking would be to start a fork of Steem, and remove your presence from that.  I&#x2019;ll call it Neosteem for now.  If you&#x2019;re powering down Steemit and hiding it in exchanges then it jeopardizes the ability of the most outraged to find a peaceful solution that successfully eliminates Steemit from their future.</p>
<p><strong>Your choice to powerdown is literally enhancing their need to leave immediately or fork you out immediately.</strong>  The powerdown is pouring gasoline on the fire.  I&#x2019;m betting and hoping that you haven&#x2019;t considered this aspect.  So, I&#x2019;m presenting it here and asking you to please #stopthepowerdown.  Stopping the power down will let things slow down, cool off, and let calmer heads figure out a mutually agreeable path forward if one exists.</p>
<h2 id="My-pledge"><a href="#My-pledge" class="headerlink" title="My pledge"></a>My pledge</h2><p>If you stop the power down in the very near future and there&#x2019;s still any chance of success of a mutually beneficial way out of this I pledge not to run a hardfork that forks out steemit accounts.</p>
<h2 id="Options-on-the-table"><a href="#Options-on-the-table" class="headerlink" title="Options on the table"></a>Options on the table</h2><p>Option 4.  Status Quo<br>I&#x2019;m absolutely positive that if the status quo remains some of the best witnesses and largest stakeholders will leave Steem.  This is directly against my desire for the chain to stay together.  On top of that I personally can&#x2019;t consent to the way that the mined stake is being used.  It feels like I&#x2019;m growing Steem Monsters in an uphill battle as the price, userbase of steem, and activity on and off the chain has slowed.  I admit some of that is the bear market, but I think Steemit&#x2019;s choices have been critical in how much we&#x2019;re slipping.  I personally really need to see changes happening.  Ned, you&#x2019;re making some good steps towards communications, but that won&#x2019;t go far enough.  If things stay the same this place will fracture, and that&#x2019;s exactly what I&#x2019;m trying to avoid.</p>
<p>Option 2.  Forking Steem without Steemit</p>
<p>I think the most likely scenario if there isn&#x2019;t an accord is people will simply make a fork of steem and not include steemit on that.  In the long term I think it will end up being the more successful fork.  It&#x2019;ll be more decentralized and have a lot of the incredible talent move towards it.  If the current chain does create anything useful it&#x2019;ll be quickly absorbed and then further outpaced than the Steem(it) chain.  In the meantime it&#x2019;ll be shitty as a ton of people walk away, the community is ruptured, and we lose the biggest asset we have (people/community).  This is the exact opposite of keeping the chain together and is my least favorite option (Status quo essentially leads to this).</p>
<p>Option 1.  Fork out Steemit accounts</p>
<p>Forking out Steemit is super contentious and is going to have a shit ton of downfalls.  The votes might not be there to make it happen, though if things spiral more they very well could.  However; Ned might spin up 20 witnesses and vote them in to prevent it.  There&#x2019;s so many nightmare scenarios to choose from!!!</p>
<p>From the perspective of keeping the community together I hate to say it, but this is actually the plan that includes some kind of forking which keeps people in one place the best.  Yes steemit is lost, but steemit is essentially one person with a big stake.  I&#x2019;d rather see that lost than a ton of people and their stake.</p>
<p>Inertia is one of my favorite thought leaders on Steem.  He has stated on multiple occasions that hardforking steemit out is theft to do.  I disagree.  I have the liberty to run whatever code on my witness as I so choose.  As a witness I&#x2019;m elected in part to help create and define consensus.  If the consensus is that Steemit is a bad actor that&#x2019;s hurting us all then I have the right and frankly a responsibility to run code that honors that.  Do I want that?  FUCK NO!  But would I do it to keep the community as a whole if all other options have failed while Steemit was escalating the situation?  Yes I would, and in a fucking heartbeat.  This is my home and I have the will to do what&#x2019;s necessary to defend it.</p>
<p>See, their stake isn&#x2019;t gone.  It&#x2019;s on the chain.  He can run his own version of Steem that includes Steemit&#x2019;s stake by rolling back to a previous spot on the chain.  He could even grant himself more Steem on his very own private Steem island.  But Steemit isn&#x2019;t Steem.  Steem is comprised of thousands of people and I&#x2019;m here to protect their interests more than I am to protect Steemit Inc, which is essentially just Ned, while he consistently makes poor judgments.  </p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t buy the argument forking is theft.  I don&#x2019;t buy the argument it&#x2019;s piracy.  I buy the argument that I get to choose what code to run that will benefit the most stakeholders, which to me is whatever keeps the population of Steemians growing.  It&#x2019;s up to you the steem hodlers on the platform to choose me if they agree.  So far so good :)</p>
<h1 id="Option-3-Working-together-AKA-the-right-plan"><a href="#Option-3-Working-together-AKA-the-right-plan" class="headerlink" title="Option 3.  Working together.  AKA the right plan!"></a>Option 3.  Working together.  AKA the right plan!</h1><p>My ultimate hope and complete attention is on finding a mutually beneficial solution that gets both parties to the promise land of mainstreaming Steem, spreads our values, and let&#x2019;s us benefit from a high token price.</p>
<p>I personally don&#x2019;t care for the language that to me comically amounts to &#x201C;give us the money nedowski or we&#x2019;ll cut off your whale balls.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But I do resonate with something like &#x201C;Stop spending so much money and producing so little of value that you&#x2019;re literally eroding the positive efforts of everyone else working hard to make this place grow.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>I&#x2019;m of the opinion that a community structure could cut costs for ned/steemit, produce more  valuable work (quality and quantity), open up more community development, and engage the community like never before.  So, that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m proposing vis a vis Steem Council.  I&#x2019;m doing what I can to make an outcome where we all benefit rather than all lose.  Here&#x2019;s hoping we find a way!</strong></p>
<h2 id="Our-future-is-in-our-collective-hands"><a href="#Our-future-is-in-our-collective-hands" class="headerlink" title="Our future is in our collective hands"></a>Our future is in our collective hands</h2><p>The best days of the chain may very well be ahead of us or we could be watching the split that kills us.  It&#x2019;s up to all of us, our choices, our voices, and our actions to make the best outcomes possible.  Ned, I hope we can find a collaborative way out of this mess.  </p>
<p>Thank you for your time, thank you for your consideration, and I&#x2019;m committed to doing everything I can to work together,</p>

<p>The Peace Abundance and Liberty Network <a href="minnowpond.org">PALnet</a> is the largest off chain Steem community and we&#x2019;re housed in Discord.  Inside of the Discord channel is a Broadcast station called msp-waves where we host talk and music shows.  I&#x2019;ve hosted a show on msp-waves for over a year called the Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  @llfarms recently joined as co-host.  On this last one we had a pretty large audience and as per usual any member of the audience is welcome to put a &#x201C;1&#x201D; into chat to indicate they would like to go on air.  Tonight I was joined msp-waves station manager @r0nd0n, Minnow Support Project Senior Moderator @clayboyn, dlux founder @disregardingfiat, Steamspeak founder @frystikken, and Steemit CEO @ned joined as well.</p>
<p>Ned chose to come to Discord and this show on his own.  I&#x2019;m grateful that he did and we can start a conversation.  I have a responsibility to the stakeholders here to communicate to the best of my ability the things that I&#x2019;m personally looking for to come out of any discussions between Steemit, the witnesses, large steem power holders, community leaders, and the community at large.  This is my best attempt to do that.  I&#x2019;m doing my best in the following paragraphs to only speak for myself.</p>
<h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>Ned and Dan started a coin.  To act within the law, but circumvent massive regulatory hurdles they decided to launch the coin with public mining rather than an ICO.  They intentionally limited the number of people who could mine by restricting information regarding how to mine the coin in an effort to have the majority stake to then spend it on onboarding and chain development.  Anyone who was an experienced token miner who happened to be following the bitcointalk forums regarding the mining opportunity could setup a miner and go.  So, it was publicly available, but most people couldn&#x2019;t.  I saw Dan (acting as thereverseflash) on bitcointalk seem to help a few miner&#x2019;s who were close, but struggling, but I didn&#x2019;t see any evidence of a tutorial or the like on how to mine.</p>
<p>This system created some distrust of the process because of the exclusivity.  It was made worse when a bug in the code would require a hardfork or a chain restart.  Steemit opted for a restart.  That made a lot of early miners rip shit angry.  They started mining, they put in a lot of energy to make it happen, they had costs, and it seemed like an assault on their coin ownership to simply restart.  An early attitude was &#x201C;Steemit is just going to keep restarting the chain if they don&#x2019;t get the high stake they want.&#x201D;  The &#x201C;ninja mine,&#x201D; the chain restart, and the distribution of Steem (meaning the concentration of steem in the hands of a single entity that can alter chain governance if they choose to vote at any time for witnesses) has lead to low levels of investor confidence in the market.</p>
<p>At the time Dan (thereverseflash) was saying that the mined stake would be used to onboard new users and develop the code for the blockchain.  In the 2017 roadmap it was unilaterally amended and put on the chain as this-  </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmV995HxbUnt1kdN5acNH1voThPjP5SwX7Pup7gvUHZqZh/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As a positive consequence of pre-mine there&#x2019;s a theory that Steem isn&#x2019;t a security, which removes a lot of regulatory challenges.  As negative consequence the distribution was such that Steemit mined close to 75-80% of the steem power.  The remaining Steem went a very narrow group of miners and developers.  To make matters worse the platform had an insane inflation rate.  The amount of steem getting manufactured was enormous and it was stake weighted.  Stake weighted means if you owned steem you got more steem.  The price plummeted, a holders value stayed roughly the same, but the sheer amount of steem grew tremendously.  It led to my comical post of how I made 7 cents in 5 posts.</p>
<h2 id="The-Catalyst"><a href="#The-Catalyst" class="headerlink" title="The Catalyst"></a>The Catalyst</h2><p>There&#x2019;s been a lot of activity recently on the chain and in off chain communications between a variety of community stakeholders.  The powder keg seems to be not just the bear market, but how Steem continues to slip in the rankings on coinmarketcap showing that we&#x2019;re dropping faster than other chains.  Steem has one of if not the largest active community, a fantastic chain, and something like half of the leading Dapps in the cryptosphere, and yet we&#x2019;re in the 50s.  Investors, dapp builders, community leaders, and steem power holders keep telling me things are broken! </p>
<p>This precipitous decline is exasperated by Steemit selling roughly 800,000 steem per month on the market to partially cover operating costs.</p>
<p>The catalyst was when johan, a previous steemit employee and a non-witness, decided to clone steem, create what he called <a href="https://github.com/steemdev/steem/pull/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hardfork 21: Freedom</a> which &#x201C;[if] this hardfork is adopted by witnesses will set all Steemit Inc. controlled accounts authorities to the null key.&#x201D;  It was based on a previous though unimplemented hardfork code change that was written by steemit at a previous time that intended to set authorities to the null key for a different list of accounts.  Steemit has known control over at least 70M steem and there&#x2019;s 292M steem in the world.  So, this hard fork is targeted at 25% of all the known steem power and mentions the accounts owned by steemit exclusively.    </p>
<h2 id="Major-Grievances"><a href="#Major-Grievances" class="headerlink" title="Major Grievances"></a>Major Grievances</h2><p>Ned, here are my major personal concerns.  </p>
<p>I&#x2019;m worried by <strong>financial mismanagement</strong> at Steemit Inc; specifically regarding the use of pre-mined stake.  In 2018 the deliverable put out by Steemit Inc was hardfork 20.  The start of it felt disastrous and more to the point if that&#x2019;s really the only deliverable it cost on the order of 10,000,000 Steem to create and launch HF20 and host steemit.com infrastructure.  That&#x2019;s insanely expensive and I can&#x2019;t support support even a 10th of that cost, especially during the price highs of 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Refusal to communicate and ineffective communication</strong> -  Rare communication from a CTO would be fine.  Rare communication from the CEO and defacto overall community leader is inexcusable.  Particularly, announcing livestreams, abandoning them, and providing no further announcement is flatly unprofessional.  In order to get you to engage it appears there has to be a threat that one of your former employees put on the table to fork out 70M steem.  It shouldn&#x2019;t take that to get you to talk to the people using the tools Steemit creates.</p>
<p><strong>Mass adoption has stalled</strong> -  You built the most commonly used App in the crypto sphere and then sunset it.  HF20 allows for discount account creation tokens, but the flagship app of the platform doesn&#x2019;t let you claim or use them and effectively we&#x2019;re in the same spot as a community where onboarding new users is still a bad and unclear experience.  People are leaving the platform as a whole, not just because of the bear market, but because there&#x2019;s no marketing, the news cycle has been strongly negative about us, investor sentiment is weak, and you seem tone deaf to it all.</p>
<p>&#x201C;<strong>It&#x2019;s open source code with a closed source repository</strong>&#x201C; While the code is open source everything about it feels closed source.  There&#x2019;s almost no insight other than what is put into github, which isn&#x2019;t a place that the vast majority of steemians visit.  There&#x2019;s extremely little communication from the dev team, and my previous experience trying to pry that communication open forces me to interpret it as extreme to the point of xenophobia against non Steemit employees.  We&#x2019;re trying to ask questions and get involved withe the code and changes.  The response is frankly hostility and dismissive.  It would be one thing if development was flying off the shelf.  It&#x2019;s something entirely when deliverables appear infrequently and recent deliverables are met with community dissatisfaction.</p>
<h2 id="Requests-rather-than-Complaints"><a href="#Requests-rather-than-Complaints" class="headerlink" title="Requests rather than Complaints"></a>Requests rather than Complaints</h2><p>I believe strongly in this technology as a way to spread Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  I believe Steem can be the foundation of a better world.  I want to see this be as successful as possible, and that means I want to see Steemit and development here be as successful as possible.  It also means that I&#x2019;m willing to go to extremes to make this project successful.  I&#x2019;ve learned over the years if you want another party to do something the trick is to make it as easy as possible, as clear as possible, and beneficial as possible.</p>
<p>Here are my hopes and requests:</p>
<p><strong>Improved Communication</strong> - As I have been asking for over a year I&#x2019;m again asking for a constant public 2-way town hall style dialogue between you and the community in PALnet, Steamspeak, and other Discord groups where the public frequently congregates.  You said you&#x2019;d bring that up with your team.  I hope it turns into a regular conversation.  I&#x2019;ve already heard concerns that the second you feel you can you&#x2019;ll bail on it that you will.  I urge you to set a time weekly, biweekly, or monthly where you&#x2019;ll field open ended questions from the community just like we did last night.  Then STICK WITH IT!</p>
<p><strong>Structural Change</strong> - I don&#x2019;t think Steemit has the capacity to be both the leading developer of blockchain code and manage all other aspects of the chain.  I think it&#x2019;s better to shift towards a more decentralized model favored by lovers of blockchain technology.  The proposal I&#x2019;ve been floating around can be found <a href="https://hackmd.io/EzrGbFQdQ0yGRtrx4lGQ3w?edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.  I plan to formally put that out into as a proposal this week and have a meeting about it the Feb 2nd at 1pm EST 1800 UTC held in PALnet.</p>
<p>By moving Steem Power from @Steemit to a community managed account and setting up committees I think we can collectively get better, faster, cheaper development and grow this community faster.</p>
<p>Essentially the plan would be to open up governance to anyone in the community that wants to participate.  Form committees with precise operating objectives that have organizational structure needed to be productive, and set an army of Steem community lovers with defined objectives to make change happen.  I think what the anons call &#x201C;mass fuckery&#x201D; will lead us to mass adoption a million times faster than one company acting in competition with it&#x2019;s community ever could.  </p>
<p>In short, I want to see the mined stake and Steemit development efforts merge into community governance while taking things like marketing and business development off of Steemit&#x2019;s plate entirely.</p>
<p>I think when you first reacted to this you thought it excludes you, but I would want you to personally look into that document, see how you could amend it to cooperatively participate.  I don&#x2019;t hate you.  I think you&#x2019;re a little awkward at times, but I think you have an exceptional vision.  I think you&#x2019;re a asset to the community.  Ironically I don&#x2019;t think you see yourself as part of that community.  So, when I say it should be community driven you think &#x201C;but then I&#x2019;m not a part of that.&#x201D;  That has to change.  You&#x2019;re a central part of this community, but we need a different organization to grow.</p>
<p>With structural changes in place I think we can address the remaining components.</p>
<p>We can open up community development to the community and hopefully get new code developed that has had more eyes on it and likely to be less buggy as a result.</p>
<p>I think with a community effort we can spend less money to get more businesses building apps on the chain and more communities forming here, which can help mass adoption.</p>
<p>I think with more people having a say in how the mined stake is spent it&#x2019;s more likely to be spent in a way that this community consents to.</p>
<h2 id="This-is-my-home"><a href="#This-is-my-home" class="headerlink" title="This is my home"></a>This is my home</h2><p>I pledge to work to the best of my ability to bring about a cooperative agreement where this chain and this community can grow and the coin can moon.</p>
<h2 id="Call-to-the-community-this-includes-Steemit-for-action"><a href="#Call-to-the-community-this-includes-Steemit-for-action" class="headerlink" title="Call to the community (this includes Steemit) for action"></a>Call to the community (this includes Steemit) for action</h2><p>Please read this: <a href="https://hackmd.io/EzrGbFQdQ0yGRtrx4lGQ3w?edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://hackmd.io/EzrGbFQdQ0yGRtrx4lGQ3w?edit</a>.  Think about how you can fit into it or what changes you would need to consent to partaking in it.</p>
<p>Join me for a discussion in PALnet on Saturday Feb 2nd at 1pm est 1800 UTC where interested parties can self select to work on various parts of what we need to grow this chain.</p>
<p>Partake in CONSTRUCTIVE conversation about how we can work collectively to moon.  Cause remember&#x2026; WE ALL GO TO THE SAME MOON!</p>
<p>With Love,</p>
<p>Aggroed</p>
