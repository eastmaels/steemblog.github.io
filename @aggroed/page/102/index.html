<h1 id="Lovejuice-Minnow-Promotion"><a href="#Lovejuice-Minnow-Promotion" class="headerlink" title="Lovejuice Minnow Promotion"></a>Lovejuice Minnow Promotion</h1><p>So, I have a bidbot called @lovejuice and a few months ago I started the Lovejuice Minnow Promotion where authors could post through the @lovejuice account and get paid 5 Steem.</p>
<h3 id="2-weeks-ago-I-increased-that-amount-to-20-USD-worth-of-Steem-or-SBD"><a href="#2-weeks-ago-I-increased-that-amount-to-20-USD-worth-of-Steem-or-SBD" class="headerlink" title="2 weeks ago I increased that amount to 20 USD worth of Steem or SBD."></a><strong>2 weeks ago I increased that amount to 20 USD worth of Steem or SBD.</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Why?</em></strong></p>
<p>I started @minnowsupport, aka Minnow Support Project, and the <a href="https://discord.gg/U4qqvTv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palnet Discord</a> with the goal of spreading the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.</p>
<p>The Lovejuice Minnow Promotion is the Abundance aspect of that goal.<br>I want to help as many minnows and new users succeed on this platform as I can while also giving back to the community.  This is also about growing the community.  Having an opportunity to start earning on the platform is a big deal!  As a minnow it&#x2019;s hard to earn anything around here especially as more people come on board and in some ways makes good content and good people discovery harder.</p>
<p>With this I can give back to the community that supports me.  I can make bid bots more expensive to use as I put it on content I think is good.  I can get exposure to new accounts.  And because of bid bots the whole thing is economically sustainable.  It&#x2019;s a good system!</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="Content"><a href="#Content" class="headerlink" title="Content"></a>Content</h1><p>At first I was looking for silly or serious, mild erotica or love stories to match the Lovejuice theme, but now I&#x2019;m ok with just about any type of content.<br>(Within reason! Nothing malicious or hardcore!  As I&#x2019;ve stated before if you&#x2019;re crying because you&#x2019;re ashamed and also still fapping to it there&#x2019;s no way we&#x2019;re gonna post it!)<br>Take a look at the @lovejuice page and check out the posts titled &#x201C;Lovejuice Minnow Promotion&#x201D; to get an idea of what others have posted.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="Promotion"><a href="#Promotion" class="headerlink" title="Promotion"></a>Promotion</h1><p>I don&#x2019;t want to undersell the promotional aspect of this.  You&#x2019;re name goes out to 1600 people while getting paid.  As a minnow the single most important thing you can get is a resteem of your work.  This is similar.  It&#x2019;s not quite as good as a resteem, but I&#x201D;M PAYING YOU TO POST!!!  </p>
<h2 id="What-about-other-languages"><a href="#What-about-other-languages" class="headerlink" title="What about other languages?"></a>What about other languages?</h2><p>I&#x2019;m hoping to build community while here.  If English isn&#x2019;t your first language that&#x2019;s ok.  Put the post in your language and we can try to hack something together using Google Translate to get an English version up underneath your primary language post.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="The-Process"><a href="#The-Process" class="headerlink" title="The Process"></a>The Process</h1><p>Send your original text and photo(s), preferably using <a href="https://hackmd.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://hackmd.io</a>, to @isaria in the <a href="https://discord.gg/U4qqvTv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palnet Discord</a></p>
<p><em>Do not send an already published Steemit post or copied content that you have already published on Steemit!</em></p>
<p>If approved, she will post it through the @lovejuice page and you will receive 20 USD worth of Steem or SBD!</p>
<p>Payments are sent every Sunday.<br>There is currently a 2 week waiting list, but if we get enough submissions we may be able to post 2 a day.</p>

<h2 id="Shameful-Love-Plugs"><a href="#Shameful-Love-Plugs" class="headerlink" title="Shameful Love Plugs"></a>Shameful Love Plugs</h2><ol>
<li><p>This is a bidbot.  If you like the service to minnows this bot is providing please use this bot.  Send a transfer note to @lovejuice with a minimum of 0.1SBD or 0.1Steem.  Use the steembottracker.com website to make sure you&#x2019;re bidding at a good time for a good amount of money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Because I&#x2019;m often hitting these posts with bidbots worth anywhere from 50-250 in post rewards it&#x2019;s actually a pretty good curation investment.  Right now there are only 20-40 people that are catching the curation bonus of 50SBD in bought votes.  Consider actually voting on these minnow posts selfishly for that reason, but also community wise because it will help us expand this out to more users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you&#x2019;d ever like to get some of the benefit of running a bidbot, but don&#x2019;t have the technical means to do it please check out @msp-bidbot.  Every comment it leaves can teach you how to delegate a some steem to that bot and then collect money every day.  If this is the game it&#x2019;s important to me that we all have a level playing field.</p>

<h2 id="I-authored-this-on-mspsteem-com"><a href="#I-authored-this-on-mspsteem-com" class="headerlink" title="I authored this on mspsteem.com"></a>I authored this on mspsteem.com</h2><p>The Minnow Support Project have put together 2 alternate websites to steemit.com.  One is mspsteem.com, which is run by @netuoso.  The other is gosteem.com, which is managed by @followbtcnews, @drakos, and @crimsonclad.  mspsteem has a 5% beneficiary to @minnowsupport, so when people come into our <a href="minnowpond.org">Discord channel Palnet</a> and use the upvote bot it gets stronger over time.  It&#x2019;s crucial to have these because every now and again Steemit.com is slow or not viewable and it&#x2019;s important that we can provide an alternative site.  </p>
<p>We can see the keys that  you use when you do this.  So, you&#x2019;re trusting the witnesses not to steal your money just like you&#x2019;re trusting Steemit not to steal your money when you log into their site.  We always encourage you to use your private posting key and your active key as opposed to your master password when logging in anywhere.  If you don&#x2019;t know the difference come ask some folks in <a href="minnowpond.org">PALnet</a>.</p>

<p>Ok, I have to admit it.  I&#x2019;m a fan.  This lady is pretty awesome.  She&#x2019;s got sass, liberty, peace, and is working on her Steem/crypto chops.  I had a good chance to talk to her for a bit.  She&#x2019;s still a little noobish when it comes to crypto, but she&#x2019;s bright as can be and I suspect she&#x2019;ll be a fast learner.</p>
<p>If you don&#x2019;t know her check out this intro article: <a href="https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@careywedler/i-m-carey-wedler-editor-in-chief-at-the-anti-media-youtube-personality-yoga-teacher-and-activist-i-m-joining-steemit-to-subvert" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@careywedler/i-m-carey-wedler-editor-in-chief-at-the-anti-media-youtube-personality-yoga-teacher-and-activist-i-m-joining-steemit-to-subvert</a></p>
<p>I basically do everything I can to support the charter of the Minnow Support Project.  Spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  Help Steem Grow.  Train and retain minnows on the platform.  Carey is gonna be the trifecta there.  I also talk about supporting people as much as content.  I&#x2019;m personally really excited for her.  I wasn&#x2019;t always woke and I liked Obama for a while.  I even shamefully admit campaigning for him.  Sorry everyone.  Anyway, she was a fan too and when she realized what a bankster loving asshat he was she got ripped and tore him a new one in a piece I think went fairly viral at the time for an Obama sucks kinda post.</p>
<p>So, I&#x2019;ve been following her somewhat for a few years.  She&#x2019;s now on Steemit.  She&#x2019;s cool.  I like her.  She&#x2019;s coming on muh show at 9pm EST this Sunday night 0200 UTC.  So, overall I&#x2019;m pretty stoked for that.</p>
<p>Oh, and she has a following on facebook for like 100k people and another 40k something on youtube.  So, not only does she have the right mindset to be a great fit here, but she&#x2019;s bringing an audience with her to the platform.</p>
<p>So, do yourself a favor and follow @careywedler.</p>
<p>Then come visit the Minnow Mayor Town Hall on this Sunday night 8pm- 11pm (somtimes midnight).</p>

I&#x2019;ll also likely pull the delegations that I have to individuals when I do this, and then switch them to autovotes.</p>

<p>I know, I know.  &#x201C;Aggroed, why are you thanking these people for anything?  They&#x2019;re literally ruining everything they touch, they are a &#x2018;Den of Vipers&#x2019; and some evil human beings.  They created a system that isn&#x2019;t actually broken, but working extremely well to funnel wealth from poor people to the very same bankers you&#x2019;re thanking&#x2026; What&#x2019;s wrong with you?&#x201D;</p>
<h2 id="First-off-it&#x2019;s-a-back-handed-compliment"><a href="#First-off-it&#x2019;s-a-back-handed-compliment" class="headerlink" title="First off, it&#x2019;s a back handed compliment "></a>First off, it&#x2019;s a back handed compliment </h2><h2></h2><p>To be clear I hate bankers.  These people suck.  I don&#x2019;t mean bank tellers, and the poor dopes that have to sell you mortgages.  They&#x2019;re just people&#x2026; but the assholes in charge of this system are amazingly horrible people.  Their primary business is war profiteering and their major export is poverty and political servitude/bribery.</p>
<h2 id="BUT"><a href="#BUT" class="headerlink" title="BUT "></a>BUT </h2><h2></h2><p>If you can read this your life is benefiting from their shittiness.  That&#x2019;s right!  The fact that the government currencies are so bad is part of what&#x2019;s fueling the rise of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>You know how long it takes my bank to clear a check?  Days&#x2026;</p>
<p>You know how long it takes crypto to clear?  Hours&#x2026; unless you&#x2019;re Steem and then it&#x2019;s 3 seconds.</p>
<p>What about inflation?</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re government you&#x2019;re actually racing other currencies to be the fastest inflater.  Apparently that&#x2019;s how you grow an economy as a central banker.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re in the crypto world your coins are deflationary.  This means that if you hold your coins for a year you should be able to purchase more goods and services next year with them then you could today!</p>
<h2 id="Delta"><a href="#Delta" class="headerlink" title="Delta "></a>Delta </h2><h2></h2><p>The real magic is looking at the Delta between these!  Delta is the difference aka you do subtraction.  It&#x2019;s not just that cryptos are deflationary or practically deflationary it&#x2019;s that we&#x2019;re also comparing them to currencies running as fast as they can to inflate.  The difference between those two things is staggering!!!</p>
<h2 id="So-why-are-bitcoin-and-the-altcoins-marching-quickly-up-higher-and-higher-which-gets-you-a-sick-return-on-your-investment"><a href="#So-why-are-bitcoin-and-the-altcoins-marching-quickly-up-higher-and-higher-which-gets-you-a-sick-return-on-your-investment" class="headerlink" title="So, why are bitcoin and the altcoins marching quickly up higher and higher which gets you a sick return on your investment? "></a>So, why are bitcoin and the altcoins marching quickly up higher and higher which gets you a sick return on your investment? </h2><h2></h2><p>When you have funds to invest and you look around your options are hold in cash, which is guaranteed to go down, buy some stocks that may go up a few percent, or pour some cash into cryptos and try to catch some 10x+ returns (sometimes in less than a month).  The positive returns in crypto are only possible because our competition (fiat stuff not other cryptos) is literally the dumbest plan a human could voluntarily choose to do.</p>
<h2 id="The-letter"><a href="#The-letter" class="headerlink" title="The letter "></a>The letter </h2><h2></h2><p>Dear asshat banksters,</p>
<p>You&#x2019;re a gang of criminals and you should all be brought up on charges of treason and Crimes Against Humanity.  You&#x2019;ve created a giant wealth sucking system that has created poverty for millions of people on this planet while simultaneously enriching some of the biggest assholes that ever walked the face of this Earth.  On top of that the amount of fraud you&#x2019;ve embedded in this system is nightmarishly large.  You use violence and deep state spy rings to enforce it.  You are the worst people on the planet.</p>
<p>If there&#x2019;s one thing worth thanking you for it&#x2019;s creating such a horrible situation that out of dire necessity the human mind has created blockchain currencies designed to circumvent your sphere of influence and provide an alternate to the highly inflated pieces of fiat dog shit you call your currency.  Blockchain is cool and it wouldn&#x2019;t exist if you weren&#x2019;t all the horrendous ass eating vultures that purposefully rob economies all over the world.</p>
<p>There will come a time in the not too distant future your crimes are exposed for the harm they cause and the collective will of the people on this planet will see an end to the suffering you cause with your economic strife and military weapons.  Until then, keep building your bunkers and planning for the apocalypse.   We the people, particularly those of the internet, are coming.  Your days are numbered.</p>
<p>Many blessings of genital herpes,<br>yours truly,</p>
<p>Aggroed</p>

<p>I was reminded just the other day when Steem breached $8 USD that at one point I had written about being a Steemit Millionaire.  <a href="https://steemit.com/drugs/@aggroed/how-i-became-the-first-steemitmillionaire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It</a> was one of the very first posts I ever made.  It was actually a challenge to find it because you can&#x2019;t scroll back in condenser far enough.  So, I dug in through steemd.com/@aggroed and found this baby.</p>
<p>Now remember I didn&#x2019;t start on this platform as the useful person you know me as now.  It took a while for a love of this place to kick in, but again for some important and life altering reason $8 Steem reminded me of that post.  There&#x2019;s no way I&#x2019;d imagine the story ark I&#x2019;ve been on for the last 3 years, but it&#x2019;s been pretty amazing.  I&#x2019;m not sure I can tell everyone it&#x2019;s bound to happen to them.  That&#x2019;s probably not the case, but I do think that Steem can pay off in spades if you stick with it.</p>
<p><a href="http://theinterrobang.com/bo-burnham-tells-young-people-quit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bo Burnham tells it better than me</a></p>
<p>I dreamed about that million.  I was envious when @trafalgar wrote <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@trafalgar/3-months-1000-followers-and-usd1-million-later" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about it</a>.  Pretty amazing watching this place blow up!</p>
<h2 id="7-cents-in-5-posts"><a href="#7-cents-in-5-posts" class="headerlink" title="7 cents in 5 posts "></a>7 cents in 5 posts </h2><h2></h2><p>I see some minnows who are new to the platform that are upset that their content is only earning a handful of sbds when they post.  It&#x2019;s hard to keep perspective on that.  It&#x2019;s like listening to my now deceased grandfather about living through WWII and the shortages of everything.  I mean, this is only 1 year ago, but again, internet time is like dog years on steroids.  So, here&#x2019;s a throw back post about <a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@aggroed/how-i-made-usd0-07-cents-in-5-posts-and-how-you-can-too" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how I made 7 cents in 5 posts</a>.  If you think it&#x2019;s hard now you can&#x2019;t imagine how hard it was to get started under free for all exponential rewards and a terrible distribution.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Back in my day we didn&#x2019;t have linear rewards you ungrateful shit.  We had to earn Steem by fondling whale balls every second of the day because we couldn&#x2019;t upvote worth shit.  You know how long it took me to get to a 2 cent vote?  6 MONTHS!  Fucking 6 MONTHS!  Here&#x2019;s the <a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@aggroed/you-know-you-made-it-on-steemit-when" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> I made celebrating that fucking milestone.  You god damned kids!  GET OFF MUH STEEM!!!&#x201D;</p>
<h2 id="stellabelle"><a href="#stellabelle" class="headerlink" title="@stellabelle "></a>@stellabelle </h2><h2></h2><p>One lady I like quite a lot on the platform is Stella.  She&#x2019;s old school as far as Steem goes.  I like her vision of a tribal gift economy.  It sounds so much better than the shit fiat world we live in now.  Some people aren&#x2019;t giant fans of hers, but I&#x2019;ve always liked her.  I mean that literally.  Check out my steemd.com/@aggroed.  The very literal first thing I ever did on Steem was follow her!</p>

Spend a life in crypto.  I think there&#x2019;s life and happiness to be had there.  Also as a teaser to my next post I&#x2019;d like to thank the central bankers of the world for being such terrible shitty economy riggers&#x2026; I&#x2019;ll explain later.</p>

<h2 id="New-Users"><a href="#New-Users" class="headerlink" title="New Users "></a>New Users </h2><h2></h2><p>So, if you don&#x2019;t know me.  I&#x2019;m Aggroed.  It&#x2019;s a pleasure to meet you.  I&#x2019;m a PhD Chemist by formal training.  I just quit my job and I&#x2019;m working in Cryptoland full time.  My major responsibility is fulfilling the charter of the Minnow Support Project (@minnowsupport) which I helped found with @teamsteem, @ausbitbank, and @canadian-coconut.  The goals of the project are to spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, to grow the Steem ecosystem, and to help train and retain minnows (new users).</p>
<p>At the moment the primary account @minnowsupport sits at 85k Steem Power.  We use that to provide free upvotes to users.  Come join us in <a href="minnowpond.org">Discord</a> and after you register we let anyone use the community account to upvote their posts twice a day.  It&#x2019;s not a ton of money since more than 1,000 people use it every day, but it&#x2019;s a great start on the platform and can help you get off on the right foot.</p>
<h2 id="Community"><a href="#Community" class="headerlink" title="Community "></a>Community </h2><h2></h2><p>More important than a little bit of money on your posts is the community that you can find in the <a href="minnowpond.org">PALnet Discord Channel</a>.  We&#x2019;re over 7,000 Steemians now.  These are people that can be your friend, your translator, your teacher, your business partner, your makeout partner, your w/e.  It&#x2019;s a lot of people tied to the Steem community and crypto in general.  That&#x2019;s crucial because it&#x2019;s the number one  thing that will determine your success here.</p>

Maybe you&#x2019;re lucky and catch some nice upvote or something, but largely when you&#x2019;re a brand new user your content has less than 1% chance of standing out.  So, if you like writing go ahead.  If it&#x2019;s fun WOOT, but don&#x2019;t expect to get loaded from it if that&#x2019;s how you&#x2019;re starting.</p>

The best way to have that happen is to start by commenting on other people&#x2019;s posts and making friends in Discord.  I&#x2019;m not talking about f4f or that sorta shit.  I&#x2019;m talking about leaving good comments, starting healthy conversation, maybe even helping other people with your special skills, and gaining a loyal following from that.  </p>
<p>The single most useful thing on the platform is a high SP account that really values your content, but it&#x2019;s hard to get noticed, so you have to build up your following over time.  The best way to do that is actually through commenting.  if you&#x2019;re brand new here write up some really short form content and make some introductions, but 80% of your time should be finding content that you like and writing authentic comments on it.  First, the upvotes you get are likely to be worth more than than you get on your posts, and second it&#x2019;s likely you&#x2019;ll get a follower.   This is especially true if you stick with it a little bit.  @spendorhub is a good example of this on my previous posts and as you might notice it might just get you a nice mention in the middle of a post.</p>
<h2 id="Comment-a-lot-author-briefly&#x2026;-what-else"><a href="#Comment-a-lot-author-briefly&#x2026;-what-else" class="headerlink" title="Comment a lot, author briefly&#x2026; what else? "></a>Comment a lot, author briefly&#x2026; what else? </h2><h2></h2><p>Be patient.  It takes time to start a new business and make it into something.  If you&#x2019;re not bringing in an audience or following or fame from something else.  You&#x2019;re just some dude or lady on the platform then you have to be patient.  This place takes time.  Folks are interested in supporting good people, and there&#x2019;s definately some feeling of &#x201C;you have to pay your dues.&#x201D;  So, don&#x2019;t expect it all to come right away.   </p>
<p>Growth here is non linear.  It happens in spurts.    So, you&#x2019;re posting away and no one cares for a while.  You make less than a buck, but somehow a whale happens to catch it and you get hit with an upvote or resteem.  Then you catch some followers and have a little spurt.  That doesn&#x2019;t happen if you aren&#x2019;t consistant.</p>
<h2 id="Don&#x2019;t-be-an-asshole"><a href="#Don&#x2019;t-be-an-asshole" class="headerlink" title="Don&#x2019;t be an asshole "></a>Don&#x2019;t be an asshole </h2><h2></h2><p>The urge of everyone is to be as selfish as possible when they get to Steem.  I&#x2019;d highly encourage you not to be.  Try to think about how you can help other people.  Do that a lot and you&#x2019;ll earn a lot.  If you spend most of your time thinking about how you can simply enrich yourself it likely won&#x2019;t get you far.  There are some notable examples otherwise&#x2026; but if you&#x2019;re going to be an asshole you better be really fucking entertaining cause this platform doesn&#x2019;t respond well to it in general.</p>
<h2 id="Find-a-model"><a href="#Find-a-model" class="headerlink" title="Find a model "></a>Find a model </h2><h2></h2><p>Honestly, after 1.5 years here I still think that @kaylinart is the <del>gold</del> bitcoin standard of what a good Steemian looks like.  She posts well.  It&#x2019;s thoughtful.  It looks pretty.  She&#x2019;s charming as hell.  She interacts with her followers really well.  She&#x2019;s my goto.  There are some other good examples of this and others will have more specific interests or are more camera happy, but the point is find someone doing something that&#x2019;s working and try to mimic it to the best of your ability with your own flare.</p>
<h2 id="Don&#x2019;t-rage-and-do-ask-for-help"><a href="#Don&#x2019;t-rage-and-do-ask-for-help" class="headerlink" title="Don&#x2019;t rage and do ask for help "></a>Don&#x2019;t rage and do ask for help </h2><h2></h2><p>Lastly, don&#x2019;t go full rage quit when things don&#x2019;t work out.  That usually happens cause you catch a flag and your first instinct is to go ballistic.  Don&#x2019;t be like that.  Try to avoid being an asshole for a while and you should be able to dodge most of that, but if you do happen to get embroiled like this then don&#x2019;t get lost in a fight here.  Just chill, try to deescalate, and find something else to talk about.</p>
<p>If you are stuck find some people to help you.  You may need language help.  Tech help.  IDK, this place is complicated so there&#x2019;s lots that you might need.  Ask for help.  If you&#x2019;re feeling frustrated then try to relax and let&#x2019;s see if some folks can help.  Anyway(s), it&#x2019;s nice to meet you.  It took me 8 months to get anywhere on this platform and now my goal is to help new people do it faster than that.  Here&#x2019;s wishing you many blessings of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty and much success on the platform!</p>
<h2 id="PS"><a href="#PS" class="headerlink" title="PS "></a>PS </h2><h2></h2><p>This may be neat and cool and brand new for you, but Steem and Discord is <em>home</em> for a lot of people.  It may end up being your home too.  It&#x2019;s hard to see that on day 1, but Steem is a pretty incredible place.  Try to treat it with some respect.  We&#x2019;ve built something pretty awesome that you&#x2019;re now stepping into.  If you want the community to embrace you then it&#x2019;s best if you honor the space you&#x2019;re in.</p>

<h3 id="Recognize"><a href="#Recognize" class="headerlink" title="Recognize"></a>Recognize</h3><p>The first step is to be able to recognize it in the first place.<br>Passive Aggressive behavior is deliberate and a form of manipulation. The behavior purposely sends mixed messages that can be confusing.  Trust your instincts.  If you feel that someone is being passive aggressive then they probably are.<br><a href="https://hackmd.io/KYBgrAzFIgtAnBAhnALPA7BWAOAxgGYAmuRIERATAGzUYEECMQA=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My last post about passive aggressive behavior</a> gave some great examples to help you to recognize this behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#x2019;s a quick review:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Someone who insists they are fine even though they are clearly angry</li>
<li>The silent treatment</li>
<li>Agreeing to a task, but acting sullen and hostile while doing it</li>
<li>Procrastination</li>
<li>Pretending not to hear a request</li>
<li>Using manipulation instead of assertive communication</li>
<li>Deliberately acting in passive aggressive ways in order to incite anger in another person</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Openly-Acknowledge-Their-Anger"><a href="#Openly-Acknowledge-Their-Anger" class="headerlink" title="Openly Acknowledge Their Anger"></a>Openly Acknowledge Their Anger</h3><p>Stop walking on eggshells and point out the elephant in the room!<br>Passive aggressive people refuse to acknowledge their anger and try to keep it underneath the surface.  The best way to deal with it is to acknowledge the existence of their anger in a non critical way.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Disengage"><a href="#Disengage" class="headerlink" title="Disengage"></a>Disengage</h3><p>Sometimes people engage in passive aggressive behavior with the specific intention of angering others.<br>You need to be able to manage your emotions and make the choice not to engage in what is essentially a deliberate power struggle.<br>This will help to de-escalate the situation and ultimately bring you peace.</p>
