<p>While walking the streets of NYC on a busy friday afternoon I was able to catch up with legendary digital kitten vendor Vitalik Buterin while he was handing out free Lambos and digital cats.</p>
<p>@aggroed- Excuse me Vitalik?</p>
<p>Vitalik- Yes?</p>
<p>@aggroed- You&#x2019;re the digital cat guy right?</p>
<p>Vitalik- Well, no, I&#x2019;m the founder of the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>@aggroed- Oh, but you&#x2019;re the guy selling the cats?</p>
<p>Vitalik - No, that&#x2019;s cryptokittens.  One just sold for $125k USD you know&#x2026;</p>
<p>@aggroed- Right, but those are on your network?</p>
<p>Vitalik - Yes, there are many of them and they are everywhere.</p>
<p>@aggroed - great.  So, you&#x2019;ll have to do.  How&#x2019;s the kitten business?</p>
<p>Vitalik - Well, I&#x2019;ll tell you, it&#x2019;s so popular that it&#x2019;s actually cause slight problems in the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>@aggroed - How so?</p>
<p>Vitalik -  Well, Ethereum can only handle so many transactions per day.  Actually we&#x2019;re at max capacity already.  We have on the office white board a new term: KPS.  It stands for kittens per second, and right now we&#x2019;re maxed out at our kitten capacity.  So every transaction going forward is going to get more expensive and you&#x2019;ll need more gas to actually get things through faster, but even with that we can&#x2019;t keep up with these fucking cats.  I&#x2019;m nervous where this is going with even more kittens coming from the digital factory.</p>
<p>@aggroed- How is this going to effect my kitten investments?  I&#x2019;m planning on trading roughly 8000 kittens a day myself.</p>
<p>Vitalik - Well, you must have already seen the tweet by crypto kittens that the price is going up to even get them.  I think the price will have to keep rising, because if they leave the price as $25 USD it will make our network crawl.  Like a little itty bitty cute and cudly kitten.</p>
<p>@aggroed - just how big of a deal is this?</p>
<p>Vitalik.  Well did you see this recent tweet?</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmWWt1CY6zEkzfuUW2h7hLtYzr4vCJk23GSf7Fu9H3VTM4/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These cats make up 25% of all network transactions right now.  For the moment I&#x2019;m happy, but sometimes I do wonder what will happen if crypto dogs comes along.  I mean, we&#x2019;re over capacity as it is.  The network literally can&#x2019;t handle this many transaction already.  cryptodog, cryptosloths, cryptomilfs&#x2026; as they expand this business we have literally no transactional room to expand&#x2026;. fuck&#x2026; I should probably call that asshole @dan to figure out what to do.</p>
<p>@aggroed - Oh, I saw a recent price trend.  How do you think investors are responding.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmTLp3SE7UdxsRAxtsdzuUGe4AjssCytkVoSyodwb5tAs1/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Vitalik- Go fuck yourself.</p>
<p>@aggroed - I take it no free Lambos for me today?</p>
<p>For whatever reason the interview ended abruptly, but rest assured more cats are coming and the world waits for ethereum&#x2019;s solution to it.</p>

            <p>BOOM!  Steem is gonna moon even before SMTs and Communities, and I just received my 2500th witness vote!!  It&#x2019;s a good fucking day.  </p>

<p>I couldn&#x2019;t be happier than to be building the Steem ecosystem!  We&#x2019;ll start the new year at $5/steem and we&#x2019;ll end it past $50.  These things are exponential.  We added an exchange thanks in large part to @clayop and @slowwalker building the Korean community.  It&#x2019;s spiking the price.  We&#x2019;re going to see a rise in content creators and many will want to purchase steem.  It&#x2019;s going to continue increasing in price and as it increases in price more people are going to come in.  Like all cryptos we&#x2019;ll have our dips, but I think our price rut at $0.8-1.1 is over for a long while.  I think we&#x2019;re in the next expansion round.  So, for god&#x2019;s sake hodl!</p>

"></a>You&#x2019;re in the right spot.  </h2><h2></h2><p>You see the kitty story on @steemitblog?  Ethereum is over there talking shit about EOS (he made a joke of EOS being Eth 2.0), but who is laughing now?  They hit peak transactions.  They&#x2019;re sitting on 21k unprocessed transactions&#x2026; how the fuck are you gonna tokenize the internet if you can&#x2019;t handle a few thousand kitty contracts?</p>
<p>Steem can handle orders of magnitude more transactions per second than eth can.  You want an internet worth of transactions?  You want them processed in 3 seconds?  Then I got a coin for you my friend.</p>
<p>@stan recently made a post about how all these devs are dying to make bitcoin apps cause the price is so hawt right now, but they can process 7 tx per second.  SEVEN!!!  That&#x2019;s it.  People are gonna figure out that Steem Dollars and Steem can do the same shit as bitcoin now and the same as eth in about 3 months, but we can do it more, faster, better, and with names instead of 253245lk43jh234k5jhlasdfahsj234 as your account number</p>
<p>You&#x2019;re in the right coin.  Just fucking HODL and laugh your ass off a year from now!  I didn&#x2019;t know what this place really offered when I started, but I&#x2019;m so glad I came here!</p>

All I knew is that I was sick and tired of Facebook booting my account because I was a political activist who didn&#x2019;t like what the government was doing.  They didn&#x2019;t just do it once.  They kicked me off five times after I kept rebuilding an account up to 2k followers.  It was that fifth time when I read about Steem and I jumped ship.</p>

You&#x2019;re gonna have claw my steem power from my cold dead hands.  This place is incredible.  You can create abundance at a click, this place teaches peace because negative behavior has negative consequences, and it supports free speech with a reasonable amount of input from the community to shut some people up.</p>
<p>The world is so broken from war, poverty, and a giant spy net, but Steem stands as a counter vision against that.  This is how we can have nice things without constant war, scarcity, or taxation at every step.</p>

It&#x2019;s gonna be slow as shit.  It&#x2019;s gonna be used nearly entirely to fund a military budget.  It&#x2019;s gonna be loaded with a debt it can&#x2019;t pay.  It&#x2019;s gonna have a million ID restrictions.  I could go on&#x2026;</p>
<p>Steem is the next evolution.  Write, Post, Earn. Be free.  Where else can you find that?!?</p>
<h2 id="Stay-the-Course"><a href="#Stay-the-Course" class="headerlink" title="Stay the Course! "></a>Stay the Course! </h2><h2></h2><p>Spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  Help grow the platform.  Help train and retain minnows on the platform.</p>
<p>My next short term project is to empower some Minnow Support Project curators to help get minnows off the ground: <a href="https://steemit.com/minnowsupportproject/@minnowsupport/the-minnow-support-project-proudly-announces-our-newest-curation-effort-msp-curation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/minnowsupportproject/@minnowsupport/the-minnow-support-project-proudly-announces-our-newest-curation-effort-msp-curation</a>.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning I&#x2019;ll delegate 2,500 SP (get it 2,500 witness votes so 2500 SP) to @msp-curation, and hopefully by the end of December I&#x2019;ll be up to 10k!</p>

<p>If you want steem to grow people need to see this place.  Please take 5 min and hook steem up to other social media automagically.</p>

<p>So, I&#x2019;m staring in awe about how steem fortunes seem to have changed simply by the addition of the Korean exchange as noted by @acidyo here: <a href="https://steemit.com/exchange/@acidyo/upbit-recently-listed-steem-krw-and-sbd-krw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/exchange/@acidyo/upbit-recently-listed-steem-krw-and-sbd-krw</a>.</p>
<h2 id="It-was-an-immediate-overnight-success"><a href="#It-was-an-immediate-overnight-success" class="headerlink" title="It was an immediate overnight success! "></a>It was an immediate overnight success! </h2><h2></h2><p> or was it?</p>
<p>The whole thing takes a massive community building effort.  The Koreans on the platform make up roughly 6 percent of the activity on the platform.  That didn&#x2019;t just happen.  It happens through community building and ensuring a portion of rewards goes to a segment of the population such that they experience some success.  The overnight success was really a 1-2 year saga about building a Korean community on the Steem block chain.  It appears to me to have been spear headed by @slowwalker and @clayop.  I wrote a brief thank you note, but I really want to hone in how important getting that exchange on board and building the community behind that which made us all richer and more successful.  </p>
<h2 id="Witnesses-come-in-two-flavors"><a href="#Witnesses-come-in-two-flavors" class="headerlink" title="Witnesses come in two flavors "></a>Witnesses come in two flavors </h2><h2></h2><p>I often talk about two types of witnesses: programmers and social.  The social folks are those that build communities.  I started off in Frystikken&#x2019;s steemspeak.  I interacted in Fuzzy&#x2019;s whaleshares.  I figured out that building community is central to the needs of the platform.  Those communities start off generally as a bunch of riff raff trying to pull their shit together or just clowning around on the internet, but eventually ties start to form, plans get made, tools get built, friends get called in, buzz gets created, an exchange adds our token, and suddenly the Koreans are purchasing $8M worth of Steem.</p>

<h2 id="Good-content-is-subjective"><a href="#Good-content-is-subjective" class="headerlink" title="Good content is subjective "></a>Good content is subjective </h2><h2></h2><p>I keep hearing that &#x201C;90% of Steem is spam&#x201D; from people.  I think it just really means that 90% of posts aren&#x2019;t what I&#x2019;m interested in.  &#x201C;Content is bad here&#x2026;&#x201D; I mean, I find plenty of shit that I like when I have time to read it.  Trending might be a little wonky frequently, but you can find good articles, and entertaining reads.  I haven&#x2019;t once looked back at Facebook thinking, oh I really miss that place and all the amazing content.  It was 90% shit I don&#x2019;t care about or more.  I think it really just has to do with we are really only interested in super focused things.  Until you join the perfect community made of perfectly like minded people and you&#x2019;re all sharing a community feed I think you&#x2019;re gonna be stuck wading throuh stu you don&#x2019;t like.  So, I&#x2019;m not seeing the same lack of good content others are&#x2026; I just don&#x2019;t think a blogging platform geared for the whole world is focused on exactly on what I want nor should it be.</p>
<p>To get a good news feed from Facebook I would follow all the people that I found had content that I liked and then literally sit there for hours trying to find the articles that appealed to me.  Steem is no different in that regard.  You gotta work to find the content that appeals directly to you&#x2026; now yeah, we&#x2019;re missing a real search feature on the block, but I&#x2019;m betting utopian can fix that before long.</p>
<h2 id="We-need-more-audience"><a href="#We-need-more-audience" class="headerlink" title="We need more audience "></a>We need more audience </h2><h2></h2><p>I think we are missing some audience though.  I have a friend who is a painter.  She writes about painting on a painting specific community posting board.  She gets thousands of views&#x2026; she doesn&#x2019;t make any money, but she gets thousands of views.  I think we have to find better ways to engage our audience and pull people here.  That&#x2019;s where the recent post by @bex-dk is critical that talks about adding value with our work and also @roxane who talked about a way to force Steemit to feed your other social media.</p>
<p> <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@bex-dk/adding-value-to-steemit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/steemit/@bex-dk/adding-value-to-steemit</a><br><a href="https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@roxane/how-do-you-automatically-publish-your-steemit-posts-on-your-social-networks-with-zapier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@roxane/how-do-you-automatically-publish-your-steemit-posts-on-your-social-networks-with-zapier</a></p>
<p>This audience isn&#x2019;t gonna magically appear.  We all have to work to build it, and I&#x2019;ll get to work on that zapier thing to push my content to my other shitty sites.</p>
<h2 id="&#x201C;Steemit-looks-ugly&#x201D;"><a href="#&#x201C;Steemit-looks-ugly&#x201D;" class="headerlink" title="&#x201C;Steemit looks ugly&#x201D; "></a>&#x201C;Steemit looks ugly&#x201D; </h2><h2></h2><p>As for Steem and the steemit.com interface known as <code>condenser</code> there&#x2019;s always going to be something else it needs.  There&#x2019;s not going to be one solution that solves all the needs for all the people.  Eventually we&#x2019;re going to have to have 60 skins like Nightmode, but different layouts for people with different interests.  You&#x2019;ll get your chainbb flavor, busy flavor, dmania flavor, and a million other flavors because people don&#x2019;t want the same thing.  So, one man&#x2019;s perfect website is another man&#x2019;s shithole.  What I&#x2019;m saying that a perfect steemit.com website is subjective too.</p>
<h2 id="We-need-people"><a href="#We-need-people" class="headerlink" title="We need people "></a>We need people </h2><h2></h2><p>The one thing that isn&#x2019;t subjective is that if we want Steem to grow we need more people.  It&#x2019;s that simple.  We need some folks focused on pulling in organizations, schools, churches, classes, businesses and friends.  That&#x2019;s what will make this place have more content in the flavors you want, more tools to do the thing you need, and more value because more goods and services will be produced on a platform that has negligible inflation (compared to fiat).</p>
<h2 id="So-ask-what-can-you-do-to-build-a-community"><a href="#So-ask-what-can-you-do-to-build-a-community" class="headerlink" title="So, ask what can you do to build a community! "></a>So, ask what can you do to build a community! </h2><h2></h2><p>Because if you find an answer that works we&#x2019;ll have the people to solve the other problems and you&#x2019;ll get rewarded because most people know this place has to grow.  In the meantime try not to be dicks to one another, especially new users&#x2026; we need them!  And if you happen to see some great community builders then try to help them out cause they&#x2019;re lifting up the whole platform.</p>

<p>Bittrex: USD/STEEM: $1.4890; USD/SBD: $2.8976<br>Poloniex: USD/STEEM: $1.4274; USD/SBD: $2.5568<br>Bittrex: USD/GOLOS: $0.1614; USD/GBG: $0.1428</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t know who on the platform still has some SBDs handy, but this is pretty wild to watch.  Prices are spiking.  I think @acidyo called it when he published how a Korean exchange is now listing Steem and people can buy it straight from fiat.  It&#x2019;s pumping the price of sbds and it&#x2019;s raised the price of steem seemingly by 60 cents preactically overnight.</p>

"></a>What&#x2019;s @clayop have to do with this? </h2><h2></h2><p>Community building is important.  Steem is only as strong as the number of people engaged in this place, and that means growing communities.  @clayop is basically a 1 man army helping to grow the Korean community.  He&#x2019;s a curator, a leader, and a top witness helping to promote us in Korea.  We wouldn&#x2019;t be having this success without him and his work, so thanks @clayop.</p>

<p>MSP3k-  Communities isn&#x2019;t here yet, but the closest thing to community curation on the block right now is msp3k.  If you have a team of curators looking to share a single account we can help with a free tool that lets you share an account without having to share the keys.  Upvote, post, and resteem all from 1 place!  @netuoso won the first MSP Medal of Honor for it&#x2019;s creation!!!</p>
<p>Vote Delegation Helper:  Man, I hate the name.  I like the name msp-toolbox, but whatever.  This program created by @followbtcnews and @crimsonclad (the witness is @followbtcnews) allows people to delegate to a central account and receive automatic votes from it.  It&#x2019;s designed to help build a community account and incentivize people to delegate into that community account.  It&#x2019;s also a free tool that the Minnow Support Project leadership can help you setup.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve been on Steem for over a year.  I&#x2019;ve been watching the development of the platform.  I&#x2019;m seeing SMTs coming out soon and communities.  I&#x2019;m hosting some nice groups on mspwaves.com (search trending for the latest).  I have good things going on, but I don&#x2019;t frequently talk about curators.  I&#x2019;ve had to have a lot of discussion around curation lately as talking about bid bots seems to naturally segway into a discussion of curation, curation rules, and curators.</p>
<h2 id="Curation-is-really-hard-to-do-well"><a href="#Curation-is-really-hard-to-do-well" class="headerlink" title="Curation is really hard to do well "></a>Curation is really hard to do well </h2><h2></h2><p>If you look at my wallet you&#x2019;ll notice I have 56k Steem Power and Delegate out about 55kSP.  That&#x2019;s all going to things I believe help new users on this platform be successful to fulfill my Witness mission and charter of the Minnow Support Project of helping spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, help Steem grow, and train and retain new users on teh platform, but that&#x2019;s not the only reason that I do it.  The other reason is that good curation takes an assload of time and is hard to do well.  You have to read hours of material and if you have a large stake you&#x2019;re constantly going back and forth between thinking of what is best for curation rewards and what is best for the platform.  It&#x2019;s just really hard to do well and takes forever.  So, I wanted to give a shoutout to some individuals that do a really freaking good job at this (and who have some pretty hefty balances such that their curation efforts make a big dent too).</p>
<h2 id="acidyo"><a href="#acidyo" class="headerlink" title="@acidyo "></a>@acidyo </h2><h2></h2><p>As much as I rib him on his wall or in steemit chat or Discord I have enormous respect for this guy.  I think he reads more articles in a day than every employee at Steemit combined.  He&#x2019;s always around, he&#x2019;s always reading, and not only does he curate himself he&#x2019;s inspried a whole group of curators called OCD.  You don&#x2019;t have to go far to see his fingerprints on the chain just pick a post at random and he&#x2019;s probably read it and commented on it.  He&#x2019;s a role model for all Steemians to follow and I&#x2019;m proud to call him friend.</p>
<h2 id="ausbitbank"><a href="#ausbitbank" class="headerlink" title="@ausbitbank "></a>@ausbitbank </h2><h2></h2><p>He&#x2019;s the cofounder of the Minnow Support Project, a talented dev, a little shy, and bright as a whip.  He&#x2019;s using a combination of manual and automatic curation to effective hit hundreds of posts and authors every week.  His work ethic is nothing short of fantastic, and he seems to have the best intentions of this platform in mind as he&#x2019;s curating.  There&#x2019;s hardly a minnow in the pond that hasn&#x2019;t received a vote from @ausbitbank.  He&#x2019;s thoughtful, kind, and has a pretty exacting method that he applies to make curation happen.  If you don&#x2019;t know he&#x2019;s a witness and you can and should vote for him!</p>
<h2 id="canadian-coconut"><a href="#canadian-coconut" class="headerlink" title="@canadian-coconut "></a>@canadian-coconut </h2><h2></h2><p>This lady likes to hit some posts pretty hard.  She has a range of interests including homeschooling, alternative education, western medicine safety concerns, and most recently trying to help families in duress.  She&#x2019;s a voracious reader and a wealth of knowledge.  She&#x2019;s kind hearted and has shared multiple stories of taking people into her home and trying to get them back on her feet.  She&#x2019;s a mother and she&#x2019;s been my friend on this platform practically since the day I started on it.  When she&#x2019;s not hitting posts with some mega ups she&#x2019;s also curating a ton of minnows in the pond.  Many of you may not realize that despite not taking a highly vocal role in MSP operations nearly half of everyone tagged as registered with the bots was tagged by ca-co as she silently lead her quest to help organize the Minnow Support Project (much needed because it&#x2019;s not always my strong suit).</p>
<h2 id="thejohalfiles"><a href="#thejohalfiles" class="headerlink" title="@thejohalfiles "></a>@thejohalfiles </h2><h2></h2><p>This guy is amazing.  I see him touching posts from the smallest minnow the biggest whales.  He&#x2019;s a one man army ensuring high quality content has whale support, and seems to take a deep interest in making sure good authors are rewarded on the platform.  I don&#x2019;t have much more to say because he&#x2019;s one of the most hidden whales on the platform, but I think of him as a friend, and am grateful for the support he&#x2019;s given to me personally and many of the minnows in the pond.</p>
<h2 id="teamsteem"><a href="#teamsteem" class="headerlink" title="@teamsteem "></a>@teamsteem </h2><h2></h2><p>Who doesn&#x2019;t know @teamsteem?  He&#x2019;s one of the original founders of the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network.  His French Canadian accent is immediately recognizable as well as his face and love of mangos.  He&#x2019;s funny, charming, friendly, a growing presence with the Minnow Support Project, and one of the best curators on the chain.  You can find him in multiple discord channels socializing and spreading good will for our Steem blockchain.  He uses his steem power to help high quality content and high quality people from minnows to whales.  Like @ausbitbank he&#x2019;s using a combination of automatic votes and manual curation to be highly effective reaching a large number of people.  I&#x2019;m proud to call him friend and thankful for his work.</p>
<h2 id="honorable-mentions"><a href="#honorable-mentions" class="headerlink" title="honorable mentions "></a>honorable mentions </h2><h2></h2><p>@gmuxx-  This guy has been talking about minnow posts through muxxy bot for a while.  He&#x2019;s a charming brit and if he had a little more Steem Power he&#x2019;d be on the above list without question.</p>
<p>@berniesanders- For a while he was using the majority of his steem power to run engagement which was curating the shit out of this place.  If you were here as far back as 6 months ago you&#x2019;ve highly likely gotten a vote from them and didn&#x2019;t even know that it was bernie helping your ass out.  He&#x2019;s got his fingerprints all over the blockchain.  The only thing that keeps him out of my top five is his flagging.  It&#x2019;s not that he flags shit content, that&#x2019;s actually an incredibly valuable service, but it&#x2019;s that he calls them cunts afterwards (in his defense he recently flagged one of my posts without calling me a cunt afterward so maybe he&#x2019;ll be in the top list of mine next time).</p>
<p>@transisto-  Another solid curator with a ton of power, but also didn&#x2019;t quite make my list because of his flagging.  In his case it sometimes seems random to me, but on the whole despite being prickly at times he&#x2019;s a great investor in the Steem platform.  He takes curation very seriously, and when he&#x2019;s doing good flag work he&#x2019;s actually doing a great service to the platform to return shitpost rewards back to the hard workers and quality content producers on the block.  I&#x2019;m not sure I can call him a friend, but I can share that he has my respect.  Thanks for what you do bud!</p>
