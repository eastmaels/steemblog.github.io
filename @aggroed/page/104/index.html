<p>Every year I go up to Vermont and host a multi day party.   My brother and I own a small cabin in the woods and we pack it full of people.  It&#x2019;s like a little ski shack, but we shove people in it like crazy.  There are 5 very small bedrooms in the house.  We&#x2019;ve had as many as 34 people stay the night.  It&#x2019;s packed!  I&#x2019;m actually thinking of hosting a giant Steem party this summer since I like hosting these.  I may end up renting a summer camp before/after camp is in session and let people from the platform come for a week and hang out like it was steem summer camp :)</p>
<p>We&#x2019;ve been hosting this party for over 25 years.  And I&#x2019;m blessed to have friends that have been coming for more than a decade some of them I&#x2019;ve known for 30 years.  Most of them I&#x2019;ve known for 20 years or more.  I have a very blessed life that I&#x2019;m grateful for on the daily.</p>
<p>Now, it takes some qualities to be handle a 15-30 person party in a house not really designed for more than 10 at a time.  I just want to pull a few of those things together and talk about some characteristics of my best friends for 30 years.</p>
<h2 id="Current-Former-outdoors-people"><a href="#Current-Former-outdoors-people" class="headerlink" title="Current/Former outdoors people "></a>Current/Former outdoors people </h2><h2></h2><p>Most of us met at outdoor summer camps.  I&#x2019;ve personally hiked over 400 miles on the Appalachian trail.  Some of these people have done most of those miles with me.  If you can handle the stress of carrying a 40-80lbs pack, filled with communal stuff, have to take turns at chores, pissing and shitting in the woods and outhouses, and living without electronics for a while then you&#x2019;re my kind of people.  These folks have inner strength, a lot of character, physical strength, and a tolerance for living in less than luxurious settings (which this party requires).</p>
<h2 id="Professional-Nerds"><a href="#Professional-Nerds" class="headerlink" title="Professional Nerds "></a>Professional Nerds </h2><h2></h2><p>Look at the room I see an architect, a computer programmer, an accountant, a pharma project manager, and me.  Often we have some lawyers, teachers, and doctors up here too.  We&#x2019;re nerds.  I roll with nerds.  Literally, I roll dice with nerds as we play pathfinder, splendor, catan, and a million other euro style games.  One of the foundations of this place is a willingness to hang out and play games and have that be a fun weekend.</p>
<h2 id="Work-Ethic"><a href="#Work-Ethic" class="headerlink" title="Work Ethic "></a>Work Ethic </h2><h2></h2><p>The house is heated by wood.  I had to go out this morning in sub zero temperatures to take wood from the primary stack, bring it inside, and stoke the fire.  I would have done it alone.  I didn&#x2019;t ask anyone to go, and within 5 minutes of being outside two other dudes were there to help me stack.  Stacking wood sucks.  It even sucks more when it&#x2019;s sub zero degrees, but that&#x2019;s who these people are.  They have a sense of pitching in.  Sure it makes us all warm, but they could have let me do it all, but my peeps don&#x2019;t mind contributing.</p>
<h2 id="Warmth"><a href="#Warmth" class="headerlink" title="Warmth "></a>Warmth </h2><h2></h2><p>I think after all the years I&#x2019;ve lived I&#x2019;ve finally settled on the most important feature of a person that I look for is warmth.  You&#x2019;re allowed good days and bad days.  You&#x2019;re allowed to be happy or sad.  The best measurement of your baseline is your level of warmth.  Not temperature so much as genuine kindness and caring towards other people.  Looks will fade.  Brains will slow.  But your heart will keep being kind towards others if that&#x2019;s what you cultivated.  My friends will pickup the phone to check in if you&#x2019;re sick.  They&#x2019;ll root for you when there is success they themselves aren&#x2019;t currently experiencing.  They look out for one another.</p>
<h2 id="I&#x2019;m-blessed"><a href="#I&#x2019;m-blessed" class="headerlink" title="I&#x2019;m blessed "></a>I&#x2019;m blessed </h2><h2></h2><p>Most of the world doesn&#x2019;t have it as good as my family does.  That&#x2019;s part of why I think it&#x2019;s so important that I spend my time fighting for change.  I&#x2019;m looking to spread Peace, Abundance, and Liberty throughout the world.  I&#x2019;m blessed by a lovely wife, amazing kids, and fantastic friends.  Hopefully your friends support you, love you, and care for you and it&#x2019;s reciprocal.</p>

<h1 id="Passive-Aggressive-and-Assertive-Communication"><a href="#Passive-Aggressive-and-Assertive-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Passive, Aggressive, and Assertive Communication"></a>Passive, Aggressive, and Assertive Communication</h1><p>When it comes to communication, balance is key.<br>We can view the communication styles of passive, aggressive, and assertive, as a spectrum with passive and aggressive being the extremes and assertive being the healthy balance in between.</p>
<center> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6DMY1MD.png" alt=""> </center>


<h3 id="Passive-Communication"><a href="#Passive-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Passive Communication"></a>Passive Communication</h3><p>This involves prioritizing other&#x2019;s feelings, wants, and needs over your own.<br>People who passively communicate will not express their needs or stand up for themselves.<br>They are usually soft spoken, lack confidence, have weak boundaries, avoid all conflict, and may even have a victim mentality.</p>
<h3 id="Aggressive-Communication"><a href="#Aggressive-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Aggressive Communication"></a>Aggressive Communication</h3><p>Those who aggressively communicate cross over their own boundaries into another person&#x2019;s boundaries.<br>They aggressively communicate their feelings, wants, and needs at the expense of others by ignoring other&#x2019;s needs and/or bullying.<br>Aggressive communicators are usually loud, disrespectful, easily frustrated, unwilling to compromise, inconsiderate of others, explosive, manipulative, critical, and sometimes even threatening and hostile.</p>
<h3 id="Assertive-Communication"><a href="#Assertive-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Assertive Communication"></a>Assertive Communication</h3><p>The key here is balance as both party&#x2019;s feelings, wants, and needs are adressed.<br>Assertive communication means that you can communicate your feelings, wants, and needs in a clear and calm way while also listening to and respecting the needs of others.<br>Assertive communicators are confident and exhibit healthy boundaries and an ability to compromise.  </p>

<p>Aggroed:  Next year there will be flowers.<br>Skeptic: How can you say that?  The world is messed up!  Prices are lagging!!  Other currencies exist and they are our competitors!  Challenges ARE EVERYWHERE!?!!?!?!?!<br>Aggroed: Because we&#x2019;re planting them.</p>
<h2 id="SBDs"><a href="#SBDs" class="headerlink" title="SBDs "></a>SBDs </h2><h2></h2><p>Steem has been doing well and growing.  It&#x2019;s not quite as fast or as sexy in it&#x2019;s growth as some of the other coins just yet, but it&#x2019;s growing and moving.  Then the Koreans put Steem and SBD on one of their smaller exchanges.  Then they started pumping SBD.  I think the logic goes something like there&#x2019;s only 3.6M of them.  They don&#x2019;t grow that quickly.  They are free to use and useful because transactions confirm in 3 seconds, and ultimately they look pretty cheap.  They started stocking up!  We had up to $15 SBDs.  BTC tanked a little and we&#x2019;re back down to $7-8 SBDS, but either way when you get your post rewards it&#x2019;s a ton of money.</p>
<p>A post pays out roughly 0.4 of the value of what&#x2019;s shown on Steemit.com in SBDS.  Then you multiply that by $8.  So, a hundred dollar post on steemit will pay 40 SBDS and you multiply that by 8 and your post is worth $320!!!  That&#x2019;s a ton of money for something that you likely spent 1 hour writing (there&#x2019;s usually a project or expertise behind that too).  It&#x2019;s a great return!  It helped push our activity way up!!!  We just broke the record of active number of users at 44k and it&#x2019;s going up even more.  Thanks @penguinpablo for keeping great stats on this!</p>

<h2 id="Alexa-690-USA"><a href="#Alexa-690-USA" class="headerlink" title="Alexa: 690 USA "></a>Alexa: 690 USA </h2><h2></h2><p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmXKhyPUFKxkhFRBxGsF5LjBcD8kAR8LTYq1ay5Usk6Nhv/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Alexa is a ranking system of activity of internet pages.  As you can see we&#x2019;re now in the top 700 most active websites in America and in the top 2000 of the entire world.  Personally I think this is tied to high SBDs, and hope they stay high and continue to get higher (especially as the price of btc rises).  </p>
<p>This platform is a little over a year and half.  The number of businesses that are in the top 2000 that are that young I&#x2019;m guessing is pretty few.  Most of those have been established for 10 years or more.  The fact that we&#x2019;re there is evidence we&#x2019;re doing great.  Lots of haters out there think its not enough, or Steem&#x2019;s a piece of shit cause it isn&#x2019;t in the top five yet, but I don&#x2019;t think those people have reasonable expectations.  When I started Steem was at $20 cents and 50k accounts overall.  It&#x2019;s a year later and we&#x2019;re 15x more valuable, we&#x2019;re in the top 700 websites, and we grew the number of accounts by about 10x while asking people to pay between $2 and $20 bucks to start an account here.</p>
<p>Steem&#x2019;s doing great.  Try to be reasonable!</p>
<h2 id="Velocity-and-Youtube-Adpocolypse"><a href="#Velocity-and-Youtube-Adpocolypse" class="headerlink" title="Velocity and Youtube Adpocolypse "></a>Velocity and Youtube Adpocolypse </h2><h2></h2><p>So, Steem tracks the number of software updates as &#x201C;hardforks.&#x201D;  We&#x2019;re on hardfork 19.  We&#x2019;re working on hardfork 20, and it should happen soon.  I&#x2019;m guessing in January.  What it does is give the Steem community a fast way to make new accounts that doesn&#x2019;t require 6 steem.  It&#x2019;s changing it so that new accounts are minable and they will have limited ability to act on the blockchain without 6 steem.  That means we can start having lots of people join this community and it shouldn&#x2019;t take days or weeks to get new people into the system.</p>
<p>Combine that with the YouTube adpocolypse and I start seeing dollar signs.  YouTube is now blocking payments to certain YouTube channel operators.  You can argue the reason why they are doing it (censorship vs corporate sponsers), but the effect is the same.  People that used to count on money from YouTube aren&#x2019;t getting it anymore and they are looking for a place to earn money with their content.  I believe this a great home for them because they can post novel content here and get rewarded for it, and then archive it on youtube 7 days later and get longer term revenue from that too (assuming they haven&#x2019;t been dropped).  </p>
<p>One thing that&#x2019;s stopping some folks from doing this is just how hard it is for the sign up process to work, and that&#x2019;s frustrating for their audience they are trying to bring over.  The pitch of come here and let&#x2019;s grow together doesn&#x2019;t work well if they have a hard time getting here!</p>
<h2 id="Communities"><a href="#Communities" class="headerlink" title="Communities "></a>Communities </h2><h2></h2><p>Steemit is working on another big change to build communal accounts into <code>condenser.</code>Condenser is the program that powers steemit.com to interact with the Steem blockchain.  The Minnow Support Project has been doing this successfully for a while now, but we&#x2019;ve had to build tools from scratch off the block and off of condenser to allow it.  But we&#x2019;ve already seen how a community account can help a social group blow up to 6,500 members in just a few short months.  We started from scratch with no followers or money.  Imagine when established groups have the ability to do this.  It&#x2019;s going to bring whole networks, non-profits, schools, etc onto the platform.</p>
<h2 id="SMTs"><a href="#SMTs" class="headerlink" title="SMTs "></a>SMTs </h2><h2></h2><p>Smart Media Tokens is basically going to turn Steem from a blogging platform with a crypto currency into the program that will tokenize the internet.  Want your buisness to launch a token then click a few buttons.  Want your non-profit to launch a token then click a few buttons.  Steem is fast, reliable, scalable, and has an incredible starting point for growth.  When we make it easy for every group on the planet to aggregate capital and use it as they see fit it&#x2019;s going to make this place explode.  Everyone and their mother is going to have a token on Steem and unlike Ethereum that clogged because of a few cryptokitties we have the ability to scale a few hundred larger than where we&#x2019;re at now without any of the tweaks Steemit is working on now.</p>
<h2 id="We&#x2019;re-going-places-and-2018-is-gonna-be-epic"><a href="#We&#x2019;re-going-places-and-2018-is-gonna-be-epic" class="headerlink" title="We&#x2019;re going places and 2018 is gonna be epic! "></a>We&#x2019;re going places and 2018 is gonna be epic! </h2><h2></h2><p>This platform is going to explode next year.  Just hang onto your hats.  Make sure you&#x2019;re posting daily and getting as much Steem as you can before it rockets up and enjoy the high SBDs with your payouts.  Finally, what&#x2019;s going to make sure this place grows?  YOU!  YES YOU!  </p>
<p>You&#x2019;re going to tell your friend about Steem and help them sign up.<br>You&#x2019;re going to tell businesses about Steem and get them to accept it<br>You&#x2019;re going to make friend and communities that help people stick with the platform.<br>You&#x2019;re going to use rewards wisely to help promote great people and great content.<br>You&#x2019;re going to create great programs that make new tools and features on the block.</p>
<p>Collectively we&#x2019;re gonna Moon and I&#x2019;m looking for a massive growth year in 2018.  Don&#x2019;t let this opportunity pass you by!</p>

<p>We have a ton of new people on the site.  I interact with a lot of them.  I founded and help manage the Minnow Support Project, which is the Steemit official welcome group.  We have about 6,500 active members and they ask a lot of questions and have a lot of misconceptions.  So, let&#x2019;s start with the basics.</p>
<h2 id="Begging-for-votes-resteems-and-&#x201C;will-you-please-review-my-post&#x201D;-will-help-you-grow"><a href="#Begging-for-votes-resteems-and-&#x201C;will-you-please-review-my-post&#x201D;-will-help-you-grow" class="headerlink" title="Begging for votes, resteems, and &#x201C;will you please review my post&#x201D; will help you grow."></a>Begging for votes, resteems, and &#x201C;will you please review my post&#x201D; will help you grow.</h2><p>What you really need to grow your account on Steem is a community that stands behind you.  Nothing erodes confidence that you&#x2019;re a good man/woman/furry to get involved with like begging for upvotes, resteems, or post reviews.  Most of the folk that I know on the platform want to see good people succeed, and begging is a great indicator that you&#x2019;re a selfish person not worth the effort.  Start by helping others and offering services as that&#x2019;s much better way to make friends than simply asking others for their charity.</p>
<h2 id="I-need-to-author-more"><a href="#I-need-to-author-more" class="headerlink" title="I need to author more"></a>I need to author more</h2><p>When you&#x2019;re just starting authoring isn&#x2019;t gonna be a big help for on you.  You don&#x2019;t have a network, people don&#x2019;t know you, and unless you have a following from some other social media platform you&#x2019;re not bringing a lot to the table.  Good writing/art/creations/projects is really just the beginning of what you need on the platform.  It&#x2019;s like the minimum requirement for success.  What you really need is to grow an audience and that takes time.  You need followers who support you and help you grow.  One of the best ways to do that on the Steem block chain is to comment a ton on other people&#x2019;s posts.</p>
<p>Try to set a goal of 20-30 comments a day when you&#x2019;re starting.  Your wallet and follower count will thank you and you&#x2019;ll actually be ready to start posting in no time!</p>
<h2 id="Flagging-is-evil"><a href="#Flagging-is-evil" class="headerlink" title="Flagging is evil"></a>Flagging is evil</h2><p>Nothing is gonna set a minnow off like flags.  Just about anyone who catches a flag wants to go full melt down and burn everything to the ground.  Flags can be healthy.  Flags return rewards from individuals to the reward pool and that ultimately helps the entire community.  It just sucks when it&#x2019;s you getting the flag.  The rules of this place let you place upvotes and downvotes.  It&#x2019;s your stake.  If they think your content is overrated or shit or whatever it&#x2019;s their choice to take yours down a notch.  </p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re getting 20 views on a $100 post expect some flags.  You can melt down&#x2026; or you can work on behalf of the platform to try to get your views up by posting your content on other social media platforms.  Sometimes you gotta work for it.</p>
<p>If you happen to catch a flag try not to melt down.  It might be the biggest thing that happens to you and can help you grow, but not if you&#x2019;re writing your rage quit letter.  Take a breath and try to see where the other people are coming from.</p>
<h2 id="It&#x2019;s-impossible-to-get-ahead"><a href="#It&#x2019;s-impossible-to-get-ahead" class="headerlink" title="It&#x2019;s impossible to get ahead"></a>It&#x2019;s impossible to get ahead</h2><p>What new buisness do you know that starts and immediately earns $1M per year and starts handing you Lambos?  It doesn&#x2019;t exist.  Steem isn&#x2019;t any different.  Crypto is better than just about any other place on the planet right now, but it isn&#x2019;t instant.  This place isn&#x2019;t a scam, but it isn&#x2019;t a money press built just for you either.  it takes time.  It takes a community.  It takes effort.  The people that make it work through the slow times because they love it anyway will reap rewards after they have become an overnight success over a year in the making.</p>
<h2 id="I-only-have-to-interact-on-Steem"><a href="#I-only-have-to-interact-on-Steem" class="headerlink" title="I only have to interact on Steem"></a>I only have to interact on Steem</h2><p>Last time for the people in the back.  The most important thing you need is a community around you that helps and supports you.  It&#x2019;s hard to build that just on Steem.  Steem doesn&#x2019;t have any instant messaging.  It&#x2019;s basically like having Pen Pals, and it&#x2019;s hard to make life long friendships with penpals.  So, here&#x2019;s my suggestion.  Join PALnet, join SteemSpeak, join whaleshares, and join as many of the Telegram, Discord, and Slack groups that you can and be active in them.  That&#x2019;s how you make friends and that&#x2019;s how you&#x2019;ll start making progress on the site.</p>

<p>So, I just had a lovely evening this evening with friends that I&#x2019;ve known for a few years as part of muh wife&#x2019;s moms group.  They are lovely people.  Our kids play together.  Their kids are funny, smart, and friendly.  The adults are kind, hard working, thoughtful and funny.  I just don&#x2019;t know what to say to them anymore.</p>
<p>I can say the seasonal things.  I can ask for carrots and peas politely.  I can ask how they are feeling, but it&#x2019;s hard to engage these days in conversation.  All I want to do is sit around and tell them about crypto.  I mean.  I did that, but it&#x2019;s not nice to overwhelm people with this for hours.  It&#x2019;s probably in their best long term interest&#x2026; but that doesn&#x2019;t mean that they want to hear it at the seasonal party.</p>

<p>Literally just about everything I&#x2019;m doing is either hanging with my family or poured back into Steem.  I like it because it&#x2019;s financially rewarding and simultaneously it brings me life satisfaction to work on providing an alternative to the status quo that basically sucks for everyone on the planet right now.</p>
<hr>
<p>&#x201C;Did you know that the Federal Reserve is a private bank, and that private bank doesn&#x2019;t act like it&#x2019;s under the jurisdiction of the government?  Please pass the peas.  Did you know that the government you think is a government is actually a corporation that&#x2019;s claiming to represent the original de jure government?  Also, that government doesn&#x2019;t really have any rights over you either because all of these relationships involve voluntary contracts that you never voluntarily signed under full disclosure?  Pass the butter?&#x201D;</p>

<p>I can&#x2019;t act normally with normal people anymore.  I&#x2019;m trying to balance talking about what I care about and current social norms.  I don&#x2019;t worry about these things on the daily, but when I&#x2019;m representing my family in normal society I&#x2019;m a little at a loss.  I don&#x2019;t want to hurt relationships with my kids friends by being THAT GUY at the dinner table.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s not to say that I don&#x2019;t promote these things in public with the fiat normies too!  But I am trying to balance it being the only thing that I care about and try to have a range of discussion that feels inclusive to others at the table.</p>
<p>&#x201C;So, how bout them Pats distracting you from the Fed crushing the economy?&#x201D;  I think I still need some work.</p>
