            <p>Ok, timing the bottom is hard.  This might be it, it might not be.  This could go on for a year.  We could be back up in a week.  The fact remains that this is some cheap ass steem.  So, two things about that.  Some whales are dumping.  That&#x2019;s great.  We can make a better distribution on the platform and get a middle class going.  It&#x2019;s also a great chance for you to have and grow an account here.  So, take the dive, buy some Steem, and I bet a year from now you&#x2019;ll be thrilled you did.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s impossible to know your exact financial situation.  So, don&#x2019;t spend money you can&#x2019;t afford to lose.  I&#x2019;m not a guy who can give you financial advice.  I don&#x2019;t know your financial situation. I can just share that I&#x2019;m happy to pick up more steem when the price is low and looking forward to selling it when the price is high.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s blood in the streets and capitulation appears to be ongoing.  Consider a ladder buy in and join the ranks of the dolphin class.</p>

<p>I saw this on a Tone Vays video.  I saw it again on @samstonehill&#x2019;s wall.  I know.  Life sucks at the moment.  it&#x2019;s doom and gloom, but that trend line has been around for a while now.  it puts btc at 70k by 2021.  That&#x2019;s if it&#x2019;s again at the bottom of the trend line.  It&#x2019;ll be higher.</p>
<p>So, just calm yo&#x2019; tits.  Buy the dip.  Gift yourself and your buddies steem and steem monsters for xmas this year!</p>
<p>Could it go down more?  yes!  Is bitcoin doomed forever?  No!</p>
<p>This seems like a great time to enter the market.  Oh, and incidently this is part of how btc keeps growing.  These boom and bust cycles allow new entry points for users, which make more people try to hold bitcoin, which makes the value of any individual coin rise over time.  it blows for btc right now and certainly hurts the alt coins, but muh dudez, the next ATH goes even higher because of the current dip.</p>
<p>Write some posts.  Build a buisness.   If you can find some work that pays in crypto now&#x2019;s the time to get it!!!  Accept it at the lows.  Cash out at the highs.  Stick a &#x201C;for hire&#x201D; sign on your wall.  Get some writing, translating, art, music, coding done, hodl for a bit, and realize that by doing that you can 10x or more your wages by the next ATH.</p>
<p>*Not financial advice.  Do your own due diligence.  It&#x2019;s on you if you sell your house to buy Steem Monsters cards.  I don&#x2019;t know your circumstances so it&#x2019;s impossible to tell you if selling everything you own and purchasing a lot of gold foil legendaries is right for you.  This post is for cheerleading, entertainment, promotion, and idea planting.</p>

<p>So, it sucks out there.  Crypto is down.  Steem is down.  Chicken little just knocked on my door and kicked me in my balls.  This happens here.  Crypto prices are either seriously manipulated, the pendulum of a free market can sway wildly and/or both.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;ve been able to earn some fiat over the last little while I&#x2019;d encourage you to think of this as a fantastic sale.  I&#x2019;d like to say it&#x2019;s the sale of a lifetime, but honestly, I think we&#x2019;ll see ball breaking crypto prices again just over the next ATH.  That&#x2019;s how it works.  2 massive steps forward.  One massive step back.  This is like the 8th cycle of this for crypto.  Maybe this one is different, but probably not.  If you have some cash handy this will likely make you rich later.  If you don&#x2019;t it&#x2019;s likely going to cause a deep upset and likely panic.  Keep that in mind when we reach the next ATH so you remember to cash some or a lot out!</p>
<p>The Crypto cycle seems to go back and forth between outlandish bullish eupohoria on the way up and then ball busting, life-destrying suicide inducing stress on the way down.  Welcome to Crypto.</p>
<h2 id="Food-for-thought"><a href="#Food-for-thought" class="headerlink" title="Food for thought"></a>Food for thought</h2><p>One thing I like to keep in mind as I watch my net worth drop is a few things.  1.  I came here primarily to have a voice and later to build a home and a spread a mission.  Any of the money that I&#x2019;ve made here is gravy.  The voice, home, and mission carry on.  We&#x2019;re just reloading.  Look around.  The people still here are the ones to watch this coming year.  They&#x2019;re the people supporting this place and keeping the lights on while the normies get roped into crypto 1 by 1.</p>
<p>While it&#x2019;s hard to consider it now a year from now when we&#x2019;re back at all time highs you won&#x2019;t care if the price hit 100, 1000, 3000, or 4000.  Did you care that we started this last rally from like $120?  No&#x2026; well you won&#x2019;t care a year from now either.  It&#x2019;s gonna go down.  It may go down more.  Crypto isn&#x2019;t dead.  You can&#x2019;t kill it. 10 years from now through all these boom and bust cycles anything that can be on a blockchain will be.  that&#x2019;s the future.  Just gotta keep some healthy perspective now before you panic sell all your shit at the low and panic buy it all back at the highs!</p>
<ol>
<li>When does the bull market start?  When the bear market is over.  The recent capitulation is part of the cycle.  Pretty soon you&#x2019;ll be calling anyone that buys into the next rally an idiot after you sold all your crypto&#x2026; then you&#x2019;re wondering why it keeps going up, and then you&#x2019;re trying to cram all your life savings in right before it busts again.  This is the cycle.  There&#x2019;s lots of memes and images about it. </li>
</ol>

<p>read this about the psychology of <a href="http://financeandcareer.com/the-4-psychological-phases-of-asset-bubbles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asset bubbles</a></p>
<p>Try not to panic and lose all your shit.  Make informed decisions.  If you didnt&#x2019; think you could wait this out you should have sold before it had a chance to capitulate.  If you didn&#x2019;t know then don&#x2019;t panic.  Look at how these markets tend to function.</p>
<p>The track that btc is on even while we touch this low end of the support would put us at 70k btc by 2021.  It&#x2019;s a shitty feeling now, but won&#x2019;t be forever.  My main suggestion is <strong>DON&#x2019;T PANIC!</strong> Make informed and conscious decisions.  Don&#x2019;t just freak the fuck out.  Consider what you need to survive and pay your bills</p>
<ol>
<li>Steem isn&#x2019;t dead.  We still have 50k active community members all over the world.  They&#x2019;re pretty sticky to this place.  We&#x2019;ve lost some weak hands and fools that only wanted money.  The people that get that this is a life changing thing are still here.  When this is over we&#x2019;ll have a host of new business and apps popping up, we have SMTs on the way that will let new businesses pool money and tap into our ecosystem.  We have more rebuilding and some shit in front of us.  But I&#x2019;d urge you to stick tight.  If you have some fiat around or get some for Christmas consider giving yourself the gift of Steem.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Steem Monsters is a good fucking investment.  So, I have watched basically all of my crypto assets get slammed, but one that&#x2019;s holding up extremely well is Steem Monsters cards.  I&#x2019;m grateful to the hardcore community that knows just how awesome this game is and will be.  We&#x2019;ll be implementing some changes after Thanksgiving that are simple and make it 10x more fun than it already is.  Tournaments are around the corner and we&#x2019;ll start giving out money on the daily and putting out some marketing for the game.  As you&#x2019;re thinking about how to get back into the market, or how to HODL through it I&#x2019;d strongly recommend getting monsters.  You can thank me later.</li>

<p>Anyway, it&#x2019;s hard to keep your head about you when everyone else is losing theirs.  Make calm decisions.  This too shall pass and if you play your cards right there&#x2019;s some great shit on the other side for you!</p>
<p>Disclaimer:  I don&#x2019;t make financial decisions for you.  You are responsible.  This isn&#x2019;t financial advice as I don&#x2019;t know you or your financial situation.  I can&#x2019;t tell if selling all of your belongings to purchase Steem Monsters cards is right for you.  You have to do your own due diligence.  This is for entertainment and my own edification and hopefully it&#x2019;s food for thought to consider along with all the other sentiments that are out there.</p>

<p>Hopefully you&#x2019;re leaving Steemfest and feeling just as pumped about the future of Steem as I am.  Hundreds of people from all over the world are passionate Steemians that seem excited by the possibilities that are opening up in front of them.  Not only does the Steem blockchain support a decentralized blogging platform that can distribute rewards for posting, but it also has the ability to host successful businesses.</p>
<p>I had a blast talking to content creators and developers this past week, but one of the groups I felt was missing was business people.  Steem needs some savvy minds to work together to form teams of people to tackle problems out in the world.  That&#x2019;s going to have to include business minded folks.  Maybe you have what it takes to level up from dreamer to executor.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s a lot of starry eyed devs I met that want free things to take over the world, but if I have a central takeaway from this post it would be: <strong>it&#x2019;s ok to charge money for a good product or service!</strong>  Honestly, if you want your business to change the world it can&#x2019;t simply rely on a little bit of curation rewards or even a moderate amount of rewards with a Steemit delegation.  You have to actually sell something that people want.  You have to collect more money than you spend.  You have to make an actual business.</p>
<p>If you want to change the world it&#x2019;s going to take some funds.  Curation isn&#x2019;t going to scale well enough to help you significantly.  You&#x2019;re going to have to earn it like everyone else in the world.  Steem makes a lot of that easy, but there&#x2019;s some stuff you gotta do.  </p>
<h2 id="Turn-Key"><a href="#Turn-Key" class="headerlink" title="Turn Key"></a>Turn Key</h2><p>Steem is a turn key blockchain.  You have a functioning blockchain that can store your data that other people pay for.  You have a functioning community of 50,000 active steemians every day that come here and enter our marketplace.  You have a fluctuating currency and a fairly stable currency.  You need an idea, a plan, a team, and some execution and you can make it happen.</p>
<h2 id="Competition"><a href="#Competition" class="headerlink" title="Competition"></a>Competition</h2><p>I&#x2019;m incentivizing writing up some business plans with a 100 steem business plan competition.  **Edit: @jackmiller is kicking in another 50 steem for the prize) . The prize is small but with it will come some good exposure, allies, devs, more money and some good exposure for what you want to do.</p>
<p>To compete you owe me a post with 5 sections in it.  This has to be related to a business you would want to make on the Steem Blockchain.</p>
<ol>
<li>Problem: Describe to me the problem that you see out there.  What challenge has been especially frustrating that you want to solve.</li>
<li>Vision:  Put together a vision of what the solution to the problem would look like</li>
<li>Mission:  Briefly describe how you&#x2019;ll go about doing business with the world.  In this is a little bit of value, ethos, and some idea of what&#x2019;s at the heart of making your business successful.</li>
<li>Plan:  Tell me a handful of concrete steps that you can do in the next 3 months to start executing on vision.  </li>
<li>Budget and team:  Try to work through some numbers to figure out what is the bare minimum amount of money to try to put in place the tiniest inkling of a business that can actually generate revenue.  If you have team members in mind list them.  If you know a position/role, but not the person to fill it just mention the role and give a brief description.  If it requires some infrastructure try to scope it out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall this should be a 1-2 page document.  If it&#x2019;s more than that you&#x2019;re doing it wrong.  Keep it concise.</p>
<p>Submissions should be made as a post and linked in the comments below.  Submissions are due by post payout.<br>It&#x2019;s my contest and I&#x2019;ll judge it personally.  I may bring in some other folks to review and if your business plan seems cool I may even try to network some on your behalf to make it a reality.</p>
<h2 id="Key-takeaway"><a href="#Key-takeaway" class="headerlink" title="Key takeaway"></a>Key takeaway</h2><p>If your business loses money it&#x2019;s just an expensive hobby.  If it makes money it&#x2019;s a profitable entity with a chance to make some changes around us.  Make sure that as you design this thing you show how it&#x2019;s going to make money.</p>
<p>Good luck.  Let&#x2019;s get another Steem Monsters on the block!</p>

<p>So, I think I&#x2019;m likely the person that scours this data more than just about anyone.  I can think of 1-2 others that might be as maniacal about is as me&#x2026; but regardless I watch it pretty closely.  I have a few numbers that I personally care about more than any others as I&#x2019;m evaluating the overall financial success of the project for people staking cards.</p>
<p>The first number I watch is the marketcap.  We have 79 cards in the game that are available as alpha, beta, or promotional editions.  If you total up the last card price that the card sold at, multiply by the number of those types of cards in existence, lastly sum them all together, and you get what we&#x2019;re calling the Monster Market Cap.  You don&#x2019;t have to do any math.  The bot that @danielsaori made for Steem Monsters does this for you.  Simply go into the sm-voters_hut room and type $marketcap.  Right now it&#x2019;s $1.3M.  Two days ago was $1.24M.  That&#x2019;s a 5% gain in 2 days.  If this pace remains by this time next year we&#x2019;ll have a $10M marketcap.</p>
<p>To put our current position in perspective I like to visit coinmarketcap.  As you can see if we were a standard coin we would be in position 845 right now.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmSrqaoZjQL8N6FqMFDFV7U6A4uqsvcUbFVUfE4W3xD6Ht/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This would put us in the top 40% of all coins that exist.  We have a ways to go for sure, but that&#x2019;s not bad considering we&#x2019;ve been here since May.</p>
<h2 id="People-are-the-Value"><a href="#People-are-the-Value" class="headerlink" title="People are the Value"></a>People are the Value</h2><p>The number 1 thing in my eyes to watch is the number of people playing the game.  @holger80 has a number of charts on beempy.com/steemmonsters that track useful information about the game.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZw2KNFSPG8S8xa1KAtTKjbv5VEh7qZtuQmAn1iY3zCSW/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see we just crossed the 2000 player mark.  That&#x2019;s a different number than the number of people with accounts.  We have just under 3k accounts now who have purchased the starter pack, but only 2000 of them are playing, which means the other 1000 either don&#x2019;t take it seriously at all, or really only view this as an investment rather than a playable thing.</p>
<p>Matt had some ethereum game devs bragging to him about how many people were playing their game.  They were near the most played game.  They had 12 people.  By grand theft auto standards Steem Monsters is still nothing.  Not even a spec.  By crypto it&#x2019;s the biggest game going by number of daily players as far as I know.</p>
<h2 id="Actual-value-of-muh-cards"><a href="#Actual-value-of-muh-cards" class="headerlink" title="Actual value of muh cards"></a>Actual value of muh cards</h2><p>Lastly I like to track how much my personal holdings are worth</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmc9sPp7TzLwkNi3xjLmTXMbpyxF8tAjRfUJg73g7jHRND/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>No, I haven&#x2019;t spent $70k buying cards, but I have seen my investment steadily going up.  I see new players, a higher marketcap, passionate fans, tournaments haven&#x2019;t been put in place, we crossed 350k games played, and marketing efforts haven&#x2019;t kicked into gear yet and won&#x2019;t until tournaments are here.  I think this game has a ton of potential and even just where we are at it&#x2019;s already showing a good time and great great returns.  This is why I have $74k in the cards already and plan on buying more.</p>
<p>Card delegation will be a thing.  I see investors renting cards to players who are going after tournament rewards and the investors will get steady passive rewards from doing it.  It&#x2019;s gonna be a beautiful thing for HODLers.</p>
<p>Anyway, this isn&#x2019;t financial advice, do your own due diligence, it&#x2019;s for entertainment and information purposes only, I don&#x2019;t know you or your finanicial situation well enough to give the advice that you should SODL HOUSE AND HOLD MONSTERS, and even if I did give that advice you&#x2019;d have to vet it through your own process and be responsible for your own decisions.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m happy with the returns I&#x2019;m getting.  I think they are some of the best in crypto.  If I give any advice it&#x2019;s that this game, community, and opportunity are worth investigating.</p>
