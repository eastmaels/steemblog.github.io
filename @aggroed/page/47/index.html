<p>Hey folks.  Normally I would do these as two separate posts, but I&#x2019;m so slammed and tired it&#x2019;s hard to imagine cranking both of them out right meow.  I haven&#x2019;t been this exhausted since my last year of grad school while writing my dissertation.  I thought I was busy before Steem Monsters launched.  That pace would feel like a vacation.  It&#x2019;s a wonderful problem to have and one I&#x2019;m grateful for.  I mean&#x2026; we&#x2019;ve sold about $50k worth of Monsters in the first 10 days.  That&#x2019;s pretty incredible.   You being stoked makes us more stoked.</p>
<h2 id="Peace-Academy"><a href="#Peace-Academy" class="headerlink" title="Peace Academy "></a>Peace Academy </h2><h2></h2><p>The first video is the peace academy.  We have a discussion here about how we&#x2019;re going to put the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty and weave them into the game.  We have a bit of an esoteric adventure figuring out how that might happen and what it&#x2019;s going to look like.  Good times!</p>

<h2 id="Minnow-Mayor-Town-Hall"><a href="#Minnow-Mayor-Town-Hall" class="headerlink" title="Minnow Mayor Town Hall"></a>Minnow Mayor Town Hall</h2><p>This is 3.5 hours of discussion around steem monsters.  We continue the story crafting of Steem Monsters in the first part of the show, and later @yabapmatt comes on and we discuss how to setup some standard rules for how the stats will operate.  If you&#x2019;re looking for more detail on rule mechanics we&#x2019;re passionately discussing them in the second half of the show.</p>

        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p></p><center> <img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYc2VpwcViuqS2duXUEPBWZS7mZ5PZMKw1seXDgcXjT3o/image.png" alt=""><br></center><br>I&#x2019;m the founder of the Minnow Support Project which has a home in a Discord group called the <a href="minnowpond.org">Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network</a>.  It has a very simple mission statement:  To spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, to grow the Steem ecosystem and to train and retain Minnows on the platform.  This is a public community with no commercial enterprise and focuses on giving away money and resteems in the weekly contest, votes and resteems for community curation, and free votes for any non-banned Steemian on the platform that wants a few pennies to help them get started.<p></p>
<p>Steem Monsters is different for sure.  It&#x2019;s a business that sells a game.  It may or may not surprise you, but the true mission of Steem Monsters is very much rooted in the same sentiment and mission statement of PAL/MSP.  Besides making money in a commercial venture what are the goals of Steem Monsters?</p>
<h2 id="Value-Overlap"><a href="#Value-Overlap" class="headerlink" title="Value Overlap"></a>Value Overlap</h2><p>We&#x2019;re going to spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty through creative story telling and provide good and bad examples of how communities can be.  We&#x2019;ll poke fun at systems that don&#x2019;t support these values or have them bring ruin in the story telling of the game.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;re going to use this platform to bring new people onto the platform and grow the Steem ecosystem.  I don&#x2019;t mean to scoop myself&#x2026; but we&#x2019;re hiring a Director of Social Media today.  He&#x2019;s going to run contests outside of Steem to steal cryptokitty fans to our platform, get people from bitcoin and eos to get interested in Steem, and maybe spend a little time trying to capture fiat normies and get them into crypto too.  We&#x2019;re going to bring new users and we&#x2019;re going to try to be the best app on the blockchain at bringing new users here.</p>
<p>Training and retaining new members:  I&#x2019;m not sure training is going to fit into this, but we&#x2019;re building the game with the idea that retention kinda sucks right now and we need to improve it.  Not everyone can earn post rewards every day, but we can make it through daily quests that everyone on the chain has a chance to earn more monsters and level them up and then sell them to one another.  Here&#x2019;s another way to earn even if you&#x2019;re not simply posting.  Some may prefer that frankly.</p>
<h2 id="This-was-preemptive-question-answering"><a href="#This-was-preemptive-question-answering" class="headerlink" title="This was preemptive question answering"></a>This was preemptive question answering</h2><p>So, honestly not too many people have challenged me wondering what the goal of both of these groups are, but to me the mission is highly synergistic.  Should be overwhelming and tons of fun to steer the biggest online community on Steemit and the fastest growing application out there.</p>
<p>Good Times!</p>
<h2 id="Shilling"><a href="#Shilling" class="headerlink" title="Shilling"></a>Shilling</h2><p>If you want to see Steem Monsters grow we need more time from Yabapmatt and that should be easier to make happen if homeboy is a top 20 witness.  I&#x2019;m asking that you go vote for him and help us get him a steady income to free up his time to work on Monsters and other block chain developments.</p>

            <p>Well, no one should be shocked&#x2026; but Steem Monsters is taking over my life right now.  So, I have to respond in kind and double up my time.  I&#x2019;m hosting muh show.  My show will also feature talk abotu Steem Monsters.  I dont&#x2019; think I&#x2019;m always going to do this&#x2026; but for now it has to happen.</p>

<p>I have to build a setting for the game.  I need some cities.  Cultures.  Religions.  Currencies.  Attitudes. and just flavor so that authors who work on the cards </p>
<p>I also need a style guide.  I spent a lot of time in college in playwriting and screenwriting courses.  I also did a lot of performance art.  There&#x2019;s a standard mono-myth out there.  We have to follow that format for the monsters.  We have to figure out ways to make that mono-myth work for us.</p>

<p>I want a different playstyle for the various card colors.  Then I want to start working on specs for them.</p>
<p>So, what I&#x2019;m going to do is ask people to come talk to me about various card styles and how each different set of cards could work.  </p>
<p>High level I&#x2019;m thinking white focuses on defense and protection.<br>Black is a zerg.<br>Green is a heal deck<br>Red is DPS<br>blue is ?<br>Dragons do ?</p>
<h2 id="Game-basics"><a href="#Game-basics" class="headerlink" title="Game basics"></a>Game basics</h2><p>Attack- how much damage a monster can do<br>Magic attack- damage a monster will do automatically<br>Defense- amoutn of damage absorbed<br>health- amount of damage that can be taken before defeat<br>speed- who goes first likelihood to hit</p>

<p>We&#x2019;re going to work through how some of the stats can be play balanced, and put along side of mana costs.  If you&#x2019;re looking for a leg up on understanding how the game will work you won&#x2019;t want ot miss this.</p>

<p>Aggroedius the Lightbringer claps your hand.  &#x201C;I trust you know what you&#x2019;re doing.  Killing (insert your name here, destroyer of worlds) won&#x2019;t be easy.  She can infect your mind with nightmares.  She&#x2019;ll claw at your flesh.  And beware her offspring.  They&#x2019;re small, but their venom can turn your veins dark as night.&#x201D;  Something about how he said it makes your skin crawl for just a second.</p>
<p>Another man would balk at this task, but you&#x2019;ve trained for this.  You&#x2019;re ready for this.  And you&#x2019;re not alone.  You look over your shoulder and see 10 of the finest warriors in the realm ready to lend shield, blade, and rod to your aid.  These summoners can fight!  </p>
<p>In your heart you know this evil must be rooted out.  Children are dying as she feeds at night.  You know what you have to do.  You raise your fist to the sky and shout &#x201C;the Howlright Protectors are ready to serve the realm!  We shall be VICTORIOUS!&#x201D;  Your clan cheers banging the tables and clanking their weapons!</p>
<p>Aggroedius wishes you best fortune and you and your crew begin the steady march to Acid Lake and prepare to bring the beast to it&#x2019;s end.  You&#x2019;re haunted by this coming combat, but more haunted by a touch of bloodlust you saw in the eyes of Aggroedius&#x2026;  is he infected with the Burn?</p>

<h2 id="Steem-Monsters-is-auctioning-off-getting-placed-in-the-game-as-a-Boss-in-a-Boss-Fight"><a href="#Steem-Monsters-is-auctioning-off-getting-placed-in-the-game-as-a-Boss-in-a-Boss-Fight" class="headerlink" title="Steem Monsters is auctioning off getting placed in the game as a Boss in a Boss Fight"></a>Steem Monsters is auctioning off getting placed in the game as a Boss in a Boss Fight</h2><p>You can read more about this below, but the game will feature guilds and guilds can cooperate in PVP and PVE events.  PVP events include guild tournaments where guilds fight one another for glory and riches.  We&#x2019;ll also include PVE events where we&#x2019;ll provide challenges beyond Legendary cards that will take a whole guild of leveled bad asses to defeat.  These are Heroic Boss Monsters!</p>
<p>We want this game to be crafted not only with the players in mind, but with the actual players.  @berniesanders aka @nextgencrypto was the first to build the entire alpha set of cards.  We&#x2019;re going to put in an achievement into the game for folks who get every alpha card and call it &#x201C;Feed the Burn!&#x201D;  This is a pun that&#x2019;s both a reference to the desire to collect cards and also an homage to his nickname Bernie.</p>
<p>@reseller was the first that I know of to assemble a max level Summoner (possibly max level anything).  His Discord handle is reseller of souls.  I&#x2019;m planning on making the zippy 1-liner for Zintar &#x201C;Reseller of Souls.&#x201D;  What characters do in the game I will do my best to keep track of and keep building into the lore of the game.  You&#x2019;ll be etched into Steem Monsters immutably on the block.</p>
<h2 id="We&#x2019;re-looking-for-a-total-Boss"><a href="#We&#x2019;re-looking-for-a-total-Boss" class="headerlink" title="We&#x2019;re looking for a total Boss!"></a>We&#x2019;re looking for a total Boss!</h2><p>These guilds are going to need an epic challenge to face.  We want it to be you!  We&#x2019;re putting together an auction now so that you can be put into the game as the first Boss in the first Guild Boss fights.  We suspect that fighting itself will start in September.  Boss fights and guild fights may take longer.  That&#x2019;s also a product road map and it&#x2019;s in no way a product guarantee.  What is a promise is that we&#x2019;ll build you into the game, but the timeline is not completely known.  I&#x2019;m betting it&#x2019;s done before December.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#x2019;m going to accept a starting bid of 100 Steem to be put into the game as the very first Boss.  Every single guild is highly likely to fight your character many times  over the coming years.  The highest bid at the end of payout on this post will win the auction.  Money will go to @steemmonsters to fund development and tournament payouts.  In the event someone pledges more than they can pay or fails to pay their bid from the auction it will then proceed to the next highest bid.  If you&#x2019;re deliberately putting in bids you can&#x2019;t pay you&#x2019;ll be blacklisted from the game.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;ll work with you on designing a character backstory, a fight where you&#x2019;re the centerpiece, an image of what the fight looks like,  an image of you, and what kind of monster and ability set you want to have to kill all the newbs that dare to face you!  It&#x2019;s likely we&#x2019;ll try to build some comics and possibly some animations around this thing too.  You&#x2019;re going to feel like a heroic boss when the platform is all talking about you and how to defeat you!</p>
<p>This auction will result in some back and forth between me and the winner.  The text at the top of this post is simply a brief first pass to wet your appetite for what we have in mind.  We want you to bid, but we hope that you&#x2019;ll be a good partner in designing your character with us and not just send us money and a name and call it quits.  </p>
<p>There will be other auctions for cool stuff in the game, and you&#x2019;ll be able to get built in for doing epic things like being the first guild to kill this Boss.  There&#x2019;s going to be other opportunities to get in&#x2026; but there can only be one first Boss Fight in the game.  Will it be you?</p>

<h2 id="What-is-Steem-Monsters"><a href="#What-is-Steem-Monsters" class="headerlink" title="What is Steem Monsters?"></a>What is Steem Monsters?</h2><p>Steem Monsters is a collectible trading card drafting game with RPG elements based on the Steem Blockchain.  That&#x2019;s a mouthful&#x2026; Let&#x2019;s break it down.</p>
<p>Collectible trading card -  The game is currently in alpha and combat and auctions don&#x2019;t function yet, but we&#x2019;re working furiously to get there.  In the mean time you can get a feel for where we&#x2019;re taking this game.  You purchase the starter pack with 30 cards for $5 (this price will rise as we get more of the game developed).  It contains summoners who can summon monsters, and monsters that can fight for you.</p>
<p>Drafting-  The way the game is played is that you&#x2019;re choosing a summoner, using their mana to summon monsters of a certain mana cost, and those monsters will fight their opponents.  This game does not play like hearthstone or MTG where it&#x2019;s a card turn by turn.  It&#x2019;s more like a drafting system, like an NFL draft, where you&#x2019;re picking a team that you think will be victorious out of your roster versus teams of other summoners and monsters picked from their roster.</p>
<p>RPG elements-  All of the cards in the game will have the ability to level up as they gain experience.  Every fight they enter will award them one experience.  In a tournament they could win more than one experience by advancing rounds and entering new fights.  As the cards fight they will gain experience, which will lead to levels which will grant higher stats and greater abilities.</p>
<p>The cards have a level cap based on rarity.  Commons can go up to level 10 and take a total of 378 cards to get there.  Rares can reach level 8 and take a combined 85 cards to get there.  Epics can go to level 6 and take a combined 31 cards to get there, and LEGENDARY cards take 7 cards to reach max level 4.  You can pay money to buy decks and speed up getting to max level&#x2026; but you can&#x2019;t pass max level!</p>
<p>(Numbers were edited to reflect actual values, I had previous published just the number required for the last level)</p>
<h2 id="Modes-of-Play"><a href="#Modes-of-Play" class="headerlink" title="Modes of Play"></a>Modes of Play</h2><p>The game is in alpha.  The whole thing doesn&#x2019;t work yet.  This is a product road map so you can see where we&#x2019;re going.</p>
<p><strong>Dailies.</strong>  We envision a number of relatively easy daily quests that you can fight that will slowly earn you free packs for your daily commitment to play the game.<br><strong>Story line.</strong>  We imagine that you&#x2019;ll fight along a preset path of set opponents to earn packs and gear.  The combats will get progressively harder requiring better monsters and better strategy.<br><strong>PVP.</strong>  We&#x2019;ll offer two types of fighting here.  Free PVP and paid PVP.  Free PVP will be a steemmonsters sponsered tournament.  We&#x2019;l take money you give us for cards and put it into reward pools for the tournaments.  The first one in Beta I promise to make worth 1000 SBD to victors.  I&#x2019;ll try to make more and grow the prize pool over time.  We&#x2019;ll also offer paid PVP tournaments where like in poker you&#x2019;ll have a buy in and those who place will receive the combined pot as their winnings.<br><strong>Guilds.</strong>  We&#x2019;ll offer PVP and PVE.  You&#x2019;ll get together in groups (currently planning on 11 fighters) and you&#x2019;ll either smash other guilds in tournaments or smash preset bosses in boss fights.  Your guild will earn glory and riches for slaying one another or Heroic Boss Monsters.</p>
<h2 id="Fighting-is-simulated"><a href="#Fighting-is-simulated" class="headerlink" title="Fighting is simulated"></a>Fighting is simulated</h2><p>I just want to stress that this game does not play like MTG or Hearthstone.  It&#x2019;s a drafting game.  Those games are beyond the scope for the moment.  This is a game where you pick the team and the computer will simulate the fights in the tournament and spit out winners.  The game is highly strategic because it&#x2019;s all about the choices you make and how you equip your summoners and monsters and how you react to the meta (choices that your peers are consistently making).</p>
<h2 id="Story-in-the-game"><a href="#Story-in-the-game" class="headerlink" title="Story in the game"></a>Story in the game</h2><p>There will be some main story arcs and some fun story archs.  As the Legendary and epic cards level and significant events and achievements happen for you we&#x2019;ll reveal more of the central story.  As your other cards level we&#x2019;ll reveal some personal details and give you flavor for the monsters.  You won&#x2019;t get all stories at level 1. We&#x2019;ll build it so that as you level more and more details will be revealed about your monsters and about the whole story to the realm.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re writing stories for the game we&#x2019;ll build them into the game and we&#x2019;ll attribute your work and make sure that clickable links will bring people to your profile page!  Be sure to check out @steemmonsters for contests that are starting up and pop into submissions in the Discord to let us see or use your work.</p>
<h2 id="Success-so-far"><a href="#Success-so-far" class="headerlink" title="Success so far"></a>Success so far</h2><p>We&#x2019;ve sold over 10k booster packs and made over $30k dollars.  The announcement post hasn&#x2019;t even paid out yet.  This game is going to go insanely viral.  I&#x2019;m daunted and excited to deal with that.  You&#x2019;re gonna have fun.  You&#x2019;re gonna have people to play with.  Your cards will retain their value.  You&#x2019;re gonna want to be a part of this&#x2026; maybe you&#x2019;ll be a Heroic Boss Monster!</p>

<p>I may have just created an actually pegged asset&#x2026;  Can we just shoot the shit for a second on Monster Backed Dollars?</p>
<h2 id="What-am-I-talking-about"><a href="#What-am-I-talking-about" class="headerlink" title="What am I talking about?"></a>What am I talking about?</h2><p>Ok, I&#x2019;ve joked about creating Aggroed Backed Dollars.  It would be a commodity that would live on the blockchain and always represent exactly $1.  We can&#x2019;t do that with SBDs at this point because there are a lot of variables in the system and shit is super complicated.  There has been some debate over the reverse conversion, but it isn&#x2019;t pretty.  There isn&#x2019;t a clear consensus on what to do with it.  People want a stable currency because it&#x2019;s good for merchants.  Bloggers want a high SBD because it&#x2019;s good for post payouts.  Investors want a stable currency that sometimes spikes like crazy.  There are multiple stake holder groups and they want different shit.</p>
<p>So, it&#x2019;s ugly, and the fate of SBDs are unclear.</p>
<h2 id="Steem-Monsters"><a href="#Steem-Monsters" class="headerlink" title="Steem Monsters"></a>Steem Monsters</h2><p>I created Steem Monsters with @yabapmatt to just have a game&#x2026; we thought this thing would do well.  We had no idea it would explode like this.  Yaba says he thought it might happen&#x2026; I did too, but not alpha, and surely not before the intro post closed.  We&#x2019;re nearing $30k USD!  This is fucking unreal.</p>
<p>So, I&#x2019;m going to increase the price per starter kit.  I don&#x2019;t know when.  I&#x2019;m not in a rush.  Probably after each major milestone I&#x2019;ll increase the price.  So, next major one is auction house&#x2026; when that&#x2019;s ready I&#x2019;ll up it.  But the booster packs I have zero intention of raising the price on any time soon.  $2 is fair.  I&#x2019;m not here to overcharge&#x2026; but if that&#x2019;s a stable price point then there&#x2019;s some stuff we can do with it.</p>
<h2 id="MBD"><a href="#MBD" class="headerlink" title="MBD"></a>MBD</h2><p>Let&#x2019;s say we open up the option to buy a large volume of packs.  Maybe put in a discount to sweeten it some.  Price of Steem spikes and you want to take it out of volatile steem, but you don&#x2019;t want to put it in SBD because that&#x2019;s volatile too, and you don&#x2019;t want to move it into an exchange because you&#x2019;re gonna lose some anonymity, and you don&#x2019;t want to cash it out to USD using coinbase because you&#x2019;re worried about tax implications&#x2026; Maybe you&#x2019;re willing to use tether and Bittrex, but you also have some concerns about that.</p>
<p>Just hear me out for a second.  We&#x2019;re building an auction house.  What if you could buy 20k packs at a discount.  Then you could hodl them when the price of steem is high, sell them when it&#x2019;s low, and now you basically have a hedge against fluctuating prices.  Let&#x2019;s assume some buyers dried up&#x2026; you could start unpacking the cards and buying and selling legendaries etc.  You probably wouldn&#x2019;t want to do that for 20k packs&#x2026; but it could theoretically be an option.  The fact that we&#x2019;d be making bank on cards would allow us to pump tournament payouts through the roof and that would keep demand for cards and the game quite high.</p>
<p>Packs become the new $2 bill.  I&#x2019;m just spit ballin&#x2019; here.  But if we have thousands and thousands of users this could be a way to lock a currency price in place and it&#x2019;s digital asset backed.  How&#x2019;s that for a crazy idea?  Wanna trust your savings to bulk purchases of Steem Monster Booster Packs otherwise known as MBD?</p>

<p>ok, so I&#x2019;m like the most competitive person ever.  I can&#x2019;t help it.  I play a game with my 8 year old who can grab the other&#x2019;s nose first.  I try not to let her win even if she cries about it.  I&#x2019;m a little over competitive.  I try to hide it, and keep it to myself, but right now I have to share this tool that actually tells me what I want to know.  This used to all be on steemwhales.com and I loved that, but since heimi blew up huge with dtube he&#x2019;s had some other shit to do.</p>
<h2 id="Website"><a href="#Website" class="headerlink" title="Website"></a>Website</h2><p>So, today I&#x2019;m talking about mysteemitfriends.online.  It&#x2019;s a website that tracks cool data.  I came for follower count to know where I&#x2019;m currently ranked on the chain, but I&#x2019;ve found some other good shit too.  Here&#x2019;s what the site homepage looks like.</p>

<p>So, you have the ability to check quite a bit of stats.</p>
<h2 id="Let&#x2019;s-start-with-contributors"><a href="#Let&#x2019;s-start-with-contributors" class="headerlink" title="Let&#x2019;s start with contributors"></a>Let&#x2019;s start with contributors</h2><p>These are the folks that have helped me grow my account through posting.  Looks like I owe @canadian-coconut a slightly used mid sized sedan!</p>

<p>Looks like @aggroed has the 152nd most Steem Power of anyone on the block.  Looking to break top 100&#x2026;. thinking Steem Monsters is gonna help me do it.</p>
<h2 id="Reputation-possibly-the-most-important-stat"><a href="#Reputation-possibly-the-most-important-stat" class="headerlink" title="Reputation- possibly the most important stat"></a>Reputation- possibly the most important stat</h2><p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdCKgkdLR1Ckh7Ai2hu8vwGgs2DLTZDRjrCaVSr1E3x8y/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>here you can see Im&#x2019; rocking my rep of 74.37 putting me 43rd on the whole platform.  Rep has a lot to do with rewards you&#x2019;ve earned and who has hit you with them.  The fact that I&#x2019;m this high on the list usually means I&#x2019;ve gotten some sweet sweet voting love, and have escaped getting many flags</p>

<p>Ok, I have a social mission to spread peace, abundance, and liberty.  That means I have to have followers to receive and spread that mission.  This is the number that means the most to me.  As you can see I&#x2019;m at 29th highest follower count on the platform, but that&#x2019;s not a real number.  Folks like cryptoriddler have tons of followers they gain through f4f.  I tend to remove those bot like accounts when trying to come up with my actual follower count.  When I&#x2019;ve done that I count myself as 13th on the platform for follower count aka message spreading ability.  That&#x2019;s joyful news!  Gotta hit top 10 though.  Ned&#x2019;s only 2k follows ahead.  I bet I can sneak them out&#x2026; he doesn&#x2019;t post much!  He doesn&#x2019;t have monsters&#x2026;</p>
