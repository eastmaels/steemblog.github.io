<h1 id="3-Basic-Truths"><a href="#3-Basic-Truths" class="headerlink" title="3 Basic Truths"></a>3 Basic Truths</h1><p>In order to understand the foundations of the Non-Agression Principle, we can look at 3 basic truths.</p>
<p><strong>1. We exist</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Self-Ownership</strong><br>We are responsible and in control of the movements of our own bodies, therefore we are the owners of our bodies.</p>
<p><strong>3. We must be free in order to survive, fully live, and thrive</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We must have the freedom of movement to obtain sustenance</li>
<li>We must have the freedom of choice so that we are not slaves</li>
<li>We must have the freedom for self-actualization in order to thrive</li>
</ul>
<p>These 3 basic truths are the foundations for individual freedom, personal responsibility, and defense against acts of aggression.</p>
<h1 id="Empathy-and-War"><a href="#Empathy-and-War" class="headerlink" title="Empathy and War"></a>Empathy and War</h1><p>Something that I find disturbing is the way the general population seems to be accepting and detached when it comes to war, and I find the reason why to be even more disturbing.</p>
<p>With the exception of psychopaths and sociopaths, we all have some amount of empathy within us.<br>On a deeper level, we know that we are all the same&#x2026;.we are all just human.<br>It doesn&#x2019;t matter what country you are from or what religion you are. </p>
<p>We are all human.<br>This is the common thread that holds us all together.</p>
<p>Most of us absolutely find murder and killing horrible, sickening and absolutely unacceptable, so why is our reaction different when it comes to war?</p>
<p>The answer is a systematic desensitization by the Government who uses fear, propaganda, paranoia, and anger to dehumanize others and aggressively erase our empathy when it comes to how we view others.</p>
<p>They do this starting from childhood by teaching us that our country is the best and we are better than others, instilling a strong sense of nationalism and allegiance within us so that acts of war seem necessary, normal, and just.  As I&#x2019;ve stated before the modern education system in America is a weapon of mass destruction.  I&#x2019;m not anti-education&#x2026; that&#x2019;s empowering, but a system that teaches us &#x201C;the other&#x201D; is always an existential threat worthy of harm is a dangerous force.</p>

<p>So, I&#x2019;m all about seeing Steem get into the world at large.  Not just the crypto land, but also into the terrestrial world as well.  I&#x2019;m very keen on the idea that I can live, work, and function off of crypto.  I essentially believe the world is run by immoral banksters, and they operate the Federal Reserve.  Every time I use a dollar I give it value, and I would prefer alternatives.  Another one arrived today.</p>

I should risk some of those to test things out to help the ecosystem.  So, that&#x2019;s what I did.  I purchased a $100 amazon gift card.  It had $9.95 in fees.  At the time I paid 21.8SBD.  </p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmUeJNHPNkqPKiLX88hNf6SdoyCPK1cgtVHZw2DtuHHLUN/image.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmZE4YuHJGAH7C4Dk1ydpzg7Db5DX37K3TodZNyuVzxrWd/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I passed it along to muh wife, and now we have $100 more sitting in an Amazon account.  Seems like an excellent way to turn Steem into tangible goods with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>Nice job @xtrodinarypilot and team.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I&#x2019;m excited to get PAL-Studios up and running is that my educational background has a lot of theater in it.  When I was in college I mostly focused on getting out of college and completing a chemistry degree.  My parents were getting divorced and I wanted to be independent.  So, I pushed pretty hard to hard graduate in three years.  I have an intense work ethic and it came in handy.</p>
<p>I graduated from Bates, which is a liberal arts college up in Maine with lots of gen ed requirements with a chemistry degree.  If I had stayed around longer I was on track to have two minors as well: Education and Performance Art.  In the sales role I&#x2019;ve had I liked it specifically because it matched those interests: science, education, and performance.  That&#x2019;s what higher ed sales represents to me.  </p>
<p>In college I took a screen writing, play writing, performance art, had some radio shows, and for a science guy was kinda a theater kid.  I abandoned parts of this for a while, but wove it in.  I had a kickstarter game that raised 20k.  I made a movie for that.  At work I was asked to literally script some promotional videos.  I used my stuff for the sell out corporate version of art.</p>
<p>For education I&#x2019;ve been in private schools most of my life.  The only exception was graduate school when I went to Texas A&amp;M University.  Otherwise I&#x2019;ve had an exceptional education and feel the need to pay that forward.  I view education as a way to help improve the economic and social trajectory of people all over the world.  So, I took a fair number of education classes and even an independent study where I made a report about a high school in Maine and a unique approach they were taking to engaging students that was published in an academic journal.  </p>
<p>I used this education piece a lot in sales too.  Good sales in my book is highly consultative.  Here&#x2019;s the good, the bad, and the ugly about our product.  Get that from a competitor, and now you can make an informed decision.  To get the good, bad, and ugly I thought it would often take a lot of explaining of how things worked.  I got pretty good at doing that in a concise format, and had a ton of success selling by not selling and instead informing.</p>
<h2 id="PAL-Studios"><a href="#PAL-Studios" class="headerlink" title="PAL-Studios "></a>PAL-Studios </h2><h2></h2><p>I guess this is a round about way to say I&#x2019;m not a total scrub when it comes to film and production.  I&#x2019;ve been doing some of this since high school.  Yes I&#x2019;m rusty.  Yes the tools are new, but this isn&#x2019;t a completely brand new interest.  I&#x2019;ve been doing performance theater for 20 years.  So, that&#x2019;s part of what&#x2019;s driving this.  If the diagram I&#x2019;ve been operating under is</p>

Immoral banksters broke it.  They have purchased government, and made the system a giant wealth sucking mechanism from the poor to the uber rich.  The scoreboard shows about 12 people have as much wealth as 3 billion.  I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s because they are 10^9 better than anyone else.  I just think they made a system that involves systemic theft.  They use a giant spynet and violence to profit and protect that system.  The world has to change and that change has to start with me.</p>
<p>So, this is the journey that I&#x2019;m on.  And not that people are saying much of &#x201C;Aggroed you dumb fuck you can&#x2019;t do this,&#x201D; but I wanted to share where I&#x2019;m coming from as I put more puzzle pieces in place for PAL-Studios.</p>

<p>So, I&#x2019;ve been trying to do some more curation.  I&#x2019;m still not great at it, but I&#x2019;m voting and resteeming.  I&#x2019;m trying to read and comment more.  I think there really isn&#x2019;t a substitute for manual content, project, and people discovery on the platform.  I do have a few people on an auto-voter because I believe that supporting them and their posts at all times is the right thing for the platform.  It&#x2019;s open to change, but not any time soon.</p>
<h2 id="Who-should-be-curating"><a href="#Who-should-be-curating" class="headerlink" title="Who should be curating? "></a>Who should be curating? </h2><h2></h2><p>Everyone should curate to some extent.  Well, anyone that&#x2019;s trying to grow on the platform.  If this is just a passive investment then it doesn&#x2019;t really matter, but if you want to grow your account by posting you usually have to interact too.  </p>
<h2 id="Who-does-it-finicially-benefit-to-curate"><a href="#Who-does-it-finicially-benefit-to-curate" class="headerlink" title="Who does it finicially benefit to curate? "></a>Who does it finicially benefit to curate? </h2><h2></h2><p>The people that have the most to gain from curation are the whales.  That&#x2019;s happening at multiple levels.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How much a currency is worth depends on how many people use it.  As more folks use it and more goods and services are traded it increases the value of a currency.  Whales that want to see their value go up have an interest in curating well and helping this platform find good people and good content so we continue to attract and retain new members.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Curation has a pig pile effect.  If you upvote a post early and lots of other people follow you can make some serious money.  To do that you need some SP or you can&#x2019;t earn much, but quality curation on the site can net you some bucks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="What-about-smaller-accounts"><a href="#What-about-smaller-accounts" class="headerlink" title="What about smaller accounts "></a>What about smaller accounts </h2><h2></h2><p>This is less about big pay days and more about building steady income on the platform.  By voting others you&#x2019;re more likely to catch votes from others.  As your account grows you can typically attract larger votes.  While you can gain more money in the short term by upvoting your own place holder content you then really depend just on yourself for making money here.  If you can share the wealth with others you&#x2019;re likely to grow faster and catch more votes and followers.  Even if you don&#x2019;t have a huge stake you can swim in your pond and find a community of people that have some similar interests and SP reserves.  You&#x2019;re not gonna get rich over night, but you can build it up!</p>
<h2 id="Types-of-Curation"><a href="#Types-of-Curation" class="headerlink" title="Types of Curation "></a>Types of Curation </h2><h2></h2><p>The two broad categories are manual and automatic.  Manual curation involves upvoting and commenting on content and people that you like.  Autovoters is just a set it and forget it kind of thing.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmYefcx7cRB2TvsrGRUwLX2vNQXAnpTTkRUeyPwPZEv65Y/image.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-best"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-best" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s best? "></a>What&#x2019;s best? </h2><h2></h2><p>I happen to think it&#x2019;s best to do a mix.</p>
<ul>
<li>I like to have voting power left to upvote people that comment on my posts</li>
<li>I like to have autovotes on people that I think are wonderful.  Here&#x2019;s looking at you @kaylinart.  I wouldn&#x2019;t be successful here without your help and you can always count on me for a steady upvote on your posts.  You&#x2019;re awesome and I&#x2019;m very grateful.</li>
<li>I like to have a stash of voting power to upvote content I see in my feed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="I-think-people-that-are-routinely-curated-stick-around-more"><a href="#I-think-people-that-are-routinely-curated-stick-around-more" class="headerlink" title="I think people that are routinely curated stick around more "></a>I think people that are routinely curated stick around more </h2><h2></h2><p>We have a curation team out of the Minnow Support Project now.  A team of moderators and long time members are now using communal voting power to upvote posts.  This has done a few things.  It meant that we can move moderator curation off of @minnowsupport leaving that simply as a tool for minnows to get started on the platform.  (If you don&#x2019;t know the Minnow Support Project has a Discord channel called the <a href="minnowpond.org">Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network</a> and you can register with a bot, then use a command to get a small upvote from the @minnowsupport account and a small voting trail that follows it.)   This leaves more VP for minnows.</p>
<h2 id="So-I&#x2019;m-helping-that-effort"><a href="#So-I&#x2019;m-helping-that-effort" class="headerlink" title="So, I&#x2019;m helping that effort "></a>So, I&#x2019;m helping that effort </h2><h2></h2><p>I had previously pledged 10k SP to msp-curation.  @ausbitbank kicked in a few k so I was able to get it up to 10k SP total, but I wanted to complete the delegation I promised.  So, here it is.  I&#x2019;ve added another 3,000.  The account is now sitting at a little over 13,000SP.</p>
<h2 id="isaria-and-juliakponsford-are-leading-the-effort"><a href="#isaria-and-juliakponsford-are-leading-the-effort" class="headerlink" title="@isaria and @juliakponsford are leading the effort "></a>@isaria and @juliakponsford are leading the effort </h2><h2></h2><p>There&#x2019;s a full team of I believe 7 people curating a variety of topics.  Each person gets a set of the VP to use.  It&#x2019;s a gift to say welcome to the community.  So, we&#x2019;re curating around 50-60 posts a week manually.  We&#x2019;re not as large as @acidyo&#x2019;s OCD team or have that much stake, but we started with a different purpose and fulfill many missions in addition to curation.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s who is doing the curation:</p>
<p>music&#x2026; @isaria<br>art&#x2026; @juliakponsford<br>new steemians&#x2026; @ma1neEvent<br>philosophy&#x2026; @clayboyn<br>writing/poetry. @sunravelme<br>finance/crypto&#x2026; @scaredycatguide<br>sustainability. @torico<br>science/tech&#x2026; @jrswab<br>PAL&#x2026; @creativesoul<br>life/travel&#x2026;@rougebot</p>
<h2 id="More-to-come"><a href="#More-to-come" class="headerlink" title="More to come "></a>More to come </h2><h2></h2><p>There will be some more formal details from @isaria and @minnowsupport, but in the mean time I just wanted to share that I met my pledged obligation to this aspect of the project.</p>
<h2 id="Up-next"><a href="#Up-next" class="headerlink" title="Up next? "></a>Up next? </h2><h2></h2><p>I have a short term goal of getting @patrice and @anyx a 1k delegation for steemcleaners.  I wanted to host something like it in the Minnow Support Project, but it seems a little out of scope.  So, for now I&#x2019;ll defer to them.  They have a good system and do a great job.</p>
<h2 id="After-that"><a href="#After-that" class="headerlink" title="After that? "></a>After that? </h2><h2></h2><p>I want to make it so listening to msp-waves is profitable!  So, sometime in February I&#x2019;ll have some Steem Power saved up.  I&#x2019;m going to cancel all my individual delegations, and I&#x2019;m going to make a separate autovoting account for people that listen to msp-waves.  There&#x2019;s some process and stuff to figure out there, but rather than support folks that listened and won delegations on the radio through direct delegations I&#x2019;m going to support them with autovotes.  When I switch I want to make sure that I have more SP than the sum of the delegations I&#x2019;m taking so even though they are losing a delegation it should feel like they are getting a lot in return so it doesn&#x2019;t sting as much.  All told I&#x2019;m hoping it&#x2019;s around 15k SP in February or March!</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m thinking after that I&#x2019;ll increase msp-mods a few thousand and then start working on an pal-studios as an account!</p>

<p>Hey everyone.  Aggroed here.  I&#x2019;m pretty excited.  I just picked up some new equipment to get some video content made.  This is an early stage action of trying to put together a complete studio I&#x2019;m calling PAL-Studios.  I&#x2019;ve started today with a Sony FDR-AX100.  I know it&#x2019;s oversized and over priced from where I need to start, but I&#x2019;m trying to future proof myself a little bit by having a camera that could conceivably take footage for indy media above and beyond talking head videos.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmPaEkLNRjHy9YdjagQHwEVcBco3KwaJyALGf4p9rGFstP/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I purchased a tripod.  THis is the Manfrotto 290.  It has a ball bearing head which makes for some steady movement on the tripod.  Again, way more than what I need for a talking head video, but for skits and other media I think it will be nice.</p>
<p>I topped the camera off with a SONY Gunzoom microphone.  I can hear the difference between the onboard mic and a more professional mic.  This one sounds pretty good.  Other mics are somewhat more standard in the industry but SONY decided to make it proprietary on the quick connect on the top and now standard mics don&#x2019;t work on it.  You have to buy SONY&#x2026; fuckers&#x2026;</p>
<p>I have some small scale lighting which I picked up from Best Buy, but I&#x2019;m pretty sure I&#x2019;m going to upgrade that with some lights by Cool Lights.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ll need a new computer, a desk, a chair, a lease, and a internet access point from the warehouse still.  I&#x2019;m getting closer.</p>
<p>As I mention in the video the plan is to continue to create content that will spread the message of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  You can expect a fair amount of it to be snarky towards the status quo.  Should be fun.  Please stick with and stand by me as we move into a new evolution and bring a media production studio to Steem for the Steem community!</p>

<p>So, what do you think?  Did we hit bottom?  Or are we still lining up for another big drop?  Is this naught but the upward acceleration caused by forceful ricochet of a deceased feline being propelled upward from the nadir post prolonged attitudinal plunge? (dead cat bounce) </p>
<p>Traders will talk about only two feelings that drive all price movements: greed and fear.  At 9k I&#x2019;m not fearful of much.  When I check the <a href="https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/bitcoin-mayer-multiple/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mayer Multiple </a> I see that the average of the 200 day moving price average of BTC would be $9,357.  So, we got pretty close to that, and I think investors started getting really comfortable buying BTC again at those levels.  My fear subsided.</p>
<p>Now I&#x2019;m starting to get greedy.  So, personally, I think we just hit bottom.  I&#x2019;m considering taking money I shouldn&#x2019;t risk and buying in.  I&#x2019;m married&#x2026; so I don&#x2019;t imagine this is going to happen, but that&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;m feeling.  So, I have to imagine that others are getting out of panic sell mode and into &#x201C;What kind of sweet deals can I get today?&#x201D;</p>
<p>How are you feeling right now?</p>

I think we&#x2019;re undervalued, and the updates we have coming are going to open the door to ridiculous success!  </p>

<li>HF20: Velocity: No more waiting weeks for a new account!  Onboarding will be vastly improved.</li>
<li>Communities: Want an account for your business, organization, or religious group?  We got you covered!</li>
<li>SMTs: We&#x2019;re going to tokenize the internet.  It&#x2019;s going to make Steem an increidbly attractive coin.</li>
<li>Mobile app: Steemit is going to release a mobile app this year too making the Steem blockchain easily accessible for everyone everywhere!</li>

<p>$50 steem anyone?  That&#x2019;s my bet for the end of the year!</p>
<h2 id="608-404"><a href="#608-404" class="headerlink" title="608,404 "></a>608,404 </h2><h2></h2><p>Pre price pump and pre hardfork I put out a post saying that we&#x2019;ll have 2M accounts by the end of the year.  We just added our 608,404th user and probably more while I sit here typing this.  I think 2M may be conservative if all 4 of the above launch this year.  I think you can expect top 300 Alexa, over 100k active users per day, several million accounts, and Steem entering the top 10 coins in 2018.  </p>
<h2 id="A-vicious-upward-cycle"><a href="#A-vicious-upward-cycle" class="headerlink" title="A vicious upward cycle "></a>A vicious upward cycle </h2><h2></h2><p>As the price of steem increases the number of people who want to blog will increase.  As they blog there will be more demand for price, which will drive more users here.  </p>
<p>As a matter of fact the driving force for this is platform inflation delivered to active users through content creation and curation.  In terms of widespread adoption of coins it&#x2019;s this inflation that&#x2019;s driving growth.  There are some whales that don&#x2019;t care for this inflation much, but I think it&#x2019;s underpinning a lot of our growth and success.  That&#x2019;s why I want to set it at 10% and leave it unchanged.</p>
