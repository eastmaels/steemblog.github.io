<p>If you missed the first post in the series check it out here: <a href="https://steemit.com/minnowsupportproject/@aggroed/minnow-support-project-weekly-minnow-resteem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/minnowsupportproject/@aggroed/minnow-support-project-weekly-minnow-resteem</a></p>
<p>After having my own follower count explode after having been shared by some highly followed characters on steemit; @fyrstikken and @kaylinart, I decided I wanted to pay it forward and start a weekly resteem.  Going forward the plan is to post a new Minnow Support Project on Monday so folks can post links to their articles in the comments.  Then I&#x2019;ll announce winners, pay winners, and resteem posts on Thursdays.  This first week it started on a Thursday so it didn&#x2019;t quite work like that, but going forward it will.</p>
<h2 id="So-here-are-the-rules"><a href="#So-here-are-the-rules" class="headerlink" title="So, here are the rules "></a>So, here are the rules </h2><h2></h2><p>For every 100 upvotes I&#x2019;ll resteem a follower<br>To be able to get a resteem simply link your post (or a referral if you want) in the comments section. Make sure there are at least 3 days left on the post rewards because I&#x2019;m not going to resteem right away.<br>The first resteem is the post that gets the most upvotes, comments that have been robo voted are likely to be excluded.<br>The second resteem is the post I think is best.  I&#x2019;m judging by what will support my mission of Peace, Abundance and Liberty.<br>Third vote and up is based on the post with the highest rewards.</p>
<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-a-minnow"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-a-minnow" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s a minnow? "></a>What&#x2019;s a minnow? </h2><h2></h2><p>Others may have different definitions than mine, but for the purpose of this contest a minnow is anyone that at the time they post in the comment section have less than 5,000SP and under 500 followers.</p>
<h2 id="Winners"><a href="#Winners" class="headerlink" title="Winners! "></a>Winners! </h2><h2></h2><p>First winner comes from @fraenk for their beautiful photography- <a href="https://steemit.com/colorchallenge/@fraenk/colorchallenge-sevendayssevencolors-my-whole-week-summed-up-spoiler-i-made-my-first-100usd-on-steemit-yay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/colorchallenge/@fraenk/colorchallenge-sevendayssevencolors-my-whole-week-summed-up-spoiler-i-made-my-first-100usd-on-steemit-yay</a></p>
<p>Second winner comes from @jdawg for his post about diversifying out of the USD- <a href="https://steemit.com/money/@jdawg/diversify-out-of-the-dollar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/money/@jdawg/diversify-out-of-the-dollar</a></p>
<p>I&#x2019;m going to send 20SBD to @fraenk and 10SBD to @jdawg!</p>
<h2 id="Congratulations"><a href="#Congratulations" class="headerlink" title="Congratulations "></a>Congratulations </h2><h2></h2><p>I hope I can help you out as much as some follower whales helped me.  Be sure to tune in on Monday and get your posts linked early for your best chance to win!</p>
<p>Lastly, I&#x2019;ll be announcing a witness campaign next week.  Please support me!</p>

            <p><img src="https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_h/ISmi46l30q7c931000000000.jpg" alt=""><br>Well put down your drinks because this story should have a couple spit takes.  I&#x2019;m the second investor to help @picokernel buy a house.  He&#x2019;s an 18 year old steemit employee living down in VA and he&#x2019;s going to buy a house.  I heard about this plan on Discord&#x2019;s Steemspeak channel.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s the rough plan.  @picokernel is going to crowd source some cash to buy to house.  He&#x2019;s going to own a home where he can commute to Steemit.  He&#x2019;ll buy some shares himself as part of the down payment, but he&#x2019;ll buy the tokens back over time!</p>
<p>He called the bank this morning and shared the call with the banker on the other end of the line.  Fuckin&#x2019; hilarious.  Some highlights.</p>
<p>Bankster: So, where do you work?<br>@picokernel: Steemit<br>Bankster: Do you have a W2?<br>@picokernel: Not right now.  I&#x2019;m still in school, I have a bunch of bitcoin.  Have you heard of Bitcoin?<br>Bankster: yes, I&#x2019;ve heard of it&#x2026;  It&#x2019;s been on the news.  Where do you go to school?<br>@picokernel: I&#x2019;m still in high school.<br>Bankster- shit hits pants&#x2026;  Pause&#x2026;<br>@picokernel: I&#x2019;m raising the money, we&#x2019;ll be able to pay.  Do you think we can make this work?<br>Bankster: pause&#x2026; Yes I think so!!!</p>
<p>There is a full recording.  I&#x2019;ll post the link in this post-  <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B57iVnbv2heONHh3c19SSHdyQ0k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B57iVnbv2heONHh3c19SSHdyQ0k</a></p>
<p>So, I like @picokernel.  I wanted to be part of this.  @fyrstikken beat me to being the first investor.  But I&#x2019;m the second.  If you&#x2019;d like to get in on this part of history contact @picokernel and chill out with us in Discord.</p>

<p>Here&#x2019;s @fyrstikken &#x2018;s post- <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit-house/@fyrstikken/i-bought-the-first-shares-in-the-natestate-nest-the-first-house-on-the-blockchain-a-home-for-picokernel-in-va-co-owned-by-all-of" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/steemit-house/@fyrstikken/i-bought-the-first-shares-in-the-natestate-nest-the-first-house-on-the-blockchain-a-home-for-picokernel-in-va-co-owned-by-all-of</a></p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s Nate&#x2019;s explanation:</p>
<p>&#x201C;So basically, I am buying a house with my own funds and some of these pre ico funds<br>and when I buy put a down payment on the house and officially own it, I will release the ICO and give everyone who already paid there tokens<br>so with these tokens, you own a share of the house<br>and when I sell the house, you will be entitled to a portion of whatever I sell it for<br>so if I buy the house at $175,000<br>I will issue 175,000 nest tokens<br>and if I sell the house at $180,000, I will buy back all the tokens for that new price<br>and also being a shareholder has perks because you can vote on certain things<br>like if we want to install a pool because we think that&#x2019;ll improve the value&#x201D;</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s a diagram that may help clarify the plan.<br><img src="https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmdzFjxsRFbrEuYwGjHyJs7sF74iiMrUp6kQDQKbzDyYyX/NatesHouse.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Being a witness has a lot to do with understanding economics.  Here I&#x2019;m going to outline my basic understanding of economics and how it relates to Steemit currencies through the lens of my mission statement with a current issue as an example.  Yes, this is what I choose to do on a long weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/missionstatement/@aggroed/my-steemit-mission-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/missionstatement/@aggroed/my-steemit-mission-statement</a></p>
<h2 id="The-value-of-a-currency-is-proportional-to-the-amount-of-goods-and-services-provided"><a href="#The-value-of-a-currency-is-proportional-to-the-amount-of-goods-and-services-provided" class="headerlink" title="The value of a currency is proportional to the amount of goods and services provided "></a>The value of a currency is proportional to the amount of goods and services provided </h2><h2></h2><p>Ok, so this post is going to have some equations.  I&#x2019;m sorry.  But this is an economics post and I&#x2019;ll try to use only basic math rather than calculus or something more complicated.</p>
<h2 id="Total-Currency-Value-&#x221D;-Total-Goods-and-Services"><a href="#Total-Currency-Value-&#x221D;-Total-Goods-and-Services" class="headerlink" title="Total Currency Value &#x221D; Total Goods and Services "></a>Total Currency Value &#x221D; Total Goods and Services </h2><h2></h2><p>&#x221D; means proportional</p>
<p>This is considered a direct relationship.  If your good and services goes up then your total currency value goes up.  If your total currency value goes up then you are able to purchase more goods and services with it.</p>
<p>Both sides of this equation get more complex!</p>
<h2 id="Total-Currency-Value-is-the-combined-value-of-Steem-Power-Steem-and-SBD"><a href="#Total-Currency-Value-is-the-combined-value-of-Steem-Power-Steem-and-SBD" class="headerlink" title="Total Currency Value is the combined value of Steem Power, Steem, and SBD "></a>Total Currency Value is the combined value of Steem Power, Steem, and SBD </h2><h2></h2><p>To figure out the total value it&#x2019;s the sum of total SP, S, and SBD value.  </p>
<p>That means it&#x2019;s SP times the value of SP plus the amount of S times the value of S plus the amount of SBD times the value of SBD.</p>
<p>XVSP + YVS +ZVSBD =  Total Currency value<br>X= number of SP in existence<br>VSP= value of SP<br>Y= Number of Steem<br>VS= Value of Steem<br>Z= Number of SBD<br>VSBD= Value of SBD</p>
<h2 id="A-gauge-for-goods-and-services"><a href="#A-gauge-for-goods-and-services" class="headerlink" title="A gauge for goods and services "></a>A gauge for goods and services </h2><h2></h2><p>The amount of goods and services is the total output of the economy.  So, you add up all the physical stuff produced.  Then you tack on all the services (labor) that was sold.  While it&#x2019;s not perfect I think the fastest and easiest way to approximate total economic output is to figure out how many people are in your economy.  People purchase goods and labor.  People provide labor.  So, the number of people is a pretty easy handle to figure out your total economy size.  Furthermore, the rule of thumb in crypto is that you can approximate the number of people by the number of transactions in that currency per day.  So, it&#x2019;s pretty easy to track on the block chain how many transactions there are per day so it&#x2019;s a really easy metric.</p>
<p>The right side looks like this</p>
<p>Amount of Goods and Services &#x221D; Amount of People &#x221D; Number of  transactions</p>
<p>So, my new total equation looks like this</p>
<p>XVSP + YVS +ZVSBD &#x221D; Number of Transactions</p>
<h2 id="Let&#x2019;s-run-through-some-hypotheticals"><a href="#Let&#x2019;s-run-through-some-hypotheticals" class="headerlink" title="Let&#x2019;s run through some hypotheticals "></a>Let&#x2019;s run through some hypotheticals </h2><h2></h2><ol>
<li>Steem is cool and more people use it.  The number of transactions increase.  What happens to the value of the currencies?<br>With more transactions, more people, and more goods/services and assuming the amount of currency in circulation stays the same then the value of the currency will go up.  Currency deflation</li>
<li>Steem is uncool and less people use it.  THe nuber of transactions decrease.  What happens to the value of the currency/?<br>With less good and services your currency is now in excess supply.  That means it will take more of it to purchase something.  Currency inflation.</li>
<li>Steemit prints a shit ton of coin but the amount of goods/services stay the same.  This is inflation.  There are now more coins in circulation than the amount of good and servies so the value of each coin will drop.</li>
<li>Steemit stops printing coins and people destroy or lose some while the amount of goods and services stays unchanged.  This is deflation.  There are less coins in circulation so it will take less of them to purchase the goods and services that one can buy.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-happening-in-the-real-world"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-happening-in-the-real-world" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s happening in the real world? "></a>What&#x2019;s happening in the real world? </h2><h2></h2><p>Steemit increases coins in circulation at a rate of 10% annually.  That&#x2019;s 24million coins this year.  The total size of the American GDP is 19T dollars.   World GDP is between $75-110T.  So, STEEM only has 0.000032% of the amount of currency in play.  This is to say we temporarily have a very small marketshare of the amount of goods and services traded in steem.  We&#x2019;re in a super tiny pond and with events like 1btc&gt;1ozgold crypto is going through mainstreaming and expansions.  Because this thing is easy, cool, and popular it&#x2019;s going to keep increasing the size of the economy it&#x2019;s involved in.  </p>
<p>So, the value of steem in circulation is slowly increasing (barely perceptible increase), but every time another company, industry, trading group, or nation comes to steemit the total goods and services provided takes a giant leap up.  These kinds of changes are putting a very strong upward pressure on the price of steem currencies.</p>
<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-the-issue"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-the-issue" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s the issue? "></a>What&#x2019;s the issue? </h2><h2></h2><p>One of the big questions that witnesses are coping with is &#x201C;SBD is worth more than 1 USD.  What should we do?&#x201D;</p>
<p>We basically have two options.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get rid of the 1SBD=1USD peg and let the currency value go up.</li>
<li>Inflate the currency as new people come on board to keep SBDs around 1USD..</li>
</ol>
<p>There are various approaches to each.</p>
<p>Who are the stakeholders?</p>
<ol>
<li>Steem currency holders.  Arguably the most powerful group.  Investors want the currency they hold to go up in value.</li>
<li>Merchants-  These peeps just want a stable currency.  Thats really fricki&#x2019; hard in crypto land, but it&#x2019;s understandable.  If you want to sell a shirt in SBD you don&#x2019;t want the value of the SBD fluctuating all day.  Boom and bust isn&#x2019;t safe for business.</li>
<li>New folks.  These guys don&#x2019;t really have a voice, but we have to consider them as we want this place to grow.  They want it to be easy to understand.  They want to be able to buy in.  They want a distribution that doesn&#x2019;t give all the power to a handful of people.</li>
<li>Authors and curators.  These guys want their posts and curation to have value.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what&#x2019;s my answer to the problem?</p>
<center> XVSP + YVS +ZVSBD &#x221D; Number of Transactions </center>

<p>As long as number of transactions (new people, and new good and services) is going up the value of the currencies is going to go up.  But they don&#x2019;t have to go up equally.  I think the answer is to hardfork and change how SBD is generated.  I think that&#x2019;s the best pressure release valve.  I don&#x2019;t want steem flying through the roof. That will exacerbate the problem with concentration of wealth into whales.  I don&#x2019;t want to hurt merchants by letting all this shit freely fluctuate.  I think the answer is that when the value of the SBD goes up then steemit starts cranking out more SBDs, but the inflation of steem and Steem Power stays at the current planned rate.</p>
<p>The current plan is to put downward pressure on SBDs, but it&#x2019;s no match for the expansion crypto is going through now that 1 BTC&gt; 1Oz. Gold.  So, I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s going to do what they think it&#x2019;s going to do.</p>
<p><img src="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/010/692/19789999.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If we crank out SBD when it&#x2019;s above $1USD while not increasing the amount of steem and Steem power then the 4 stake holding groups are happy.  </p>
<p>The investors are happy because the steem/SP won&#x2019;t inflate like crazy, should have some scarcity, and will continue to go up in value.<br>The merchants are happy because they can sell in SBD and not go through boom and bust.<br>The newbies come along because steem is easy to understand and the system&#x2019;s distribution doesn&#x2019;t get worse.<br>The authors and curators are happy because they&#x2019;ll get paid a lot of SBD for their posts.</p>

<p>As I write this I&#x2019;ve already started the work to get my witness account established.  It&#x2019;s not up and running yet, but it will be shortly.  While having a witness is nice, and asking people to vote for my witness is neat, I think it&#x2019;s critical to talk about plans, what I stand for, where I want things to head, and provide a complete overview of why someone should actually upvote my witness.</p>
<h2 id="I-worked-in-a-sustainable-marketing-role-and-worked-out-using-the-ethos-of-sustainability-how-I-make-sustainable-decisions"><a href="#I-worked-in-a-sustainable-marketing-role-and-worked-out-using-the-ethos-of-sustainability-how-I-make-sustainable-decisions" class="headerlink" title="I worked in a sustainable marketing role and worked out using the ethos of sustainability how I make sustainable decisions "></a>I worked in a sustainable marketing role and worked out using the ethos of sustainability how I make sustainable decisions </h2><h2></h2><p>So, I had a unique role in one of the companies that I worked for where I was running excel spreadsheets all day trying to calculate the life cycle cost of a product versus the environmental impact, and social benefit.  This is often referred to as sustainability and the triple bottom line.  You want a product that will cost less over time relative to competitors, will reduce negative impacts on the environment, and will help the social area in which the product is used and created.  It was a wonderful role (other than the fact that the guy running the program was ironically an unstable racist and religiously intolerant ass wipe).</p>
<p>One of things that really struck me is that a business shouldn&#x2019;t have a business plan and a sustainability plan.  The business should have 1 plan it&#x2019;s working off of that incorporates elements of sustainable development.  While working through why some of the products and manufacturing facilities were able to achieve sustainability and others were not it often came down to leadership&#x2019;s ability to merge the two plans into one rather than have a business plan they followed and a sustainability plan they ignored.</p>
<p>So, I came up with the model up at the top there to figure out how to address problems.  </p>
<ol>
<li>Mission Statement: Have a written document concisely expressing your goals to clearly outline what you value.</li>
<li>Problem Statement: You have something that you&#x2019;re trying to fix.  Describe the problem and talk about the impacts of the probelm</li>
<li>Vision Statement: Provide a clear vision of what the future should look like and what the benefits of those changes will be on end users.</li>
<li>Plan:  (In this case a Witness Plan) Once you have a vision you have to figure out where you are now and then outline steps you&#x2019;ll take to move the dial towards the vision.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Mission-statement"><a href="#Mission-statement" class="headerlink" title="Mission statement "></a>Mission statement </h2><h2></h2><p>If you missed the post I&#x2019;ve already written up a Mission statement.  It boils down to help new people on the platform.<br><a href="https://steemit.com/missionstatement/@aggroed/my-steemit-mission-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/missionstatement/@aggroed/my-steemit-mission-statement</a></p>
<h2 id="Problem-Statement"><a href="#Problem-Statement" class="headerlink" title="Problem Statement  "></a>Problem Statement  </h2><h2></h2><p>World Issues-  The world does not have too few governments and currencies, but quite the opposite.  The world needs more.  There are currently seven billion people organized by only ~170 governments.  That equates to roughly 41M people/government.  That sounds strikingly like a monopoly.  Similarly, there aren&#x2019;t nearly enough currency creation centers.  Back in the mid 1800s there were many institutions that were creating currency.  It was called the &#x201C;Era of Free Banking,&#x201D; which also suggests that they aren&#x2019;t free now, which implies we have enslaved banking.<br>Companies used to issue currencies.  Hell people could issue currencies if they could back them.  But that doesn&#x2019;t happen anymore.  There&#x2019;s only 180 &#x201C;major&#x201D; currencies in the world right now.  There are trillions of USD of trade, but only 180 ways that they are commonly traded.  It doesn&#x2019;t make sense on the world stage.  Especially when one realizes that basically all of it is going through organizations like the Bank of International Settlements.<br>It also doesn&#x2019;t make sense on the small stage.  Regardless of which bank I work with at home they all get little numbers on their screens from the Federal Reserve.  You might think you&#x2019;re only banking with your local credit union, but they get the fiat notes from the same place BoA does.  You can&#x2019;t escape the FED with &#x201C;normal&#x201D; currencies.<br>So, to summarize there&#x2019;s too much power concentrated in the hands of too few currencies and governments.</p>
<p>Steemit Issues- My complaint since the mass inflation of this product and possibly before that was the distribution seems fairly unethical to me.  On the one hand I&#x2019;m furious in the real world that banksters have rigged a system to shove all the wealth to the top 1% of the world and then here I&#x2019;m finding that while the platform seems to democracize wealth creation it has a worse concentration of wealth than the Federal Reserve does now.  I think it&#x2019;s entirely likely that as the price rises steadily as it is incorporated into more exchanges (like the btcc poll going on right meow) that the distribution is only going to get worse.</p>
<p>Sadly, the way that voting happens on this platform also seems to concentrate wealth into the hands of relatively few people.  Because of the reputation system posts by high reputation authors can make hundreds in seconds while posts written by newbs make nothing over weeks.  While there are currently thousands of authors and only a handful of highly tracked accounts from what I can tell a very high portion of the author rewards are going to a very slim distribution of authors.</p>
<p>Lastly, this platform is a highly technical endeavor.  Computer Science stuff doesn&#x2019;t come naturally to just about everyone on the planet.  So, if you&#x2019;d like to be a miner, a witness, or have other types of input than authoring and curating it isn&#x2019;t actually all that possible.  </p>
<h2 id="Vision-Statement"><a href="#Vision-Statement" class="headerlink" title="Vision Statement "></a>Vision Statement </h2><h2></h2><p>I envision of capitalist world were goods and services are traded between people without third parties taking a slice, without currencies being de jure backed by floating armadas with WMDS, and where people have the ability to voluntarily contract with government services organization and companies to purchase the goods and services that improve their lives.  I imagine homes will be purchased and traded with the occupant becoming the owner rather than a tenant.  I imagine a world where competition thrives and is able to destroy government enabled monopolies that disadvantage consumers.  I see a world where those born with a strong will and a smart mind will have the ability to advance far beyond their initial circumstances.  I see a peaceful world, I see an abundant world, and I see a world where you can Be and Do as you please so long as it causes no harm.</p>
<p>The most important part of that is upon creation of currency it is done so without debt attached.  Debts fine everywhere else, but not upon creation, because it&#x2019;s financial slavery.  </p>
<h2 id="Witness-Plan"><a href="#Witness-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Witness Plan "></a>Witness Plan </h2><h2></h2><p>That&#x2019;s a lofty goal.  It may seem a little out of reach at the moment, but we can as a community who see value in this plan can chip away it.  Here are some immediate priorities.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Help newcomers to the site get up and running as quickly as possible.  This should include helping them to author, to trade, to curate, to mine, and to witness.  Small things like extending the viewable range of witness accounts beyond 50 so that newcomers have an easier chance to be seen and compete with more established witnesses can be implemented.  This can also be accomplished by publishing guides written by competent programmers and translating them to a point where absolute beginners can start.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Help distribute wealth generated on the platform and held within the platform more equitably.  This won&#x2019;t involve taking from one against their will to give to another, but will include fighting to maximize the value that each person brings to this community while being wary of bots that impersonate people and mostly benefit the technocrats at the exclusion of new steemers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Expand the scope of the Minnow Support Project to help get authors not only more money in a post, but exposure to a larger audience to build sustainable growth.</p>
</li>
</ol>
