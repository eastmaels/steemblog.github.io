<p>So, I work in sales.  In sales we have to make forecasts.  I&#x2019;m making one now.  Steemit will hit 2 million steemit accounts a little over a year from today.  </p>
<h2 id="How&#x2019;d-you-get-there-Aggroed"><a href="#How&#x2019;d-you-get-there-Aggroed" class="headerlink" title="How&#x2019;d you get there Aggroed? "></a>How&#x2019;d you get there Aggroed? </h2><h2></h2><p>Ok, so if you look at Elyaque&#x2019;s most recent tracking post he does a nice job showing Steemians where we are at.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmU1qiRJTb1AReRkwau8NrtyxoGKAQLw8k6N2A7W6UNj9S/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s teh post I&#x2019;m taking this from:  <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@elyaque/daily-steem-report-october-25th-steem-0-95usd-2552-new-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/steemit/@elyaque/daily-steem-report-october-25th-steem-0-95usd-2552-new-accounts</a></p>
<p>Anyway, we&#x2019;re adding 2500 accounts <strong>today</strong>.  That means if we keep up that exact same pace then 1 year from now we&#x2019;ll add 912k accounts.  That will bring the total up to 1.3M as of 1 year from now.  But here&#x2019;s teh thing.  It won&#x2019;t go at that rate.  It&#x2019;ll speed up because each person will bring a buddy, and they&#x2019;ll bring a buddy, and the growth rate will look exponential.  So, there&#x2019;s the basis for my prediction.  2M accounts a little over a year from now.  Should be fun.  </p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t mean to tell you what to do&#x2026; but I&#x2019;m gonna hold onto my steem for a while still&#x2026;.  </p>
<h2 id="Risks"><a href="#Risks" class="headerlink" title="Risks "></a>Risks </h2><h2></h2><p>The major risk is this place stops working entirely.  I have faith that won&#x2019;t happen.  I think people will find some ways to make the steemit ecosystem less centralized by basically hosting more rpc nodes and more people will choose to run their own condenser.  That&#x2019;ll make this place more resiliant and a little sexier as an investment choice.</p>
<h2 id="The-upside"><a href="#The-upside" class="headerlink" title="The upside "></a>The upside </h2><h2></h2><p>We already do more transactions per second then just about any other block, and we&#x2019;re still only a year old.  We&#x2019;re efficient and we have done 19 hardforks with no side chains.  This program despite some of it&#x2019;s flaws it&#x2019;s pretty powerful.  So, I don&#x2019;t know if we&#x2019;ll follow btc up to 6k/coin, but even if we&#x2019;re at 60 a few years from now we&#x2019;ll all be sitting pretty.</p>

<h1 id="Personal-Boundaries"><a href="#Personal-Boundaries" class="headerlink" title=" Personal Boundaries "></a><center> Personal Boundaries </center></h1><p>Personal Boundaries refer to the rules and limits that we set for ourselves in regard to our relationships with others.<br>You can think of boundaries as a spectrum with <em>porous boundaries</em> on one side and <em>rigid boundaries</em> on the other.<br>Healthy boundaries fall somewhere in between these 2 extremes.</p>
<p>Healthy boundaries include being able to say &#x201C;no&#x201D; to others when you want or need to, but also being comfortable opening up to others and forming close relationships.</p>
<p>Someone with rigid boundaries keeps themselves at a distance from others  while someone with porous boundaries gets too involved with others.</p>
<p>People are multi-faceted, so someone may have porous boundaries in one area of their lives while having rigid boundaries in another.<br>Most people have different boundaries depending on the situation.</p>
<p>A healthy range for boundaries would be to set them at 20% on the low end and 80% on the high end, depending on your personality and the specific situation.</p>

<h1 id="How-To-Achieve-Healthy-Boundaries-Within-a-Community"><a href="#How-To-Achieve-Healthy-Boundaries-Within-a-Community" class="headerlink" title=" How To Achieve Healthy Boundaries Within a Community "></a><center> How To Achieve Healthy Boundaries Within a Community </center></h1><p>Healthy boundaries are essential to maintaining peace within a community or workplace.<br>Being completely porous and emotionally raw can be as problematic as being rigid and closed off from others.<br>We can create healthy boundaries by being mindful of our emotional state and setting intentions.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Mindfulness:</em></strong><br>Being mindful and aware of our emotional state is a key element for successfully working with others.<br>For example, if we are having an emotionally raw day we need to first be aware of this in order to manage it so that we don&#x2019;t explode and cause problems within the community.</p>
<p><strong><em>Setting intentions and managing your emotional state:</em></strong><br>We need to manage our emotional states to successfully work with others and maintain peace.<br>We can&#x2019;t always wear our hearts on our sleeves or be distant and unapproachable when working with others.</p>
<p>Before entering a situation, you can focus your mind to set your personal shield strength.<br>Imagine your personal walls and either build them or take them down depending on your current emotional state.<br>If you are feeling emotionally raw then build your walls to guard yourself.<br>If you are feeling overly guarded, then take down your walls in order to process the needs and concerns of others.</p>
<p>If you find that you aren&#x2019;t able to successfully manage your emotional state in this way then it is best to take a break if possible.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is not necessarily easy and it takes some work, but creating healthy boundaries is  essential in order to successfully work with other community members and to ultimately maintain peace.</p>

            <p>A few months back my oldest child was able to write a story and I ended up paying out the rewards in cash.  Tonight my youngest daughter finally gets a turn.  So, I proudly present to you my 5-year old&#x2019;s story:  The Three Little Bears</p>
<h2 id="The-Three-Little-Bears"><a href="#The-Three-Little-Bears" class="headerlink" title="The Three Little Bears "></a>The Three Little Bears </h2><h2></h2><p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmQX7kchjQxE7PRq8q2HfQ9LU3LivjtQMQEAzQrz2VVqYy/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, the littlest bear got lost in the forest.  He couldn&#x2019;t tell where his home was.  And the little bear looked and looked for his home, but he couldnt&#x2019; find it.  So, he searched in the forest and he found a candy home.  He didn&#x2019;t know what was inside.  He goed into the garden and went inside.  There was a nasty old witch named Ginger.  She looks very nice and sometimes is very nice, but at other times she is nasty.</p>

<p>The middle bear went out into the forest, but she got lost.  So, she looked and looked and found another candy house.  She looked inside, and there was a wizard.  The wizard is very nice, but the wizard is very mad.  He was mad because he couldn&#x2019;t get his potion right.  </p>

<p>The biggest bear went out in the forest and got lost.  They found another candy house.  The biggest bear went into the garden and goed in.  The bear saw a big wizard who accidentally turned himself into a mouse.  The mouse was very nice, but was actually a wizard, so, the big bear saw that the wizard&#x2019;s spell kept turning him into other animals: bears, mice, and any animal you can think of.  The wizard gave the big bear his wand, and that wand only worked with rhymes.  So, the animal wizard told the big bear what you have to do to make the wand go.<br><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmYQeQR5ESFJPF7K9QtgCw7oicdNLWm9EscEAUfbGaqrUC/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The wizard said &#x201C;diddalee do, and make this potion stop boiling in two.&#x201D;  The big bear said that and turned the wizard back into a person.  And then all of a sudden the wand made all of the bears poof back home.</p>

<p>Hey Folks, well it&#x2019;s that time for an another show promo post.  This week I got two parts of the evening lined up.</p>
<h2 id="PALnet-Orientation"><a href="#PALnet-Orientation" class="headerlink" title="PALnet Orientation "></a>PALnet Orientation </h2><h2></h2><p>So, when I first started the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord room I setup an orientation to tell people about it.  We got a few dozen people in that meeting and some of them are not only still a part of the Minnow Support Project but now active leaders and a few Steemit witnesses too.  As part of the goal of hitting 6k active members in the Discord Community I want host orientations to help folks get acquainted.  Some folks have never been in a chat room before and some folks have never been in Discord before.  It honestly can be overwhelming and I wanted to break down that barrier by personal welcoming people and giving them an orientation to our digital home. </p>
<p>Join us tonight in 3 hrs from 8-9 EST (NYC time, it&#x2019;s 5pm at the time of this post launch).  I&#x2019;ll be there to introduce you to new people.  Help you make some friends.  Find some stuff that interests you, and help you grow a community around you, which is the number 1 thing you need on the platfrom to be successful if you&#x2019;re not already rich or famous.</p>
<p>PALnet Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy</a></p>
<p>We&#x2019;ll be in general voice channel, which you can find here.  <a href="https://discord.gg/PpxP8u5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/PpxP8u5</a>  If you feel at all comfortable doing it please try to setup &#x201C;Push to Talk&#x201D; before the orientation starts.  You can find the icon for settings as the cog in the lower left right next to where you enter text, and head down to Voice, and click on the button mid screen that says &#x201C;Push to Talk.&#x201D;</p>
<p>We&#x2019;ll be in the text room at the top of the list called &#x201C;Orientation.&#x201D;  You can find the link here: <a href="https://discord.gg/EKvAjz8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/EKvAjz8</a></p>
<h2 id="Minnow-Mayor-Town-Hall"><a href="#Minnow-Mayor-Town-Hall" class="headerlink" title="Minnow Mayor Town Hall "></a>Minnow Mayor Town Hall </h2><h2></h2><p>As per the updated and now usual format I&#x2019;ll be hosting YOU on the show tonight!  You&#x2019;re welcome to come with anything you&#x2019;d like to promote.  You can ask me anything you want.  I will continue to ask that you don&#x2019;t come on air simply to attack me, but you&#x2019;re welcome to ask challenging questions and I&#x2019;ll answer them to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>If you want to go on air simply join the voice chat &#x201C;waiting room.&#x201D;  You have to have headphones, a working mic, and you have to turn the show way down or off entirely or else the feedback will wreck the interview.  I&#x2019;m going to record them and post them later.</p>
<h2 id="Delegation-250-SP"><a href="#Delegation-250-SP" class="headerlink" title="Delegation 250 SP "></a>Delegation 250 SP </h2><h2></h2><p>Anyone that comes on the air is eligible for a 250 SP delegation from me.  These delegations aren&#x2019;t normal.  They aren&#x2019;t short term leases like minnowbooster.  I plan to leave them on until you hit 5k sp and are no longer a minnow.  Then I&#x2019;ll move them along to someone else.  it make stick around for a few months, and effectively be worth $100 or so.  If you&#x2019;re a dolphin you&#x2019;re welcome to appoint someone to receive the delegation if you come on the air.  I roll for who gets it, on a roll of a one the delegation gets added to next week&#x2019;s total.</p>
<h2 id="Dice-Bitches"><a href="#Dice-Bitches" class="headerlink" title="Dice Bitches "></a>Dice Bitches </h2><h2></h2><p>We play dice during the show.  Use the <code>t!dice 15d15&apos; command</code>  If your roll ties or is higher than mine you can stick around for the next round.  The next round is 14d14 and we keep shrinking to help keep track.<br>If I win the game we start over from the begnning and everyone that was knocked out can come back and play again.<br>If I win the game two times in a row I send the 25sbd to @msp-waves to help pay the operations costs of running the station.</p>

        <div class="content">

<p>Man, I haven&#x2019;t written a STEEMIT TIPS post in a few months.  Sometimes I can&#x2019;t believe how things have progressed.  I started PALnet 4 months ago and things have changed so much since then.  Now I&#x2019;m a top 20 witness.  Now I have a new full time job.  Now I&#x2019;m hiring a team of people in a national field sales role.  I think this is getting to the point where I&#x2019;m back on an incredibly busy schedule.  It&#x2019;s starting to feel like graduate school again.  Anyway&#x2026;</p>
<p>PALnet is the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network.  It&#x2019;s a Discord community and I&#x2019;m pretty sure we started June 1st.  Ten days later I hosted an orientation to the place and a call for people to join the community.  I recorded it.  So, if you&#x2019;re interested in a little PALnet history you can view this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcsf4u8pRCo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcsf4u8pRCo</a></p>
<h2 id="Minnow-Support-Project"><a href="#Minnow-Support-Project" class="headerlink" title="Minnow Support Project "></a>Minnow Support Project </h2><h2></h2><p>The Minnow Support Project is housed within the PALnet Discord server.  MSP is a Witness run project to help Steemit grow and train and retain minnows on the platform.  About a dozen publicly elected witnesses from Steemit contribute to or help run the Minnow Support Project.  You can find some details about us on the minnowsupportproject.org website or on the @minnowsupport wall.</p>
<p>One of the things I quickly realized about Steemit is that it&#x2019;s not just what you write, but who you know and who supports you.  This place is as much about you as a person as it is about you as a writer.  So, if you want to be successful you need a community around you.  Minnows don&#x2019;t have a lot of power, influence, or know how about the platform when they first start, so I wanted to create something that you could hop into and join to learn some of that and then put it to good use as a community.</p>
<h2 id="Discord"><a href="#Discord" class="headerlink" title="Discord "></a>Discord </h2><h2></h2><p>Since I made PALnet I&#x2019;ve been sucked into Discord.  Discord isn&#x2019;t just a chatroom.  It&#x2019;s a community.  It&#x2019;s an extremely powerful community.  Steemit is many things and many of them are amazing, but it&#x2019;s not really a community.  Yeah, we&#x2019;re all interacting on the block, but at best it&#x2019;s like being pen pals with someone.  Discord is an internet worth of people available immediately 24/7 always ready to chat, <em>hug</em>, laugh, sing, talk, or build something together.  You log in and you see friends.  You can talk about your problems.  I see rough stories of sexual abuse, physical abuse, marriage difficulty, heart ache, and financial problems.  I also see uplifting stories of raises, new jobs, new friendships, and often times just people playing together.</p>
<p>What amazes me is that people will come in there and some just take one look and run screaming for the hills.  But literally thousands of people come through there every month and share stories, friendship, and we&#x2019;re building something together.  </p>
<h2 id="It&#x2019;s-pretty-big"><a href="#It&#x2019;s-pretty-big" class="headerlink" title="It&#x2019;s pretty big "></a>It&#x2019;s pretty big </h2><h2></h2><p>PALnet has just shy of 5,000 active members.  These are people that have checked in within the last month and actually commented or interacted in our channel.  WE BUILT SOMETHING FOR 5000 PEOPLE IN 4 MONTHS!!!  That&#x2019;s staggering to me.  Especially since we basically started with nothing but &#x201C;Hey I should put this resteem contest on it&#x2019;s own page&#x201D; and &#x201C;I think it would be nice to have a place for folks to gather that like these values!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now we have 5,000 active people.  A team of incredibly dedicated moderators to help things get going.  Almost 600 delegations with a total nearing 200k SP.  We have a streaming radio station.  We have an RPC node.  We&#x2019;ve spun off a few successful new Discord rooms of our own.  We have 3 of the top 20 witnesses who didn&#x2019;t get there until after they started working with the Minnow Support Project and we have several folks between 70-21 that are steadily growing their influence and stake weight on the platform.</p>
<p>All things considered.  It&#x2019;s pretty amazing.  So, I&#x2019;m done right?  NOPE!</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s the thing.  The world isn&#x2019;t fixed yet.  The world is still largely at war.  Most people are still impoverished.  And the Orwellian spynet is bigger than ever with robotic enforcers coming.  To that I say &#x201C;Oh, hell no!&#x201D;  But 5,000 people isn&#x2019;t enough to overturn the current world order.  We&#x2019;re gonna need more.  </p>
<h2 id="SIX-THOUSAND"><a href="#SIX-THOUSAND" class="headerlink" title="SIX THOUSAND "></a>SIX THOUSAND </h2><h2></h2><p>So, my next goal is 6,000 active people.  That&#x2019;s 20% growth.  I want to do it by the end of December.  Rather than pawning this responsibility on anyone else.  I&#x2019;m gonna lead by example.  I&#x2019;m going to actively recruit more people and help grow the Discord channel.  To facilitate this I&#x2019;m going to host an orientation for PALnet tomorrow night before my radio show.  My show is at 9pm EST (NYC time).  So, I&#x2019;m going to show up early at 8pm.  I&#x2019;m going to sit in a voice channel and welcome people, answer questions, and show folks around.</p>
<p>You get to learn about our people, our roles, our bots, our values, our process, and why it&#x2019;s a really great place to hang out.  I&#x2019;ll show you the ropes.   It doesn&#x2019;t cost anything.  I&#x2019;m not asking for anything.  I&#x2019;m just hoping that once you see what we&#x2019;re like you&#x2019;ll choose to spend time with us too.</p>
<p>So, here&#x2019;s the link to PALnet Discord Server: <a href="https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy</a>.  There are usually some 400-500 people online at any given moment, but I&#x2019;m promising to be one of them at 8pm tomorrow night to welcome you to our community.  I hope to see you there.</p>
