The two party system is inherently rigged, and it&#x2019;s internally rigged.</strong></p><br><p><img src="https://s15.postimg.org/l1c4wz4or/Two_headedsnake.jpg" width="600" height="300"></p><br><p>I don&#x2019;t have great links for this. &#xA0;The gist is that on the one hand you have a party that enables the Federal Reserve, promotes infinite wars, allows abortions, encourages the welfare state, and promotes environmental regulations and on the other side you have a party that enables the Federal Reserve, promotes infinite wars, opposes abortions, and wants to build a wall. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s a fake choice because you&#x2019;re picking flavors of violence and control and not given the option to act freely and independently. &#xA0;</p><br><p>It&#x2019;s worse now then it has ever been in part because of citizens united. &#xA0;That was a supreme court decision that said money=free speech so companies and people can donate as much as they wanted into a political campaign. &#xA0;Now people politicians are basically for sale.</p><br><p>What&#x2019;s worse is the structure within the system. &#xA0;Not only is the outright bribing of politicians now an every day fact, but in the off chance an actual honest human being gets into power they quickly find out that most officials have no real power as it rests almost exclusively in the majority leaders. &#xA0;That means only one party is in charge of a branch of government, and only the senior leaders have any real say. &#xA0;You want actual reforms to get through? &#xA0;Fat chance.</p><br><p>Lastly, to make sure you can&#x2019;t get anywhere near elected there&#x2019;s the electoral college system and superdelegate system. &#xA0;These completely undemocratic systems mean you actually vote not for the candidate but for someone to cast an actual vote for your candidate, and that person doesn&#x2019;t even have to vote for who they were supposed to vote for. &#xA0;If that sounds convoluted it is, and it&#x2019;s evidence of a completely broken system. &#xA0;Just ask any Sanders supports that.&#xA0;</p><br><p><br></p><br><p><strong>5. &#xA0;The Vatican lays claim to just about everything</strong></p><br><p><img src="https://vaticanvisitor.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/canonize-3_wide-55388b3d0f03e7390cee6fb830bdf978d25c606e.jpg" width="5760" height="3235"></p><br><p>The Vatican claims to own your property, your soul, and anything you create. &#xA0;These are statements issued in Papal Bulls dating back 500+ years. &#xA0;At the end of the long chain of abuses experienced directly or indirectly by just about every person on the planet there seems to be evidence that it all comes down the Vatican. &#xA0;Here&#x2019;s a recent <a href="http://www.theeventchronicle.com/study/critical-knowledge-legal-ownership-souls-vatican-since-1306/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study </a>put out by <a href="http://stopthepirates.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stop the Pirates</a>, which appears to be a fantastic research group of folks going down the Rabbit Hole to find out where all the systematic fraud originates and how to undo it.</p><br><p><br></p><br><p>There is a lot more to all of this, but if you need some good starting points. &#xA0;You couldn&#x2019;t ask for a better place then what&#x2019;s included here. &#xA0;That ought to take you at least a year to fully internalize what the world actually looks like.</p><br><p>Also, I don&#x2019;t mean to suggest that everyone in government is a bad person, that every catholic is a bad person, every repub/democrat is a bad person. &#xA0;I think that almost everyone on this planet means pretty well, but it&#x2019;s hard to do good deeds when we are all purposefully kept broke and tired. &#xA0;So, don&#x2019;t think I hate or have given up on humanity or people. &#xA0;We&#x2019;re pretty awesome. &#xA0;We just need to get rid of some very seriously bad actors.</p><br>
