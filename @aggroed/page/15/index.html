<p>I think Steem is in a funky place.  We&#x2019;re more volatile than many of the other crypto coins because we have SBD.  By having SBD we have something stable-ish, but by virtue of making that one stable we have Steem, which becomes much less stable.  On top of that people think of this as a token they earn.  And you typcially try to spend the thing that you earn.  We don&#x2019;t really have a mindset here of investing just yet&#x2026; that&#x2019;ll come and I hope that Steem-Engine, tokens, and business help with that.  People come here to work, and they spend what they earn.  It puts downward pressure on the price of Steem that many come here to earn and spend.  In the end it&#x2019;ll be healthy, but it makes for some wild price swings.</p>
<h2 id="Steem-is-Dead"><a href="#Steem-is-Dead" class="headerlink" title="Steem is Dead"></a>Steem is Dead</h2><p>I&#x2019;ve heard this before.  I don&#x2019;t believe it.  I believe the opposite.  Steem is in a great position to thrive.  I know more tools and games are on the way.  It&#x2019;s easy to build to build here.  There&#x2019;s lots of devs with the skills to build here.  There&#x2019;s a community.  Others will tell you that their tech is better.  others will tell you that their apps can do more.  Those things might be true, but then I ask &#x201C;how can you plug me into the community&#x201D; and i get blank stares&#x2026; &#x201C;Well, we have a telegram group with 40,000 acounts and zero activity&#x2026;&#x201D;  Yeah, that doesn&#x2019;t quite cut it for me.</p>
<p>People said Steem was dead.  The altcoins were all gonna die.  Death was imminent.  It&#x2019;s still here.  It looks like it&#x2019;s on rebound like crazy too.</p>
<h2 id="CMC"><a href="#CMC" class="headerlink" title="CMC"></a>CMC</h2><p>CMC and marketcap might not be the best way to track stuff, but it&#x2019;s one way to do it.  Steem has been under 50th recently.  That&#x2019;s bad.  You can see it&#x2019;s sitting at 36 now.  That&#x2019;s not great, but I got a feeling we have a little pause in price before the buying starts again.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/aggroed/Bl2AIAHh-image.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<h2 id="The-charts"><a href="#The-charts" class="headerlink" title="The charts"></a>The charts</h2><p><img src="https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/aggroed/OR8nzHZk-image.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>That&#x2019;s a chart of the price of Steem in USD.  The yellow line is the 200 day moving average.  You can see that steem is right up against it.  It&#x2019;s forming some resistance right there.  You can see the shorter term moving averages turning back up.  When I&#x2019;m looking at this thing I think we&#x2019;re gonna have a few days or weeks where the moving average prices are able to catch up, and then Steem is gonna shoot past the 200 day moving average.  The last time Steem went above the moving average we went from 20 cents to 9 dollars.  We&#x2019;ll see where it goes this time&#x2026;  </p>
<p>Next big resistance line is around 76 cents.  Here&#x2019;s hoping we can reach it before the end of March.  Trading is hard otherwise everyone could make a fortune.  I&#x2019;m not an expert or really all that good.  So, I just HODL steem and build here.  You gotta figure out what&#x2019;s right for your family because I don&#x2019;t know, but I&#x2019;m looking forward to Steem doing well again!</p>
<h2 id="Monsters"><a href="#Monsters" class="headerlink" title="Monsters"></a>Monsters</h2><p>Since Steem might pause here for a couple weeks consider taking some profits off the table through purchasing cards on the Monster Market through Steem Monsters or Peakmonsters.  We&#x2019;re launching delegation soon where you&#x2019;ll be able to rent cards.  So, even if you don&#x2019;t want to play you could snag some big cards to rent.  Steem has a great chance to grow, and in order to grow significantly we&#x2019;ll likely need to grow by tens of thousands of users.  Monsters has to grow the player base too, but if we just get 1-2k more people it&#x2019;ll have a drastic effect on card prices.  So, our goal post feels lower to me, which is why I keep buying, hodling, and soon I&#x2019;ll be renting!</p>
<p>Disclaimer: informational and entertainment purposes only.  Not a financial expert I don&#x2019;t know your situation and I&#x2019;m not in a place to tell you whether or a good or exceptional idea to sell your house and hodl monsters.  Do your own due diligence.</p>

<p>Look at that chart.  The lowest point is right when automated tournaments hit the test server.  Cards have gained $80k+ USD in value since then in under two weeks.</p>
<p>Now we&#x2019;re seeing Steem touching 50 cents.  That&#x2019;s a long way from $10 highs, but sure beats the recent lows.</p>
<p>I think both of those are bullish for Monsters!  I&#x2019;m especially proud to see us turning around before Bitcoin.  That to me says wonderful things about our game, market, and community!  This is the longest bear market in the history of bitcoin, and we&#x2019;re pulling out ahead of schedule.  WOOT!</p>
<p><em>If this is what we&#x2019;re doing in a bear market what do you think will happen when the bulls come back?</em></p>
<h2 id="Tournament-Payout"><a href="#Tournament-Payout" class="headerlink" title="Tournament Payout"></a>Tournament Payout</h2><p>I think the reason has a lot to do with this!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdiDP3wa5r4SMrWdoDHsuPM1iTvygxbjtmQi2rEw67Ybs/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It&#x2019;s been under 2 weeks and we&#x2019;re at $3800 paid out.  There&#x2019;s something magical about letting any player in a decentralized manner earn just through Playing Steem Monsters!  With tournament sponsors joining the mix we&#x2019;re seeing more prize pools!</p>
<h2 id="Dive-into-Steem-Monsters"><a href="#Dive-into-Steem-Monsters" class="headerlink" title="Dive into Steem Monsters!"></a>Dive into Steem Monsters!</h2><p>With delegation coming soon it&#x2019;ll be easier than ever to earn while playing than ever before.  It&#x2019;s already live on the test server.  The full feature and markets around it will be here soon.  New players will have a much smaller barrier to entry to get started and hodlers will have a chance to passively earn while hodling and delegating cards!</p>
<p>I can&#x2019;t tell you what&#x2019;s best for you because I don&#x2019;t know your financial situation, but I&#x2019;m stoked for the future!</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re not playing now&#x2019;s the time to get in the game before market prices get out of reach.  If you are playing considering picking up a team for friends to play.  In the future they may be your guild mate!</p>
<p>I can&#x2019;t wait to see where it goes and I hope you&#x2019;re on the Steem Monsters Moon Ship with me!</p>

<p>Here&#x2019;s a video interview I did with @crypt0.  Omar is great and has been telling great stories and sharing blockchain happenings for a while.</p>
<p>I looked at this earlier and saw 700 views.  It&#x2019;s down to 600 now&#x2026;  It&#x2019;s got 93 likes.  You&#x2019;re telling me 1 in 6 is clicking like.  There&#x2019;s so much fuckery, and the normies think the view count is legit.</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t know the end game here, but I&#x2019;ve been suppressed on social media since 2012.  Steem is the one place that doesn&#x2019;t happen (unless you piss off Bernie or FTG).  Even when flagged though everything stays on chain!  At some point enough people will realize if it&#x2019;s not on a blockchain it&#x2019;s gonna get nuked.</p>

<p>Hey, fun fact.  I&#x2019;m still making tournaments manually.  When I do it I make them two weeks in advance of when they are going to happen.  Overall we&#x2019;re in a bear market still, but Steem seems to be heading out of it.</p>
<h2 id="Steem-Chart"><a href="#Steem-Chart" class="headerlink" title="Steem Chart"></a>Steem Chart</h2><p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmTDNRn7aHchatcFcggcRzxXxQrovEycyd4pVg1C5a7dsV/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There really isn&#x2019;t that much resistance between here and the 90 cent range.  We&#x2019;ll see if we can make it up there!  But for now it looks like Steem is set to go on a nice bull run for the next couple of weeks.  I don&#x2019;t have a crystal ball and can&#x2019;t tell for sure, but that looks like a good chart to me!</p>
<h2 id="Monster-Tournaments"><a href="#Monster-Tournaments" class="headerlink" title="Monster Tournaments"></a>Monster Tournaments</h2><p>Anyway, what this is doing is inflating how much money is being paid out in tournaments for Steem Monsters.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmcw1iAUZZB4f5p461PDX2TR9mbx6FLBfZKamwzfNgBGzE/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There&#x2019;s less than two weeks of tournaments planned and there&#x2019;s $5400 to earn.  If prices keep rising that&#x2019;s gonna be a lot of money very quickly!</p>
<h2 id="Marketcap"><a href="#Marketcap" class="headerlink" title="Marketcap"></a>Marketcap</h2><p>There&#x2019;s a bot in Discord that runs a marketcap command.  It tallies prices.  There&#x2019;s some argument around how perfect the number is, but it provides a steady means to evaluate how the cards are doing.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUZvQW8uDMaQyQLzTVwW7abtVUwS7gvyeRyBQas3JaDz7/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We&#x2019;ve completely turned around prices, gone up $60,0000+ in under two weeks and it&#x2019;s all been since the launch of tournaments!</p>
<p>Tournaments are going, monster prices are up, and now Steem Prices are spiking.  What do you think will happen to the value of cards?</p>
<p>Combine that with some cool new features like card rentals, and a whole new in game currency that you earn by winning matches that we&#x2019;re rolling out and then consider how we&#x2019;re working to bridge other communities/blockchains to come play Steem Monsters and you&#x2019;ll get why Matt and I are feeling rather bullish!</p>
<h2 id="Figure-out-what&#x2019;s-right-for-you"><a href="#Figure-out-what&#x2019;s-right-for-you" class="headerlink" title="Figure out what&#x2019;s right for you"></a>Figure out what&#x2019;s right for you</h2><p>I can&#x2019;t tell you what&#x2019;s right for your family.  Maybe working forever in you corporate job is the thing that&#x2019;s best for you.  Maybe you should SODL your house and HODL monsters.  IDK, I can&#x2019;t tell you what the right plan is for your family.  All I can do is entertain and inform your of some cool stats that are out there.  Hopefully you&#x2019;ll figure out what you&#x2019;ve been hearing for months: Steem Monsters is cool and is a neat way to stake some crypto.</p>
<p>Now excuse me, I have to get my space suit and moon boots laundered for I what hope is coming soon.</p>
<p>Oh, and don&#x2019;t even get me started about what happens in May when the next BTC halving is under 1 year away&#x2026;</p>

<p>The Steem Engine team (@harpagon, @yabapmatt, @aggroed) are thrilled to report that the Decentralized Exchange is now open for business! Check out <a href="https://steem-engine.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steem-engine.com</a> NOW!</p>
<p><strong>Special thanks go to @asgarth for building the market UI on the website!!!</strong></p>
<h2 id="What-is-a-decentralized-exchange"><a href="#What-is-a-decentralized-exchange" class="headerlink" title="What is a decentralized exchange?"></a>What is a decentralized exchange?</h2><p>A Decentralized EXchange (DEX) is an exchange that allows users to buy and sell different tokens on an open market without a central authority. You may already be familiar with some decentralized exchanges such as BitShares, Stellar, and even the internal STEEM/SBD market. On Steem Engine, the DEX facilitates trades between any of the tokens that have been created on the Steem Engine platform and the STEEM token.</p>
<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-the-benefit"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-the-benefit" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s the benefit?"></a>What&#x2019;s the benefit?</h2><p>Instant liquidity!  Anyone who creates a token on the Steem Engine platform is immediately able to have those tokens available for trading against STEEM.  You don&#x2019;t have to beg an exchange or pay a listing fee.  They just get listed automatically!  </p>
<p><strong>This means that it&#x2019;s easier than ever to tokenize your project and sell your token for crypto with established value!</strong></p>
<h2 id="How-does-it-work"><a href="#How-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="How does it work?"></a>How does it work?</h2><p>Since Steem Engine is not a part of the core Steem blockchain code, it cannot trade the STEEM token directly. Instead all Steem Engine tokens will be traded against a token that is pegged to STEEM called STEEMP.</p>
<p>You can convert your STEEM to STEEMP by transferring STEEM to the @steem-peg account with a specific memo, and then you can use it to trade for other Steem Engine tokens on the market. Similarly, you can at any time withdraw your STEEMP back to STEEM by publishing the appropriate transaction to the Steem blockchain. There are simple Deposit and Withdraw options on the <a href="https://steem-engine.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steem Engine Website</a> which will allow you do this easily.</p>
<p>Unlike pegged coins like Tether, you can always easily verify that enough STEEM is held in the @steem-peg account to back all of the STEEMP tokens issued on Steem Engine. This is exactly the same as how the Steem Anchor project works to list STEEM and SBD on the Stellar exchange, for example.</p>
<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-the-cost"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-the-cost" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s the cost?"></a>What&#x2019;s the cost?</h2><p>All trades on the Steem Engine DEX are free, with no fees of any kind, although you will need to have enough Resource Credits available in your Steem account to publish the transaction.</p>
<p>Separately, there will be a 1% fee on all STEEM deposits and withdrawals for the service of providing a bridge between STEEM and STEEMP. This fee, in addition to selling ENG to create new tokens, will be used to fund the ongoing development of the platform.</p>
<h2 id="How-do-I-use-the-DEX"><a href="#How-do-I-use-the-DEX" class="headerlink" title="How do I use the DEX?"></a>How do I use the DEX?</h2><p>Go to <a href="https://steem-engine.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steem-engine.com</a> and click on <code>Market</code>. The top tokens in volume will be shown on the left and you can click on the one you are interested in trading. Additionally, on the wallet or token list view there is a trade icon that you can click on to go directly to the market view for that token.</p>
<p>Once on the market view for the specific token you wish to trade, you can see bid/ask information, recent trades, a depth chart, and enter your own buy or sell transactions to trade that token against STEEM.</p>
<h2 id="Additional-Updates"><a href="#Additional-Updates" class="headerlink" title="Additional Updates"></a>Additional Updates</h2><p>We have also added a &#x201C;metadata&#x201D; property to each token on the platform which will allow the token creator to associate arbitrary data with their token in JSON format. This is very similar to the &#x201C;json_metadata&#x201D; property currently available on Steem accounts.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;url&#x201D; property, which was previously at the top level, has now been moved into the &#x201C;metadata&#x201D;, and the Steem Engine website will also check for the &#x201C;icon&#x201D; property for a URL of an icon image to display alongside each token (64x64 recommended size, minimum 24x24, SVG file type recommended), and a &#x201C;desc&#x201D; property for a short description of each token.</p>
<p>To update the metadata for a token through the website, you must be logged in as the account that created the token and then you should see an edit button at the bottom of the token info popup.</p>
<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-the-best-way-to-log-in"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-the-best-way-to-log-in" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s the best way to log in?"></a>What&#x2019;s the best way to log in?</h2><p>We suggest logging in with the Steem Keychain browser extension.  Keychain is a free and open source browser extension designed by @yabapmatt and @aggroed and programmed by the man who made Steem-Plus, @stoodkev.  You can easily and securely manage multiple Steem accounts and never have to worry about copying and pasting your keys again. Keychain is integrated with an ever growing number of Steem-based websites and dapps that you will be able to use with just a click of a button!

            <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uyUGKeo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I&#x2019;m happy to let you know that since tournaments have formed that Players have been awarded $3000 in cards and crypto through the <a href="https://steemit.com/steemmonsters/@steemmonsters/first-automated-tournament-on-steemmonsters-com-300-steem-prize" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automated tournament system</a>.  THAT WAS 8 DAYS AGO!!! </p>
<p><em>Are you playing?  Do you even Steem Monsters brah?  Is it fun to watch others earn while playing a game while you&#x2019;re sitting on the sideline?</em></p>
<p>We built this game with the idea that not everyone could earn through blogging.  We wanted a game that would invite the world into the rewards that crypto can provide.  So, now you can play a game, earn crypto, hodl tokens, trade them, and sell them when you&#x2019;re done.</p>
<p><strong><a href="steemmonsters.com">You should play!</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="Marketcap"><a href="#Marketcap" class="headerlink" title="Marketcap"></a>Marketcap</h2><p>One way to track how the game is progressing is by watching the marketcap.  We got hurt just like everyone else in the crypto market.  Bitcoin lost 85%+ of it&#x2019;s value.  Steem went from $10 to 26 cents.  </p>
<p>Everyone got rekt.  All tokens lost value and SM was no exception.  And it hurt.  That said, since we launched tournaments we&#x2019;ve been able to do something awesome.  We strongly reversed a trend in the middle of the longest bear market in the history of bitcoin.  What do you think will happen to Steem Monsters in a bull run?</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Bqr5GTQ.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We have a bot in the Steem Monsters Discord Server that calculates Marketcap.  The bot isn&#x2019;t perfect, but we can track the same number over time and it gives us some sense of the value of the cards.  You can see as the market crashed Steem Monsters was hurt, but you can in the last week or so that Steem Monsters has regained $55-60k in value.  </p>
<p><strong>Tournaments have been live on the main site for 1 WEEK and we&#x2019;re up $60k what do you think will happen when it&#x2019;s been a year?</strong></p>
<h2 id="What-the-future-holds"><a href="#What-the-future-holds" class="headerlink" title="What the future holds"></a>What the future holds</h2><p>My crystal ball doesn&#x2019;t work, and I don&#x2019;t know where prices will be tomorrow or a year from now, but when I look at that chart and know what&#x2019;s coming I get excited.  </p>
<p>Delegation, the ability to trustlessly rent cards to other players, will open up the game to new players at a very affordable price and Hodlers will have a chance to earn a passive income.  We were worried nearly a year ago when we opened up gifting as an option as it made it so that players could work with eachother rather than buy cards directly from Steem Monsters.  BUT, because there&#x2019;s more economic freedom it&#x2019;s easier to make a purchase because you know there&#x2019;s more liquidity for the card.  I think gifting and trading accelerated sales.  I predict the same thing here.  </p>
<p>While it&#x2019;s possible that delegation could hurt sales temporarily that&#x2019;s not what I envision happening.  I see a world where new players come in by renting whole pre-built decks on alt accounts without the threat of theft to the owner, I see card hodlers with little time purchasing cards with the intent to rent them out, and I see players with little money able to play at higher levels and enjoy the game more than ever before.  <em>How do you think this will impact the game?</em></p>
<p>Next up is Dark Energy Crystals; an in game currency.  Having an in game currency that can be traded on a DEX available to everyone on Steem, tying it to new products like skins, in game boosts, and votes from the @steemmonsters account will drive engagement.  You&#x2019;ll literally get paid for your wins!  Trade that token for in game goods, cards from peers, votes from Steem Monsters, and new expasion stuff we&#x2019;ll launch on the site after DEC exists.</p>
<p>One key feature of the expansion is that players can melt cards down to get DEC.  <em>What do you think will happen to supply of cards if suddenly everyone can take cards they no longer want and turn them into DEC to spend on other stuff?  What do you think will happen to the price of cards?</em></p>
<h2 id="The-time-is-now"><a href="#The-time-is-now" class="headerlink" title="The time is now"></a>The time is now</h2><p>I can&#x2019;t tell you what&#x2019;s right for your family, finances, or friends, but I know what&#x2019;s right for me.  I&#x2019;m already the largst hodler of Steem Monsters cards and I&#x2019;m simply here to inform you I keep buying them.  I buy the golds to win the big tournaments, I buy summoners which everyone needs to rent out later, and with DEC even closer I&#x2019;m buying the cheapest cards out there with a plan to melt&#x2019;m down and get other stuff.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re on a break from Steem Monsters I&#x2019;d encourage you to come back!  If you&#x2019;re already playing consider pushing up a tier.  If you&#x2019;re brand new to the game consider dipping your toe in.</p>
<p>The trend is your friend and this trend looks great!  </p>
<p><em>I hope this post was informative and enjoyable as that was the sole intention!</em></p>
