<p>When I first got here I quickly became aware of @berniesanders.  The election was in full swing, the politician was a well known fellow, and here&#x2019;s this super strong presence with his fingers all over the blockchain.  It didn&#x2019;t take long for me to realize that many people here found him to be rude, obnoxious, an egomaniac, and completely out of line.  He himself says he&#x2019;s a Dedicated Asshole.</p>

<h2 id="The-evidence-against-him"><a href="#The-evidence-against-him" class="headerlink" title="The evidence against him "></a>The evidence against him </h2><h2></h2><p>Here&#x2019;s a gem of a conversation with @stellebella where he flat out calls her a cunt and to get off the platform.  (I&#x2019;m having a hard time finding the original conversation so I&#x2019;m posting these as a place holder, also please note @berniesanders has many alts on here.  @nextgencrypto is one of them.).</p>

<p>Oh, and don&#x2019;t think anyone is immune.  You may have missed this conversation where he takes @ned to task very publicly in the #price channel in Steemit chat.  (@ned follows this blog!  Hi Ned!)</p>

<p>He&#x2019;s an unofficial leader in hating on this platform.  He uses the abbreviation STINC for Steemit Inc. I&#x2019;ve heard that sentiment mimicked from many other witnesses in the witness channel.  It seems they are frustrated by the lack of GUI improvements on the site, the general performance of the site, and the lack of sales and marketing efforts and people employed by STEEMIT.</p>
<h2 id="I-got-Flagged"><a href="#I-got-Flagged" class="headerlink" title="I got Flagged "></a>I got Flagged </h2><h2></h2><p>I wrote a post about my own personal experience  to the first time I caught a Bernie flag.  </p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/notquitesatire/@aggroed/my-award-speech-to-the-berniesanders-responsible-flag-foundation-benefit-awards-dinner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/notquitesatire/@aggroed/my-award-speech-to-the-berniesanders-responsible-flag-foundation-benefit-awards-dinner</a></p>
<p>I caught mine when I tried to bridge the peace between @gavvet and @berniesanders.  @gavvet had a measured response.  @berniesanders roughly told me to go fuck myself and @gavvet could too!</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmeidHkaBfZFFP6uvAooeqFMfk7VTtso9H2fkZ4kvuKQe1/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Basically it sucked.  It hurt my pride.  It hurt my wallet.  I was mad.  But he also had a point and on that day he flagged everyone!  It wasn&#x2019;t personal.   </p>
<h2 id="Achievement-unlocked"><a href="#Achievement-unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Achievement unlocked "></a>Achievement unlocked </h2><h2></h2><p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmTHVcMGQmT9rgmuoRNTZ4En1h5jHLxXzN8qZW5P3N8RAM/bernieflag1.png" alt="bernieflag1.png"><br><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmWGc5TJB8giTS47dSjVkofZwgbhp6r2NDSMA3DbWmxkUi/bernieflag2.png" alt="bernieflag2.png"></p>
<h2 id="First-Conclusion"><a href="#First-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="First Conclusion "></a>First Conclusion </h2><h2></h2><p>So, with these kinda fingerprints on the blockchain it looks like he&#x2019;s a complete fucking asshole and not just a Dedicated one.  If you believe that I can understand that.  I thought so too.</p>
<h2 id="But-then-there&#x2019;s-this"><a href="#But-then-there&#x2019;s-this" class="headerlink" title="But then there&#x2019;s this.  "></a>But then there&#x2019;s this.  </h2><h2></h2><p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmZ4x4ZE31wp5smBg9smcipcT7MtMGgfpDNf7sFgraBPMJ/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Apparently he&#x2019;s the world&#x2019;s biggest STEEMIT hating asshole that&#x2019;s also willing to donate SBDs to a 15 year old kid to help him go to STEAMFEST.  Well, that was probably a fluke right?  Here&#x2019;s the full context- <a href="https://steemit.com/steemfest/@aggroed/the-autobots-just-collectively-donated-usd333-sbds-to-the-travel-fund-but-theprophet0-still-needs-more-to-get-to-steemfest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/steemfest/@aggroed/the-autobots-just-collectively-donated-usd333-sbds-to-the-travel-fund-but-theprophet0-still-needs-more-to-get-to-steemfest</a></p>
<p>Well, you know who is the biggest donor behind the curation trails?  You know Engagement?  Guess what!?!  That&#x2019;s @berniesanders.  All those votes that you&#x2019;ve gotten with $5-10 at a time came from the world&#x2019;s biggest asshole&#x2026;</p>
<p>Lastly, have you had fun with @randowhale yet?  Steemit&#x2019;s cute little &#x201C;Whale of Fortune.&#x201D;  Can you see where I&#x201D;m going here?!?  It&#x2019;s Bernie&#x2019;s!  He&#x2019;s tossing out whale votes for your fun, for BTS spite, and for the lulz.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmfSK1CfhJgyoyaxEAp8XLFWbeY9Hsk3AavzUYFRoSv2RT/image.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="You&#x2019;ve-got-Flag"><a href="#You&#x2019;ve-got-Flag" class="headerlink" title="You&#x2019;ve got Flag "></a>You&#x2019;ve got Flag </h2><h2></h2><p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmbSrYjSwMGMJE31NThQReD6sATRtbeZMKLBrbkSn66EAX/You&apos;ve%20got%20flag.png" alt="You&apos;ve got flag.png"></p>
<p>So, that brings me to general flagging.  You probably know he&#x2019;s the most flagrant flagger in Steemit (though Abit might be in for a tie there).  You guys might think &#x201C;WTF are these asshole whales doing running around flagging all this shit brat?&#x201D;  Well,here&#x2019;s the 411 on that.  </p>
<p>Whales that up vote themselves, up vote their alts, and circle jerk their friends hurt the reward pool for the rest of us.  These two self appointed police decided against rewardpoolrape and decided to protect us all from it.  So, in part because whale curation and voting is so broken right now they decided that HF 18 needed some serious policing, looked around, saw no one and no leadership, but decided that they had enough power and clout to weather it. </p>
<p>I think he honestly just lost his cool and rampaged on this post.<br><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmUzxPs3uWmD2pCDHTEvkQJKWvC4Q5wArmkV8S5bkQWHrZ/image.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Where&#x2019;d-I-land"><a href="#Where&#x2019;d-I-land" class="headerlink" title="Where&#x2019;d I land? "></a>Where&#x2019;d I land? </h2><h2></h2><p>The world&#x2019;s biggest flagging Dedicated Asshole is helping kids, curating the shit out of this place, and protecting us all from whales gaming the system.  He&#x2019;s holding Steemit to task for site slowness and lack of progress on a modern and easy to use GUI.  And he&#x2019;s curating all your minnow posts so you have a chance to grow around here.  </p>
<p>I think some people come to the conclusion that he doesn&#x2019;t give a fuck about anyone or anything&#x2026; I have the opposite opinion.  I think he&#x2019;s incredibly passionate about this place and holds it to ridiculously high standards and then rages when humanity fails him.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s a thankless job, and this post is to say thanks. These guys deserve a medal, but all I can do is give him a badge made by @elyaque to hopefully keep him in the Steemit history books.</p>
<h2 id="PS"><a href="#PS" class="headerlink" title="PS "></a>PS </h2><h2></h2><p>All that said.  I&#x2019;m pretty sure he&#x2019;s an asshole, but don&#x2019;t tell him I said that because he upvoted my Witness yesterday.  I fuckin&#x2019; love this place!</p>

<h2 id="The-Number-one-challenge-on-Steemit"><a href="#The-Number-one-challenge-on-Steemit" class="headerlink" title="The Number one challenge on Steemit "></a>The Number one challenge on Steemit </h2><h2></h2><p>93.33% of the steem rests in the hands of the 1% of steem owners.  That&#x2019;s not even including the STEEMIT INC account.  My number one frustration on the platform is the distribution, and I spend a lot of my new commute time trying to figure out what we can do about it.</p>
<p>The good news to many is that the price of steem is going up, but the bad news is that this will hurt distribution.  While the actual percentages won&#x2019;t change with a price increase the amount of fiat required to purchase their share goes up.  So, judging by the cost in fiat dollars it gets harder and harder to solve the distribution crisis as Steem mainstreams and price goes up.</p>
<p>It leads to problems on the server.  You probably have heard the term circle-jerk in regards to the trending section.  It&#x2019;s the reality that many weak posts by well known authors are able to catch huge rewards.  A single image or a single video may catch $500 or more.  It&#x2019;s so frustrating to see as a minnow or dolphin pouring your life into a 2 hour post that gets 8 views and 3 cents.</p>
<p>As my wife put it-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My $0.02 cents are only worth 1 cent. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason behind supported shit posts are several.  The rewards are high so there&#x2019;s lots of incentive as an author.  The consequences are low unless the Uber whales collectively decide to punish people.  There are social reasons&#x2026; &#x201C;You scratch my shitpost and I&#x2019;ll scratch yours,&#x201D; or &#x201C;what&#x2019;s the big deal that author&#x2019;s my friend.&#x201D;  But the biggest reason is that curation favors it.</p>
<p>If I&#x2019;m a whale I can make $1k/week upvoting comments.  I make more when I upvote successful posts early.  The already well known authors with high reps, big followings, and proven success getting big rewards is my highest chance for a fat payday on my upvote.  You can&#x2019;t blame them.  If I could make $1k a week just by upvoting my buddies who were doing the same to me I&#x2019;d be hard pressed to do anything different.  So, curation starts looking like kids playing soccer where everyone is grouping up around the same ball.</p>

<h2 id="What-are-some-potential-solutions"><a href="#What-are-some-potential-solutions" class="headerlink" title="What are some potential solutions? "></a>What are some potential solutions? </h2><h2></h2><p>So, short of a cultural revolution we gotta figure something out to help change the distribution over time.  My first suggestion is to alter the reward curve for whale curation so that it&#x2019;s at least partially dependent on the delta between their own steem power and the steem power of the post they are voting on.  </p>
<p>For example; I&#x2019;d like the future to look more like this-  Whales get higher percentage rewards for finding a good minnow post, up voting it, resteeming, and possibly seeing the same circle jerk effect, but at least it&#x2019;s on minnow posts.  They can still be rewarded for posting on their friends posts but the percentage or cap is less attractive.  That&#x2019;s one approach.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to reduce the voting power used when it&#x2019;s spent on a weaker account.  In this case the whale could presumably have more votes that pay somewhat less individually (because there&#x2019;s less of a chance of a pile onto the post) but with the right curve or power that could still be better than just the ganging up on another whales post because they can only vote on fewer of them.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s possible these comments are moot after HF 19 and linear rewards, but I&#x2019;m pretty nervous that it&#x2019;ll go on.  They&#x2019;ll just have fewer more powerful votes to send their buddies to the moon!</p>
<center> <img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/ToMjGpjwk1MxyYRcQnK/giphy.gif" alt=""> </center>



<p>If we can incentivize the whales to look for minnow posts, up vote them, and resteem them we have a better shot of helping minnows and dolphins grow their accounts.  I think this will also clean up the trending section so that higher quality posts we can all be proud of end up there.</p>
<h2 id="Potential-pitfalls"><a href="#Potential-pitfalls" class="headerlink" title="Potential pitfalls "></a>Potential pitfalls </h2><h2></h2><p>Now, this might be dangerous because it could incentivize whales to make alts, shitpost and re steem on the alt.  This already goes on though to some extent.  We may just need the &#x201C;police&#x201D; to be diligent about that too.  More on that tomorrow&#x2026;</p>
<h2 id="Anyway-drop-your-thoughts"><a href="#Anyway-drop-your-thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Anyway, drop your thoughts "></a>Anyway, drop your thoughts </h2><h2></h2><p>These ideas are 1-day old after a some deep thoughts with @trafalgar.  I&#x2019;m still philosoficating about it.</p>
<p>Do you like it?</p>
<p>How could it be implemented mathematically?</p>
<p>Do you think this could help distribution over time?</p>
<p>If you wanted to incentivize whales to vote for minnow content how would you do it?</p>

<p>Ok, I&#x2019;m determined to send this kid to STEEMFEST.  His handle is @theprophet0.  He&#x2019;s 15, he&#x2019;s a writer for steemsports.  He&#x2019;s a funny and smart kid.  I&#x2019;ve been helping to mentor him on this witness campaign stuff to my own detriment.  I had passed him in the ranking and so we talked about how to go about asking for votes, building a platform, and some of that stuff I learned from my state campaign where I won 6,000 votes (I still lost, but it was a good run).  So, kid turns around and uses my advice and gets @dan to boost him up with a massive vote and he turns around let&#x2019;s me know.  I can only imagine the shit eating grin on his face when he was telling me he just smoked me with a big upvote from the founder!  </p>
<p>He&#x2019;s got this hint of competitiveness that I really appreciate and I&#x2019;m fully in support of this kid.  What&#x2019;s not to like?  The other witnesses have some doubts about his age because his voice is so deep, but excluding that he&#x2019;s a great kid and he&#x2019;s a wonderful story for the platform.  15, witness, writer, making it on the platform.  Honestly, it lifts my spirit and I&#x2019;m determined to help my Steemit friend and fellow Witness.</p>

<p>I Promised $200 SBDs to the travel fund after getting inspired by @ausbitbank and his 1,000 steem donation.</p>
<p>The post earned another 133.  That&#x2019;s 333 SBDs at today&#x2019;s price of $2.11 (eff u dollar peg, market wins) we&#x2019;ll round that to $700!!!  BOOM!  We&#x2019;re awesome.  </p>

<p>Kid just raised $361 on his own here- <a href="https://steemit.com/steemfest2/@theprophet0/your-youngest-witness-is-crowdfunding-a-ticket-to-steemfest2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/steemfest2/@theprophet0/your-youngest-witness-is-crowdfunding-a-ticket-to-steemfest2</a></p>
<p>That&#x2019;s amazing!  We&#x2019;re doing awesome, but I have bad news.  The flight costs $1600 so we&#x2019;re still $600 short.</p>
<h2 id="Time-to-run-one-more-post"><a href="#Time-to-run-one-more-post" class="headerlink" title="Time to run one more post "></a>Time to run one more post </h2><h2></h2><p>So, we have to get this kid there.  I&#x2019;ll match and/or exceed the post rewards from this post to make sure we hit the total of $600.  Here&#x2019;s hoping I don&#x2019;t have to do the whole thing myself, but if that&#x2019;s what it takes to get him there, so be it&#x2026; Here&#x2019;s my pledge @theprophet0.  I&#x2019;m getting you tickets to Steemfest come hell or high water. </p>
<p>Last rewards we raised will go the travel fund, @t-r-f,  with a note that they should be ear marked for you.  All liquid rewards and missing amount to get you the ticket will be sent directly to @theprophet0.  If we exceed his need I&#x2019;ll start another post to start sending some minnows to steemfest that want to go.</p>
<p>Bud, I have good news.  The peeps following this blog are a pretty amazing and generous crowd.  We&#x2019;ll get you there together!</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s pretty simple to me.  We have to be the change we want to see in the world.  I&#x2019;ve been heavily influenced by singer songwriter Utah Phillips.  He&#x2019;s a Vietnam vet turned peace advocate and anarchist.  He talks about about some of that experience in this song written with Ani DeFranco.</p>

<p>The line that gets me is &#x201C;The world has to change, and that change has to start with me.&#x201D;  So, when I look at what&#x2019;s wrong I see violence, I see artificial boarders, I see theft, I see control, and I see poverty.  People seem to think the world is broken, but I&#x2019;ve come to believe it&#x2019;s working exactly as designed.</p>
<p>There are 8 people that have the same net worth as 3-4 billion people.  That&#x2019;s not because they are inherently worth more.  It&#x2019;s because the financial system today is a giant blood sucking squid absorbing wealth from the weakest of us and engorging the richest.  I see the world today as violent, destitute, and controlled and I can&#x2019;t stomach the thought of my kids having to live through this.</p>
<p>So, I have a different vision for the world.  One that is peaceful, one where there is enough wealth to go around, and one where I&#x2019;m free to go about my life without intrusion, without losing a portion of my income to support things I don&#x2019;t like, and towards a world that is worthy of the beauty inherent in my kids and yours.</p>
<p>So, I&#x2019;ve adopted three main values that I use to set my course: <em>Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.</em>  It conveniently spells PAL and hopefully all those who share those beliefs can think of themselves as being PALs to one another.</p>
<h2 id="Steemit&#x2019;s-role"><a href="#Steemit&#x2019;s-role" class="headerlink" title="Steemit&#x2019;s role "></a>Steemit&#x2019;s role </h2><h2></h2><p>I think the world is run by immoral banksters, and they get their power from the ability to print money out of thin air and have the rest of us use it.  They have a monopoly on this printing press.  In the 2008 financial crisis alone the private Federal Reserve Board printed over $16T.  That was the size of the US GDP.  They decided to print as much money as the US&#x2019;s entire economy, and they handed it out to the banks, mostly foreign, that acted recklessly.  Socialized gains and privitized losses isn&#x2019;t capitalism, and having a private bank run this system from behind the curtain isn&#x2019;t a constitutional republic.</p>
<p>So, I want to hit them where it hurts.  If their power comes from printing money and they use that power for violence, destitution, and control I want to take away that power.  Steemit gives us that opportunity.  It&#x2019;s not enough to simply protest the 1% and their systems.  We have to find something to replace what they are doing with something better.  </p>

<p>I think Steemit&#x2019;s it, and every day I can satisfy my needs through Steemit instead of FED notes I&#x2019;ll be happy.  </p>
<h2 id="Growth-Hack-Steemit"><a href="#Growth-Hack-Steemit" class="headerlink" title="Growth Hack Steemit  "></a>Growth Hack Steemit  </h2><h2></h2><p>So, the first thing to do is take my 10 years of sales and marketing experience and use that to help grow this platform.  I&#x2019;ve been in ed tech sales travelling from school to school to promote digital learning.  I&#x2019;ve altered the course of over 100,000 students.  I can do that here, and by doing that I think we can set a different course for ourselves and our future.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s my starting pitch.  And I&#x2019;ll get this refined and on the road.</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/witness/@aggroed/life-on-the-blockchain-a-beginner-s-guide-to-steemit-a-cryptocurrency-empowered-social-media-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/witness/@aggroed/life-on-the-blockchain-a-beginner-s-guide-to-steemit-a-cryptocurrency-empowered-social-media-platform</a></p>
<h2 id="But-it&#x2019;s-not-enough"><a href="#But-it&#x2019;s-not-enough" class="headerlink" title="But it&#x2019;s not enough! "></a>But it&#x2019;s not enough! </h2><h2></h2><p>Once folks get here we have to keep them here.  We need to grow this economy and the trade here.  So, we have to help people grow their accounts.  That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ve started the Minnow Support Project and adding a new series called Minnow School.  The aim is to help those we get to transition here to be successful.  In business terms I&#x2019;m working in Client Success helping new customers who come on board find success and stick around.  The learning curve here is steep, and I&#x2019;m doing my best to flatten it so our community can expand.</p>
<h2 id="Here&#x2019;s-what-that-looks-like-in-5-seconds"><a href="#Here&#x2019;s-what-that-looks-like-in-5-seconds" class="headerlink" title="Here&#x2019;s what that looks like in 5 seconds "></a>Here&#x2019;s what that looks like in 5 seconds </h2><h2></h2><p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3og0INKh2raZUVkEpy/giphy.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Once again I&#x2019;ve called in the support of @juanmiguelsalas.  He&#x2019;s a talented artist and has made gifs for Steemit, a gif for the Minnow Support Project, and now this Witness campaign.  You&#x2019;ll note services were paid in SBD!</p>
<h2 id="If-you-can-support-this-vision-then-please-support-me"><a href="#If-you-can-support-this-vision-then-please-support-me" class="headerlink" title="If you can support this vision then please support me "></a>If you can support this vision then please support me </h2><h2></h2><p>I fight a crappy distribution outside of Steemit, and I fight a crappy distribution on Steemit.  Right now 1% of the steem holders own 90% of the steem.  This makes for some awkward discussions because all the votes are stake weighted.  I need whale votes to rise, but I&#x2019;m uncompromising that the biggest problem internally for Steemit is that the rich hold too much stake.  It leads to a disempowered user base, crappy content on the trending page, and too few people having too much say.</p>
<p>So, in order to counter act the fact that I&#x2019;m bringing with me parts of a message that may be difficult to hear I need your support.  Minnows and Dolphins I need your help to vote for this campaign to show that this is a message and a plan that the authors, curators, and shoppers want&#x2026; it&#x2019;s not just what I want.  And whales, to be clear.  I don&#x2019;t want to take anything away from you!  This isn&#x2019;t a redistribution plan, but what I do want is to give better incentives to the richest members to make it worth their time to find and upvote minnow/dolphin content.  That way we can all be aligned, see this place Moon, and see the world change by our actions.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.  If you think this is a good plan than please vote for me for witness.</p>

<p>Hello Minnows!</p>
<p>What a wonderful day to have you all assembled here.  I&#x2019;m your host.  Dr. Aggroed.</p>
<center> <img src="https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmeTrmfBNWXFMFHkuQgrXFVWdwDE3hRH7TM3HEyMSmngW1/aggroed%206.png" alt=""> </center>

<p>Today, we&#x2019;re on lesson 1.  Creating your mission statement.  Now that we&#x2019;re past the title line this is actually a hidden paid assignment!  I&#x2019;ll pay the top 10 Mission statements 10SBD each that are put in the comments.</p>
<h2 id="In-a-previous-post-I-talked-about-the-value-of-a-mission-statement"><a href="#In-a-previous-post-I-talked-about-the-value-of-a-mission-statement" class="headerlink" title="In a previous post I talked about the value of a mission statement "></a>In a previous post I talked about the value of a mission statement </h2><h2></h2><p><a href="https://steemit.com/witness/@aggroed/witness-run-preparation-mission-statement-problem-statement-vision-statement-initial-witness-plan-stakeholder-involvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/witness/@aggroed/witness-run-preparation-mission-statement-problem-statement-vision-statement-initial-witness-plan-stakeholder-involvement</a></p>
<p>I used it as the basis of my witness run that&#x2019;s now going swimmingly.  Just crept into 53 Witness spot after @kingscrown hooked me up with his vote and some proxied votes.  Good times! </p>
<p>I put some of that mission to use in this piece here dictating the things I work on and build on behalf of the platform.</p>

<p>Your job is to figure out what role you can have here, how you&#x2019;re going to help leave this a better place than the one you found, and act in a consistent manner to find resonance with your audience.  If you do this well you might even catch a resteem.  So, make it good.  I won&#x2019;t pay or release it until all the payout on the post is done.</p>
<h2 id="How-do-we-write-a-mission-statement"><a href="#How-do-we-write-a-mission-statement" class="headerlink" title="How do we write a mission statement "></a>How do we write a mission statement </h2><h2></h2><p>3 steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Think about what you see as the biggest problem you see in the world or the thing you&#x2019;d like to change the most.</li>
<li>Write a vision of what you think it ought to look like instead.</li>
<li>Share a mission that helps get us from here to there.</li>
</ol>
<p>150 words minimum.  Don&#x2019;t try to repeat words you&#x2019;ll get disqualified.  Quality work to get my SBDs.</p>
<p>Posts need to include 3 images.  One for each section.  Try not to make it 100% literal.  Try to think of something in life that evokes the emotions that you&#x2019;re talking about, but without a direct and very obvious link.  </p>
<p>In order to be eligible for a resteem you have to put at least 2 of @elyaque &#x2018;s badges into the footer of your post.</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@elyaque/free-steemit-badges-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/steemit/@elyaque/free-steemit-badges-overview</a></p>
<p>Write the post on your own blog, and then link it in the comments!</p>
<p>Best of luck and keep in touch because more Minnow School posts will follow and they&#x2019;ll have easter egg rewards in the text of the post!</p>
