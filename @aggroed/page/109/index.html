<h1 id="The-Importance-of-Being-Assertive"><a href="#The-Importance-of-Being-Assertive" class="headerlink" title=" The Importance of Being Assertive "></a><center> The Importance of Being Assertive </center></h1><p>Being assertive is a sign of strong, healthy boundaries.<br>When you assert yourself, you are defining your boundaries.</p>
<p>Assertiveness is not aggressiveness.<br>Assertiveness is defining your boundaries while staying within them, while aggressiveness is crossing over into another&#x2019;s boundaries when trying to assert yourself.</p>
<p>Being assertive involves the use of &#x201C;I&#x201D; statements which is <a href="">one of the methods of conflict resolution.</a><br>The use of  &#x201C;I&#x201D; statements is a way to state your wants and needs from the perspective of owning your feelings as opposed to using &#x201C;you&#x201D; statements which can come across as aggressive and blaming.<br>The latter usually just leads to defensiveness and a lack of peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>Assertiveness can be quite difficult for people who are uncomfortable with conflict as it usually involves some amount of tension and not giving in to what the other person wants.<br>Using <a href="https://steemit.com/peaceacademy/@aggroed/the-peace-academy-curriculum-conflict-resolution-part-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflict resolution methods</a> can help guide you through this process.</p>
<p>A lack of assertiveness and healthy boundaries can lead to a victim mentality and a feeling of often getting stepped on in life.  We&#x2019;re fond of the phrase victims are violent, and would warn against victim mentality while trying to come to peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>You must be able to state your needs and be able to say NO when necessary.</p>
<p>Avoiding situations or people because you are avoiding conflict and assertiveness can leave you with a feeling of unsettled stress that will remain until the situation is resolved.</p>

<h1 id="What-is-Emotional-Intelligence"><a href="#What-is-Emotional-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="What is Emotional Intelligence?"></a>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1><p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand, analyze, express, and manage your own emotions while also being able to recognize and respond to the emotions of others.</p>
<p>Emotional Intelligence is just as important as IQ when it comes to truly understanding ourselves and others. It is also a necessary component to achieving and maintaining peace.</p>
<p><strong><em>&#x201C;All learning has an emotional base,&#x201D; - Plato.</em></strong></p>
<p>Emotional intelligence has been referred to as a subset of  Social intelligence and an important component used to guide our overall thinking, decision making, and actions.</p>
<h1 id="The-5-Domains-of-Emotional-Intelligence"><a href="#The-5-Domains-of-Emotional-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="The 5 Domains of Emotional Intelligence"></a>The 5 Domains of Emotional Intelligence</h1><p><strong><em>Self Awareness</em></strong><br>Self Awareness involves recognizing and understanding what our emotions are.  This is not always an easy task. Sometimes we take on the emotions of others on a subconscious level or our emotions just feel like a jumbled mess.<br>We need to take a screen shot of what we are feeling and analyze it, separate our feelings from the feelings of others, and get to the root cause of our feelings in order to correctly identify the emotion and why we are feeling it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Managing Emotions</em></strong><br>This involves controlling and managing our feelings, taking a step back to analyze what we are feeling before acting impulsively, regulating our emotions and responding appropriately, as well as accurately responding to the emotions of others.</p>
<p><strong><em>Social Awareness</em></strong><br>Empathy is the ability to recognize, understand, and empathize with the emotions of others.  It is a key component to achieving and maintaining peace.</p>
<p><strong><em>Relationship Management</em></strong><br>This aspect of emotional intelligence helps with building rapport, compromise, finding common ground, and conflict resolution.</p>
<p><strong><em>Emotional Reasoning</em></strong><br>Once we have awareness and understanding of our emotions, they can help guide our reasoning, cognitive abilities, and decision making and subsequent actions.</p>

<p>I think it&#x2019;s important to hang in there and focus on the positive.  There&#x2019;s a website that&#x2019;s called  blockitivity <a href="http://blocktivity.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://blocktivity.info/</a> that collects block activity and measures them against one another.  It&#x2019;s also a financial tool though because they are comparing market cap of a coin (the total value of coins in circulation) to the activity on the block.  They also share what capacity each blockchain is at.  Here&#x2019;s where we stand today.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmWvXr928BpT7VG1apuo4AjPJLELhRZGP7xRmbvumn25JH/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Steem is trading with eth back and forth for the number one spot on that list.  The list is tracked by how many transactions happen per day.  So, it&#x2019;s great that Steem is number 1.  It means that we&#x2019;re often the most active community for all cryptos period, but there&#x2019;s more to it then that.  We also have a much smaller market cap than coins that have similar activity levels or honestly coins that don&#x2019;t have any community around them.  So if you compare Steem to Bitcoin our ratio of activity to marketcap is 1100 times smaller than theirs.  Another way to think of this is based on block activity Steem is undervalued by 1100 times, and by block activity Steem should be trading at $2,200/coin.</p>
<h2 id="But-wait-there&#x2019;s-more"><a href="#But-wait-there&#x2019;s-more" class="headerlink" title="But wait there&#x2019;s more! "></a>But wait there&#x2019;s more! </h2><h2></h2><p>Next part is that Steem boasts a lot of attractive features that the other coins don&#x2019;t have.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Convenience.  I like having the name aggroed.  I think this would be less fun if I was 345klbigl450435j3245jcock452345j2.  I think it&#x2019;s easier to send money, and from what I see happening it&#x2019;s relatively easy to code things for this blockchain.  It&#x2019;s pretty easy to login, send some money, and punt out a couple of blogs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Transaction time.  I hate waiting for btc and ltc transactions to clear.  I sold the small amount of EOS that I had last night while it was peaking and dipping.  The first time I sent the transaction it didn&#x2019;t go through.  The second time it took forever.  It&#x2019;s not just that I&#x2019;m impatient it&#x2019;s that cryptos change quickly and if you&#x2019;re an active trader then 30 minutes or multiple attempts at 30 minutes could be 30 plus trades that you missed out on while shit was waiting for confirmations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Steem doesn&#x2019;t have that problem.  Because it&#x2019;s DPoS this bitch is fast.  So, our transactions take 3 seconds.  That&#x2019;s lightening fast, and you might actually be able to build some reasonable commerce off of it.  Steem Connect makes that easy and simple.</p>
<ol>
<li>Transaction cost:  Have you even tried to send btc recently?  I might as well just give the miners all of it.  This is an incredibly hungry network that&#x2019;s currently using double digit percentages of the world&#x2019;s energy supply.  It&#x2019;s fucking crazy&#x2026;</li>
</ol>
<p>Steem and SBD are free to send!  Stop giving the miners all your money and start trading in Steem.  </p>
<ol>
<li>Transactions actually go through:  Crypto Kitties is taking up 25% of the Eth network.  When the next fad like that hits you won&#x2019;t be able to use Eth.  BTC and Eth have around 120k unconfirmed transactions between the two of them.  It&#x2019;s horrible.  A year from now you&#x2019;re going to spend half your money just sending the money.  It&#x2019;s worse than credit cards taking 2-5%.</li>
</ol>
<p>Without any technological improvement Steem can grow it&#x2019;s number of transactions 300x and keep on ticking.  Witness server costs will probably go up, but you&#x2019;ll be covered and ok.  It&#x2019;s gonna be fast, it&#x2019;s gonna work, and it&#x2019;s gonna be free.</p>
<h2 id="We&#x2019;re-the-gateway-drug-to-the-mainstream"><a href="#We&#x2019;re-the-gateway-drug-to-the-mainstream" class="headerlink" title="We&#x2019;re the gateway drug to the mainstream "></a>We&#x2019;re the gateway drug to the mainstream </h2><h2></h2><p>Where are new people going to hit the market?  Some really complicated coin?  Some financial instrument?  or a site where you can blog and get paid.  Steem is a network built for a social media world.  It might be a little tricky to get but as this price rises (led by SBDs) we&#x2019;re going to keep tearing off facebook, reddit, and other competitors and drag them into crypto.  We&#x2019;re starting this process with youtube as well.  Just this Sunday I&#x2019;ll have 3 people on a radio show with me representing 1.6M subscribers.  And they feel incentivized to come over here because youtube is paying them less or nothing and apparently they like eating and being able to pay their rent.</p>
<h2 id="Steem-has-one-of-the-best-outlooks-around"><a href="#Steem-has-one-of-the-best-outlooks-around" class="headerlink" title="Steem has one of the best outlooks around "></a>Steem has one of the best outlooks around </h2><h2></h2><p>Despite our user interface, despite our distribution, despite the learning curve we&#x2019;re gonna be the first to really mainstream and it&#x2019;s gonna add a lot of people and an enormous amount of wealth around here.  I&#x2019;m still just gonna HODL and stockpile this stuff as much as I can because I think there&#x2019;s still tons of room for growth.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m looking forward to what 2018 will bring.  Get your shit together and carve out some more time for Steem because I don&#x2019;t think we can stay this undervalued forever.</p>

<p>I wanted to work through a couple of thoughts on using steembottracker to help people make better decisions when they are using the bidbots.  So, I recorded this video below and I basically walk people through the site.</p>
<p>If you missed my last milestone post I gained 1k followers in the last week.  I attribute it to a few things, but bid bots played a role.  So, I wanted to show other people how it&#x2019;s done.  I&#x2019;m co-owner of this site now for full disclosure sake, and hopefully you realize that bid bots are fun, have a promotional purpose, but definately carry risk (especially with sbd trading at 10USD).  Here I try to reduce that risk for you as much as possible by giving the best explanation I can.</p>

<p>It seems like only 14 days ago that I posted on the fact that I had 7k followers.  My average experience on the platform is such that I&#x2019;ve been gaining something like 13 followers/day.  It&#x2019;s not linear like that at all, and in fact there&#x2019;s a fair amount of flux between people following and then unfollowing.  Overall though you take the number of followers and divide by 550 days (a rough estimate of how long I&#x2019;ve been here) then you get about 13/day.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s my 7k announcement post- <a href="https://steemit.com/milestone/@aggroed/7-000-follower-milestone-post" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/milestone/@aggroed/7-000-follower-milestone-post</a></p>
<h2 id="Let&#x2019;s-look-at-this-most-recent-change"><a href="#Let&#x2019;s-look-at-this-most-recent-change" class="headerlink" title="Let&#x2019;s look at this most recent change "></a>Let&#x2019;s look at this most recent change </h2><h2></h2><p>Over the last 14 days I&#x2019;ve picked up 1,000 followers.  This is closer to an average of 70 followers per day.  What&#x2019;s changed in the last two weeks that could explain what&#x2019;s going on?</p>
<p>At the moment I&#x2019;m attributing this to a few things.  Some good work for the platform, being a witness, and bid bots.  Yes, bid bots.</p>
<h2 id="Good-work"><a href="#Good-work" class="headerlink" title="Good work "></a>Good work </h2><h2></h2><p>The main thing that I&#x2019;ve done recently is host a completely baller panel discussion for the Steem ecosystem.  I helped create, fund, tangentially manage, promote, and invest in the msp-waves broadcast station.  I now use that in conjunction with being a witness to gather folks for intelligent discussion.  My last project was to get 7 of the top witnesses and largest accounts together to have a steem panel discussion.  Before that I had a Steem Growth Forum that attracted some major players and a large live audience.  This Sunday I have 3 youtubers with a combined 1.6M followers coming on muh show.  After that I&#x2019;m looking to get a 5M Youtube Subscriber panel going and a crypto growth forum together.  </p>
<p>I&#x2019;m trying to get a lot of shit done while helping to promote minnow work (see a lovejuice post coming soon), improve bid bot function and transparency, and help run and manage the Minnow Support Project (which is up to around 5,500 people).  I do a ton of shit around here that helps grow this ecosystem.  So, I do good for the Steem network because this place is my digital home.  I feel like I&#x2019;m being rewarded for that!</p>
<h2 id="I&#x2019;m-a-witness"><a href="#I&#x2019;m-a-witness" class="headerlink" title="I&#x2019;m a witness "></a>I&#x2019;m a witness </h2><h2></h2><p>Being a witness on the block can help personal growth.  It&#x2019;s news to talk about witness stuff so you have some content that&#x2019;s meaningful to the platform, but I think it can also come with some street cred.  People on the block are more willing to listen and work with witnesses because witnesses serve an incredibly important function around here.  You can be a bad witness and that won&#x2019;t help much.  You can be a good person and that will help.  Combining being a good person with being a good witness can do a lot to help you grow.</p>
<p>So, I&#x2019;m encouraging folks to be a witness.  If you&#x2019;re looking for free lambos you&#x2019;re gonna be disappointed.  It&#x2019;s a ton of work and takes forever to make progress, but if you love Steem, this community and these people, you have some moderate computer skills, some decent understanding of economics, and can disagree with people pleasantly without calling them all ignorant useless assholes when they disagree with you then you might just make the cut and find success.</p>
<p>Combine good work and good witnessing and you&#x2019;ll do well.  That accounts for some of my growth too.</p>
<h2 id="Bid-Bots"><a href="#Bid-Bots" class="headerlink" title="Bid Bots "></a>Bid Bots </h2><h2></h2><p>Ok, here&#x2019;s the controversial part of this.  I started my bid bot experiment 2 weeks ago.  I&#x2019;ve invested thousands of dollars into bid bots over the last two weeks.  I&#x2019;ve gotten a healthy return on that investment and it&#x2019;s come in three forms.  I&#x2019;ve grown my follower count, I&#x2019;ve caught some larger votes because of it, and I&#x2019;ve made a decent return on my bidbot investments.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m growing very quickly and I think it&#x2019;s important to note that I delegate so much SP that I often lose my slider.  I&#x2019;ve noticed people on this platform like to vote for people that can vote them back.  It&#x2019;s not quite as explicit as a well defined circle jerk, it&#x2019;s not quite a community, it&#x2019;s more like a nod and a wink that big votes will come back to them.   I can&#x2019;t do that (at least with my own sp).  My growth is impacted positively as a witness for delegating basically everything I get to community projects and new community members, but it is hampered by not being able to vote folks back.  At least this way I can suggest a return will be made because I&#x2019;m happy to come over the top of their vote with a large bid bot vote and at least help the people supporting me get good curation rewards.</p>
<p>Some of this works because people think I&#x2019;m insane.  I think that sbd is going to go up in value instead of going down to 1 USD/SBD.  It has a few things going for it.  Zero fees, 3 second transactions, our block can increase in scale 300x without breaking a sweat, and You.  Yes you.  We have a fucking awesome community of smart people working on this biatch day in and day out.  Oh, and there&#x2019;s only 3.6M of these little guys.  So, if you want to move money around freely, without hassle, quickly, and on a platform that will process it immediately then Steem and SBD are a good bet.  If you like that there&#x2019;s only 3.6M instead of 260M of them then SBD looks even better.</p>
<p>All that is to say that people look at SBD as a risky investment right now.  I understand that.  We say it&#x2019;s a pegged currency that is going to stay at 1 dollar worth of steem.  I actually think that&#x2019;s a misnomer on the site.  We have a backstopped currency that witnesses can guarantee won&#x2019;t drop below $1 because we can increase the interest paid on SBD.  We can theoretically print more SBDs to counter the price increase, but that exposes us to having more debt notes and a lot of witnesses don&#x2019;t want to do that because if SBD tanks and we have to pump up the interest we could be shovelling an absurd amount of money to back them up.  It&#x2019;s better to keep fewer of them around.  All that is to say we can keep the price from going below 1, but we can&#x2019;t really keep the price from going high without terrible risks, so we have a backstop rather than a peg, and that means SBD can be worth a ton more money.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s my thinking on it, and that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m investing in bid bots now even though the price of sbd may crash.  The fear of it crashing has made it possible to use bidbots, promote my posts, and see a return.  The risk is that it tanks, but I&#x2019;m a crazy mofo with some SBD to play with and I think it&#x2019;s gonna rise.  So, right now I&#x2019;m breaking even or profitting on the bidbot by accepting the risk SBD tanks, and if I&#x2019;m right I&#x2019;m going to make an assload of money while having promoted my posts, gained followers, and caught some extra large whale votes for the effort.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s my experiment: <a href="https://steemit.com/bidbot/@aggroed/a-one-week-experiment-putting-bidbots-to-good-use-by-upvoting-my-posts-at-around-the-6-day-mark" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/bidbot/@aggroed/a-one-week-experiment-putting-bidbots-to-good-use-by-upvoting-my-posts-at-around-the-6-day-mark</a>.  I think it&#x2019;s gone pretty well.  We&#x2019;ll see though if I&#x2019;m left holding a ton of SBDs worth only 1 USD (cause then I&#x2019;d have lost a lot of money), but at the very least I&#x2019;ve certainly fueled growth on this account by the bid bot experiment.</p>

"></a>How&#x2019;d I grow 1k followers in 2 weeks instead of my normal 12? </h2><h2></h2><p>Good work for the block, good witnessing, and a large investment in bid bots</p>
<h2 id="There&#x2019;s-a-financial-risk-to-bid-bots"><a href="#There&#x2019;s-a-financial-risk-to-bid-bots" class="headerlink" title="There&#x2019;s a financial risk to bid bots "></a>There&#x2019;s a financial risk to bid bots </h2><h2></h2><p>Just to be clear.  There&#x2019;s a financial risk to using bid bots.  SBD may very well crash, and if it does you&#x2019;ll lose a lot of cash if you have a large bid into one.  So, be careful.  You should be using steembottracker.com to help you make smart bids.  I&#x2019;m gonna post a tutorial on that later tonight or tomorrow.  But bidbotting is a little like gambling and if you have to use SBD to pay rent or feed your family I would highly discourage it for large votes.  Just be careful with your money please.</p>
<h2 id="Mainly-Thank-You"><a href="#Mainly-Thank-You" class="headerlink" title="Mainly Thank You! "></a>Mainly Thank You! </h2><h2></h2><p>I guess I just want to continue to say thank you for your support.  It&#x2019;s one of the most exceptional honors of my life to represent this community as a witness, on the radio, and in my beloved PAlnet and MSP community.  Thanks for following me.  Thanks for voting me.  Thanks for letting me be a part of this exceptional place.  </p>
<p>I hope my insights on the last 2 weeks are helpful to you and yours as you consider how you might help the network, grow your account, think about running a witness campaign if you&#x2019;re not already doing it, and use bid bots as a force for good on the platform.  And to all my new followers let me extend an extremely grateful high five!  Good times and here&#x2019;s hoping you learn something about this place that helps you and it grow!</p>
