<p>I have altered my delegated steem power.  I have removed my steem power from @minnowsupport which funds a publicly accessible bot that anyone can use from within the PALnet Discord server.  I have placed it into @msp-lovebot and added a few thousand SP on top.  The @minnowsupport bot is still well north of 120,000 SP.  So, this is a special way to thank and help the little guys who do a lot.</p>
<h2 id="HF-19-adjustments"><a href="#HF-19-adjustments" class="headerlink" title="HF 19 adjustments "></a>HF 19 adjustments </h2><h2></h2><p>This approach in particular is a consequence of the latest hardfork.  The hardfork was very much designed so it would kill bot voting.  What I will do instead is create additional accounts and delegate to them.  I&#x2019;ll have power on my main account to provide Dank Amps to good posts.  I&#x2019;ll have smurfs to support authors I enjoy and think help this platform and they&#x2019;ll benefit from bot use.</p>
<h2 id="MSP"><a href="#MSP" class="headerlink" title="MSP "></a>MSP </h2><h2></h2><p>The Minnow Support Project is run by a crew of people who have gone through a variety of steps.  Some just help the bot, others help new people, and some have gone on to create sub communities within PALnet and are working on larger projects such as a steady supply of podcasts from &#x201C;the (minnow) Pond,&#x201D; poetry contests, writing support, and a steady stream of howtos.</p>
<p>You can find a great recent example of being an awesome minnow from @melkay and her #womenofsteemit tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/womenofsteemit/@melkay/introducing-womenofsteemit-a-steemit-orginal-series-tag-and-movement-rolled-into-one-competition-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/womenofsteemit/@melkay/introducing-womenofsteemit-a-steemit-orginal-series-tag-and-movement-rolled-into-one-competition-time</a></p>
<p>She&#x2019;s helping to create a sub community for women with the PALnet Discord server along with fellow Minnow Support Project members to help get women up and running and a supportive team around them.  It doesn&#x2019;t take much digging on the internet to find incredibly abusive people with an extra degree of spite towards women.  It&#x2019;s nice to see a community take shape and offer positive vibes and help.  I&#x2019;m pumped to support her with a channel she has complete authority over in the PALnet Discord room and hope that her continued leadership helps bring more women to the platform.</p>
<h2 id="msp-lovebot"><a href="#msp-lovebot" class="headerlink" title="@msp-lovebot "></a>@msp-lovebot </h2><h2></h2><p>So, it&#x2019;s hard to argue with supporting good people like that.  So, @msp-lovebot is here to help minnows that are giving back more than just the folks that stop in one time and leave.  For now it&#x2019;s just a little dolphin, but here&#x2019;s hoping over time it grows and really kicks in.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s likely we&#x2019;re going to hit our 2,000th person to come through the channel by Saturday.  Hopefully you&#x2019;re one of them.  It&#x2019;s pretty vibrant on here.  If you&#x2019;re a minnow and you&#x2019;re not in the channel then I&#x2019;d argue you&#x2019;re doing Steemit wrong.</p>
<h2 id="Minnow-Support-Project"><a href="#Minnow-Support-Project" class="headerlink" title="Minnow Support Project "></a>Minnow Support Project </h2><h2></h2><p>Come for the bots.  Stay for the community.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m terming this brand of fiction cryptopunk.  It&#x2019;s like diesel punk or steampunk, but it&#x2019;s based on a libertarian crypto society.  This one happens to be science fiction.  So, call it sci-fi cryptopunk if you want.  Anyway, Santana is about to kick ass.  Let&#x2019;s watch.</p>
<h2 id="Episode-7-Consequences"><a href="#Episode-7-Consequences" class="headerlink" title="Episode 7- Consequences "></a>Episode 7- Consequences </h2><h2></h2><p>Tanic put down his new son Tanic Jr.  A blobby smily sort of child.  His eyes would wander around the room with curiosity.  Venessa, the mother, was on the bed.  It was awkward telling Margaret about what happened.  To her he had left for a minor mission, but for him it was 2-years and unclear if he&#x2019;d ever return.  Vanessa provided relief and a chance for a life, but now that he was back in his original universe it was difficult to explain.  It was mostly going back and forth on calls with endless sobbing.  He loved her dearly, but he hoped she would understand that it wasn&#x2019;t intentional infidelity.  What happens in other time lines and dimensions stays in them&#x2026; except for children.</p>
<p>He tickled Tanic Jr one more time and went to the bridge.</p>
<p> Tanic Elotaw allowed himself a smirk as his newly retrofitted Dreadnaught class Peace Enforcer exited Quantum slip outside of Nagan VII accompanied by two additional Peace Enforcers 141007 and 154022.  His weapons were ready.  Margaret hadn&#x2019;t snapped at him in a few hours, and Nagan VII was about to be bombarded to pieces.  He tugged his uniform tight and started his broadcast.</p>
<p>&#x201C;People of Nagan VII.  Your insurrection against the Kartouri Civilization is at an end.  Unless you issue uncondional surrender and agree to annexation by writ of Councilor Mago your civilization will be nuetrali&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
<p>The broadcast cut out unexpectedly.  The screen went blank, and after a brief disruption it flickered and his nemesis &#x201C;Admiral&#x201D; Santana appeared. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Tanic, I&#x2019;m sorry to see you again.  We have prepared for your arrival and will unroll the welcome mat if you don&#x2019;t leave immediately.  Head back to your Kartouri shithole either in peace or pieces.  The option is yours.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic laughed.  &#x201C;Santana, you may not know this but I&#x2019;ve been waiting two years for this opportunity.  I&#x2019;ve come with friends and the latest technology available to Kartouri.  We hereby suggest you power down, lay down your arms and prepare to be boarded.  We have no intention of leaving without annexati..&#x201D;  again the screen cut out.  There was a brief high pitched squeel, and then a hard hitting bass rythm starting pounding at rediculous levels on the bridge.  This was followed by a hard hitting drum solo on top of it.&#x201D;  He plugged his ears.  </p>
<p>His new weapons officer Digs started shouting, but it was broken up by the noise.  &#x201C;Com&#x2026; de.r.  There.. bogie&#x2026;. 360..&#x201D;  Tanic looked at the tactical display and saw several hundreds blips appear.  He also saw &#x201C;operation excessive fuckery&#x201D; on the screen.  &#x201C;Give me a visual&#x201D; he shouted, but Digs indicated he couldn&#x2019;t hear.  </p>
<p>The next second he was on the ground.  He looked at the HUD and saw 3 deck floors flashing yellow and apparently depressurizing.  He ran to the window and saw a flurry of torpedoes hitting his ship.  He knocked the ensign out of his chair and steered the ship towards the bogie, but his dreadnaught didn&#x2019;t respond.  The engines were powering down, and even life support was turned off.  He went back to the window and saw the other two peace enforcers were dark, and then his lights went off.  All that was left was functional was the deafening sound of the viking crypto metal band Fyrce pouding in the speakers.  A blast went off on the bridge knocking him down and unconscious.  </p>
<p>It was the last sound he heard as Santana&#x2019;s small fleet picked apart his ships apart.</p>
<h2 id="Episode-6-unintentionally-skipped"><a href="#Episode-6-unintentionally-skipped" class="headerlink" title="Episode 6 unintentionally skipped :) "></a>Episode 6 unintentionally skipped :) </h2><h2></h2><h2 id="Episode-5-Back-on-track"><a href="#Episode-5-Back-on-track" class="headerlink" title="Episode 5-  Back on track "></a>Episode 5-  Back on track </h2><h2></h2><p>Santana&#x2019;s eyes opened to meet the hot deathly bright lights of an engulfing inferno.  In truth it was just morning after a pity-party rager, but when the sun came into her room and her eyes opened it burned.  </p>
<p>The last few hours haven&#x2019;t been great sleep by any means.  Puking up 2 bottles of gin and and wiping up leftover vomit with tear soaked shirts isn&#x2019;t cool, but you gotta purge.  Those fucking Karts killed Heather.  They&#x2019;ve been flying together since they were kids.  Heather used to bully Santana.  She&#x2019;d knock her icecream off the cone.  She put glitterbugs in her lunches, but by high school they were close friends, and after college they started patrolling together.  15 years flying together.  You face death.  You save lives.  You really get to know someone and their courage.  </p>
<p>It&#x2019;s not vengence.  We have a right to live as we please without some empire staking a claim here.  We have a right to peace, abudance, and liberty.  We have a right to live in our own right in our own way.  That said.  This one&#x2019;s about vengence too.</p>
<p>Nagan VII News Network braodcasted out footage of the Kart ship popping back in after the slider.  Looked pretty different.  Guess it&#x2019;s been out there a while.  teehee.  Looked ragged as shit.  So, it&#x2019;s probably going back for repairs at the military base, which means she has to get her ship and a group of Nagan fuckery experts together.</p>
<p>She got up, washed her face, and quickly changed.  She grabbed her tech tab, turned the display brightness down low, and took a peek.</p>
<p>Her post hit 14 Trillion liberty scripts.  Looks like brother Johal hooked it up along with whizkid.  She made a note to drop thank you notes. </p>
<p> Santana checked her messages.  Muxxy and Welk both bit her up.  Looks like two great shipmates to have on board.  She put in a call to MK down at the shipyard.  Yes they have a ship, yes it&#x2019;s expensive, yes it has the latest shield technology, yes it can jam Kart fuckers with some epic Viking Heavy Crypto Metal.  12T scripts?  Sold.  That&#x2019;s a few extra for some extra crew.  </p>
<p>She pulled up fleetlist.net.  Put out a contract for an engineer and a ship weapons expert.  She won&#x2019;t have a lot of time, but it should be enough to get her bird in the air and a little flying under her belt.</p>
<p>Time to call Mystique and see if she&#x2019;s got her bird ready for a fight too.  Fuckery is&#x2019;a brewin&#x2019;.</p>

            <p>We&#x2019;re here with you live from our Studio in NYC.  So glad you could join us today.  We have on the show a new special guest with us.  He&#x2019;s been making appearances all over the comments section of your posts it&#x2019;s blogger @ionlysaymeep.  Thanks so much for being here.</p>
<p><a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fjimhillmedia.com%2Fmb%2Fimages%2Fupload%2FBunsen-Beaker-web.jpg&amp;f=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fjimhillmedia.com%2Fmb%2Fimages%2Fupload%2FBunsen-Beaker-web.jpg&amp;f=1</a></p>
<p>ag- So, meep, Let&#x2019;s start when you were young.  Any brothers or sisters?</p>
<p>meep- meep</p>
<p>ag- interesting.  Now this is a bit of a fun performance art piece that you&#x2019;re doing on the blockchain.  What inspired you?</p>
<p>meep- meep</p>
<p>ag- Ok, I should have seen that coming.  We&#x2019;ve recently had a new hard fork land.  H19 titled &#x201C;Equality.&#x201D;  What do you think of it?  Have you noticed any changes to your post value?  Have you noticed any effect of the ~40% drop to the rewards pool since then?</p>
<p>meep- meep</p>
<p>ag- yes, I think we&#x2019;ve all been experiencing it.  How do you feel about a quadrupling of power of votes in the comment section?  Do you feel that is whales commenting on other people&#x2019;s posts or simply upvoting themselves and raping the pool?</p>
<p>meep- meep</p>
<p>ag- woah, those that&#x2019;s a powerful understanding.  Have you been following the news at all?  What do you think of Trump and the Republicans going for healthcare?</p>
<p>meep- meep</p>
<p>ag- let&#x2019;s end this on a positive note.  Recently, @acidyo made a pretty hillarious video where he turned himself into the hitler character in the  Hitler learns he lost video whilst making an epic rant.  Do you know anything that might top that?</p>
<p>meep- meep</p>
<p>ag- well, lastly, the Minnow Support Project and PALnet celebrated having more than 1600 members in the channel.  Last night there were more in the room than any other Steemit based Discord groups out there.  It was an exciting night.  Were you able to partake?</p>
<p>meep- meep</p>
<p>Well, that&#x2019;s all the time we have now folks.  Thanks for joining us for this rivetting interview.</p>
<p>(the contents within are a simultaneous mixture of fiction and non-fiction.  This interview didn&#x2019;t actually take place, but you can imagine if it did what his answers may have been.  Anyways, meep may or may not have consented to this.  I did ask, but you can guess his answer&#x2026;.)</p>

<p>The universe teaches through contrast.  So, I&#x2019;ve made a highly bureaucratic government the antagonist and a free loving libertarian voluntaryst community the protagonist.  Let&#x2019;s see what happens to Admiral Santanta.</p>
<h2 id="Episode-5-Back-on-track"><a href="#Episode-5-Back-on-track" class="headerlink" title="Episode 5-  Back on track "></a>Episode 5-  Back on track </h2><h2></h2><p>Santana&#x2019;s eyes opened to meet the hot deathly bright lights of an engulfing inferno.  In truth it was just morning after a pity-party rager, but when the sun came into her room and her eyes opened it burned.  </p>
<p>The last few hours haven&#x2019;t been great sleep by any means.  Puking up 2 bottles of gin and and wiping up leftover vomit with tear soaked shirts isn&#x2019;t cool, but you gotta purge.  Those fucking Karts killed Heather.  They&#x2019;ve been flying together since they were kids.  Heather used to bully Santana.  She&#x2019;d knock her icecream off the cone.  She put glitterbugs in her lunches, but by high school they were close friends, and after college they started patrolling together.  15 years flying together.  You face death.  You save lives.  You really get to know someone and their courage.  </p>
<p>It&#x2019;s not vengence.  We have a right to live as we please without some empire staking a claim here.  We have a right to peace, abudance, and liberty.  We have a right to live in our own right in our own way.  That said.  This one&#x2019;s about vengence too.</p>
<p>Nagan VII News Network braodcasted out footage of the Kart ship popping back in after the slider.  Looked pretty different.  Guess it&#x2019;s been out there a while.  teehee.  Looked ragged as shit.  So, it&#x2019;s probably going back for repairs at the military base, which means she has to get her ship and a group of Nagan fuckery experts together.</p>
<p>She got up, washed her face, and quickly changed.  She grabbed her tech tab, turned the display brightness down low, and took a peek.</p>
<p>Her post hit 14 Trillion liberty scripts.  Looks like brother Johal hooked it up along with whizkid.  She made a note to drop thank you notes. </p>
<p> Santana checked her messages.  Muxxy and Welk both bit her up.  Looks like two great shipmates to have on board.  She put in a call to MK down at the shipyard.  Yes they have a ship, yes it&#x2019;s expensive, yes it has the latest shield technology, yes it can jam Kart fuckers with some epic Viking Heavy Crypto Metal.  12T scripts?  Sold.  That&#x2019;s a few extra for some extra crew.  </p>
<p>She pulled up fleetlist.net.  Put out a contract for an engineer and a ship weapons expert.  She won&#x2019;t have a lot of time, but it should be enough to get her bird in the air and a little flying under her belt.</p>
<p>Time to call Mystique and see if she&#x2019;s got her bird ready for a fight too.  Fuckery is&#x2019;a brewin&#x2019;.</p>
<h2 id="Episode-4-Time-to-rebuild"><a href="#Episode-4-Time-to-rebuild" class="headerlink" title="Episode 4-  Time to rebuild "></a>Episode 4-  Time to rebuild </h2><h2></h2><p>Captain Tanic Elotaw of the Dreadnaught class ship Peace Enforcer 782215 was happy-ish.  The quantum node was generated.  The slip occured, and he was back to the rough time, galaxy, and space he desired, but it literally took two years of his life to do.  It turns out that trying rebuild the quantum pulse reactor when it&#x2019;s heavily damaged, 2/3 of the engineering crew is dead, and you&#x2019;re in a jurassic age dimension is harder than it seems.</p>
<p>So, two years have passed for him, but it looks like he landed his ship within a day or so of his fight with Terrorist Santana.  Also, the coordinates weren&#x2019;t perfect.  It would appear it would take him two to three days to get back to the terrorist instigators, but two-three days is enough time for those little hive mind fuckers to get ships and defenses back up.  </p>
<p>Even worse than that is the signal jamming they do.  It&#x2019;s hard to get orders to everyone on the ship to exactly coordinate attacks when you can&#x2019;t relay a simple voice command.  He&#x2019;s even had his speakers start blaring cryrotoproic death metal or sometimes just get screaming vikings in his headset.  </p>
<p>So, Star System 004-221/4 is close by.  There&#x2019;s a military base there.  Time to restock and crush Santana.  It&#x2019;s also time to call his family.  Margaret will be thrilled that&#x2019;s he&#x2019;s been gone for two years and simultaneously hasn&#x2019;t.</p>

<p>The universe teaches through contrast.  So, I&#x2019;ve made a highly bureaucratic government the antagonist and a free loving libertarian voluntaryst community the protagonist.  Let&#x2019;s see what happens to Admiral Santanta.</p>
<h2 id="Episode-4-Time-to-rebuild"><a href="#Episode-4-Time-to-rebuild" class="headerlink" title="Episode 4-  Time to rebuild "></a>Episode 4-  Time to rebuild </h2><h2></h2><p>Captain Tanic Elotaw of the Dreadnaught class ship Peace Enforcer 782215 was happy-ish.  The quantum node was generated.  The slip occured, and he was back to the rough time, galaxy, and space he desired, but it literally took two years of his life to do.  It turns out that trying rebuild the quantum pulse reactor when it&#x2019;s heavily damaged, 2/3 of the engineering crew is dead, and you&#x2019;re in a jurassic age dimension is harder than it seems.</p>
<p>So, two years have passed for him, but it looks like he landed his ship within a day or so of his fight with Terrorist Santana.  Also, the coordinates weren&#x2019;t perfect.  It would appear it would take him two to three days to get back to the terrorist instigators, but two-three days is enough time for those little hive mind fuckers to get ships and defenses back up.  </p>
<p>Even worse than that is the signal jamming they do.  It&#x2019;s hard to get orders to everyone on the ship to exactly coordinate attacks when you can&#x2019;t relay a simple voice command.  He&#x2019;s even had his speakers start blaring cryrotoproic death metal or sometimes just get screaming vikings in his headset.  </p>
<p>So, Star System 004-221/4 is close by.  There&#x2019;s a military base there.  Time to restock and crush Santana.  It&#x2019;s also time to call his family.  Margaret will be thrilled that&#x2019;s he&#x2019;s been gone for two years and simultaneously hasn&#x2019;t.</p>
<h2 id="Previous-CH1-Episode-3-Plummeting-with-a-Techtab-and-Solarnet&#x201D;"><a href="#Previous-CH1-Episode-3-Plummeting-with-a-Techtab-and-Solarnet&#x201D;" class="headerlink" title="Previous- CH1 Episode 3 Plummeting with a Techtab and Solarnet&#x201D;"></a>Previous- CH1 Episode 3 Plummeting with a Techtab and Solarnet&#x201D;</h2><p><a href="https://steemit.com/flashfiction/@aggroed/nagan-7-ch1-episode-3-plummeting-with-techtab-and-solarnet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/flashfiction/@aggroed/nagan-7-ch1-episode-3-plummeting-with-techtab-and-solarnet</a></p>
<p>For a lot of people dropping at above mach speeds plummeting towards the ground in a hunk of steel labelled &#x201C;life support ship&#x201D; you&#x2019;d probably be freaked out of your mind, screaming, or passed out.  But to Santana this was just another day at the office.  When you fight for freedom your ship&#x2019;s gonna get blown up a few times.  Oh well, the last couple life boats worked out ok.</p>
<p>She knows the drill by now.  When she saw 3 torps coming in post slider heading for baby-3 she knew what was up.  Hit the big red &#x201C;abandon ship&#x201D; button, punch in the code, grab her techtab, retrieve the video logs, and hop in the life boat.  A lot of her crew and friends were dead.  That happens too&#x2026;  There&#x2019;s gonna be a long bath and a few bottles of wine for today, and by wine she means straight gin.  Mistakes demand their due.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the task at hand.  She pulls out the techtab and logs into solarnet.  Luckily reception is good because she can see the satellite about 1 click from her head.  </p>
<p>&#x201C;Tarthi, pull up libertygov.net for me please.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Libertygov.net pulls up.  Woah, 320,412 new messages.  Oh, right.  She was broadcasting the fight with the raiders.  I guess they&#x2019;re paying attention.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Tarthi, submit new post.&#x201D;</p>
<p>-New Post Ready</p>
<p>&#x201C;Tarthi, roll film&#x201D;</p>

<p>Hi guys.  This is Admiral Santana floating back to home.  As you can see it&#x2019;s a little rough in the atmosphere right now.  I think I&#x2019;m falling at about 534megalons per second.  Anyway, as you might have seen, I had a little run in with the Kartouri Raiders.  Good news is that the planet is safe and none of you are dead.  I can&#x2019;t wait to see you mom.  The bad news is that they blew up my ship.  I try not to ask you guys for too much, but seeing as I did just save the planet again if you could kindly upvote this so I can get a new ship and keep the planet safe that&#x2019;d be really awesome.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m hoping for some improvements, so if a few megaloths could hit it with their megaloth balls or just DM some Liberty Scripts to my wallet that would be great.  I think the shields need moar power.  Also, I seem to have lost some crew so if you&#x2019;re ready to die to keep this place safe from the Karts then hit me up when I land.</p>
<p>Love you guys and thanks for your support.  </p>
<p>Peace, Abundance, and Liberty to you all.</p>
<p>Links below in case you missed the fight!</p>
<p>Santana out.</p>
