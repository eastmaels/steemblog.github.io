<p>This was a pretty crazy Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  The big story out of this is that I had a chance to speak with David Pantone who is the son of Paul Pantone.  Paul was the creator of the GEET engine.  They make the claim that you can take a generator from Harbor Freight Tools and use parts from Home Debot worth roughly a few hundred and convert the traditional engine into a GEET engine.  The advantage of the GEET is that the engine is able to run on a mixture of gasoline and water.  </p>
<p>This seems pretty impossible to many people.  I remain skeptical, but I saw this operating once a few months back in Maine when I met Jeremy up there.  So, I&#x2019;m thinking it&#x2019;s worth exploring.  I&#x2019;m a PhD chemist, but I&#x2019;m not an electrician or a mechanic.  I&#x2019;m open to the chance I&#x2019;m getting duped here, but also cautious.  So, I&#x2019;m bringing @r0nd0n up with me who is an electrician to lay a second set of eyes on this thing.  I&#x2019;m also bringing a camcorder and we&#x2019;ll film it with a skeptics eye.</p>
<p>Step 1.  Look at it with R0n on Sunday (includes filming and posting)<br>Step 2.  Test it out with a small unit on an RV<br>Step 3.  Figure out if we believe it<br>Step 4.  Upgrade wiring in my house (has to happen anyway)<br>Step 5.  Buy a Harbor Freight Tools generator<br>Step 6.  Have them tweak it<br>Step 7.  Hook it up</p>

<p>I like to think I&#x2019;m awakened person.  I like to think that I&#x2019;m spiritually aligned with values that will promote the entire human race, and am aware of challenges to implementing a better world.  @daniarnold is one of the handful people on this planet that I would credit with some of the best parts of my personal development.  She&#x2019;s a Canadian living in Malta.  She&#x2019;s a former military medic.  She&#x2019;s kind, thoughtful, caring, and brings with her a moderately sized, but extremely dedicated following.  They are collectively known as the unfuckers, as in, those who would unfuck the world.</p>
<p>Dani&#x2019;s subject matter can be controversial to some, completely woo (highly esoteric in nature), and sometimes just damn good reporting of events.  She&#x2019;s been in counter cultural intelligence for years, and has some direct experience exposing high crimes and dangerous activities of people in power.  She&#x2019;s pretty fucking awesome.  She just got more awesome because now she&#x2019;s on Steem!</p>

<h2 id="Dani-is-an-indy-news-agent"><a href="#Dani-is-an-indy-news-agent" class="headerlink" title="Dani is an indy news agent "></a>Dani is an indy news agent </h2><h2></h2><p>If you&#x2019;re looking for hard to find news articles that highlight bullshit various government agencies are doing look no further:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Transpicuous News: where she rips apart the current &#x201C;news&#x201D; and decipher the bullshit</p>
</li>
<li><p>Transpicuous Views: a basic talk show type rambling dialogue, sometimes with just her ranting on and on, and sometimes with a guest or 3</p>
</li>
<li><p>The UnfuckIt Discussion: usually a very laid back open mic discussion between her and the usual &#x201C;UnFuckers&#x201D;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Common Unity: Ben Grose and Dani, usually tackling topics that surround the goal of &#x201C;community&#x201D; and &#x201C;freedom&#x201D;&#x201D;law shit.&#x201D; Dan Grose was one of the leaders of the Canadian Freemen group. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Quintessentially Whole: Ann Callaghan and Dani, discussing all aspects of health issues, and how to achieve balanced homeostasis naturally and holistically.</p>

I hooked her up with 50 steem and a delegation of 500SP to get her started.  She&#x2019;s my buddy and hoping before long she&#x2019;ll find herself highly engaged with our vibrant community and drag along thousands of extremely loyal fans that have stuck with for years.</p>
<p>Dani.  You&#x2019;re awesome and welcome home!</p>
<p>PS Dani you&#x2019;re a beneficiary on this post so you&#x2019;ll get some rewards from this post!  It&#x2019;s the least I can do and thank you for the kindness and insight you&#x2019;ve provided me over the years.  Namaste.</p>

<p>Well, it&#x2019;s that time again to write another milestone post.  I didn&#x2019;t dream that I&#x2019;d make it into the top 20 witnesses.  Frankly these guys even just in the 1 year I was here before I started my campaign were already sorta legendary to me.  I came with no crypto background, not a single friend on the platform, I was earning 7 cents in 5 posts, and I was writing about weird shit like the Mandela Effect.  What a difference a year can make.</p>
<h2 id="This-time-I&#x2019;ll-put-them-front-and-center"><a href="#This-time-I&#x2019;ll-put-them-front-and-center" class="headerlink" title="This time I&#x2019;ll put them front and center! "></a>This time I&#x2019;ll put them front and center! </h2><h2></h2><p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmaZAj93zA7okAww8ie52Azosaev4YdomzmGGfhrmenXiR/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Often times I put the whales that support me at the very back of the post.  This time it&#x2019;s at the front.  Look, the reality is that the distribution on the platform is pretty centralized.  100 accounts control 93% of the steem or more.  I wouldn&#x2019;t be in this position without whale support.  I&#x2019;m grateful for that support and am especially proud that the millionaires on this platform find value in supporting me.  I imagine a lot of that has to do with running the Minnow Support Project, which is about to cross 10k members!!! (9757 currently.  It&#x2019;ll be this week)</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmcN5DLson3TCPp33Foi5KRHmLjMLXvncdhAUWsC6voD3s/Distribution.png" alt="Distribution.png"></p>
<p>That&#x2019;s the reality&#x2026; for now.  I think as the price of steem goes up the devs that started this place will sell some off because it will represent too high a portion of their networth and we&#x2019;ll see a slightly better distribution on the platform as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="Steem-is-mooning-this-year"><a href="#Steem-is-mooning-this-year" class="headerlink" title="Steem is mooning this year! "></a>Steem is mooning this year! </h2><h2></h2><p>This market is a few weeks away from completing the correction.  It will start marching back up well past all time highs like it&#x2019;s been doing for the last many years.  When that happens zounds of people are going to pour in looking to strike it rich with crypto gold.  All of the PoS coins are going to get overloaded by the influx of people since many of them can&#x2019;t handle it now.  BTC is at max capacity.  BCH will hit it.  BCG will hit it.  LTC will hit it.  Fuck, even DOGE will hit it (we are in the Chinese year of the Doge).  Every PoS coin will be capped and over max capacity and everyone will be losing their shit.</p>
<p>Steem will be sitting here like &#x201C;Yeah, we&#x2019;re good for 2019 too!&#x201D;</p>
<h2 id="Super-bullish"><a href="#Super-bullish" class="headerlink" title="Super bullish "></a>Super bullish </h2><h2></h2><p>Many crypto experts are calling for $100k BTC by years end.  I&#x2019;m with them.  If we do nothing other than keep pace with btc we&#x2019;ll be a $50 coin.  If we outpace btc because we can scale it&#x2019;ll be larger than that.  Some folks think I&#x2019;m excessively bullish to the point of crazy.  I think we are following metcalfe&#x2019;s law as did the telephone, fax machines, and facebook.  That means we grow the user base at 100x values and grow the currency value by 10x values.  I think we&#x2019;re going to go pure huge.</p>
<h2 id="Weiss-Report"><a href="#Weiss-Report" class="headerlink" title="Weiss Report "></a><a href="http://finance.weissratings.com/crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weiss Report</a> </h2><h2></h2><p>Part of that is because the Weiss Report, which is the first crypto currency ranking system came out and ranked us higher than BTC.  We just got a B-.  BTC got a C+.  No coin got an A.  I&#x2019;m not the only one that sees how good this coin is.  </p>

<h2 id="MSP-has-a-simple-charter"><a href="#MSP-has-a-simple-charter" class="headerlink" title="MSP has a simple charter "></a>MSP has a simple charter </h2><h2></h2><p>When I realized the potential of Steem I started dedicating as much time as I could on the platform.  I hold the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty as core central values.  I created a Discord channel along with @ausbitbank, @teamsteem, and @canadian-coconut.  And after catching some resteems from @kaylinart and @fyrstikken early in my growth cycle I realized the potential of simple acts of kindness on the platform.  I started a resteem contest, put that on a new account I created called @minnowsupport and the Minnow Support Project was born.  That was a crypto eon ago in June of last year.</p>
<h2 id="MSP-has-an-amazing-team"><a href="#MSP-has-an-amazing-team" class="headerlink" title="MSP has an amazing team "></a>MSP has an amazing team </h2><h2></h2><p>The growth of the Steem blockchain is put together by many people.  This place takes all kinds of skill groups to find success.  I think the Witnesses are top notch people.  I&#x2019;m pleased that a subsection of those folks help run the Minnow Support Project and another subsection of them <a href="https://mspdelegator.herokuapp.com/mspdelegator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delegate steem to the minnowsupport project</a>.  </p>
<p>Here are witnesses that have been involved with this project and support it through various amounts of management or services to the community.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmS8VGCwzKwoVisUjBFfpDMn2xxSCDhp4ei4npQeSEanZ3/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here are the Sr. Moderators that help manage the 9700+ Steemian <a href="minnowpond.org">Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmVCH6Y2TRE158QQT9aye48WU3nBiWVw1Nr65aYvGeddmb/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And we&#x2019;re also run by a team of gifted moderators who are constantly engaged in growing the MSP and Steem community.  If you&#x2019;re wondering why you&#x2019;re not always overrun by help requests and long chats trying to figure out how Steem works then look no further.  These are the guys that are onboarding thousands of people!!!</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmWyLAJg5PwpkZ3TnHmnKzx3iV1HCnMutPUQ9bMJTqggjX/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re looking for people to support that do wonders for the Steem ecosystem than look no further to that team.</p>
<h2 id="A-special-love-shoutout-to-swelker101-and-gmuxx"><a href="#A-special-love-shoutout-to-swelker101-and-gmuxx" class="headerlink" title="A special love shoutout to @swelker101 and @gmuxx "></a>A special love shoutout to @swelker101 and @gmuxx </h2><h2></h2><p>These are two moderators that have started witness campaigns.  They are still very early in their progress.  I would encourage people to vote for them.  @swelker101 is the first moderator of the Minnow Support Project and has been a go to for stability and advice for me since I started the project.  I&#x2019;m incredibly grateful to his help.  He runs multiple Steem based radio shows on msp-waves.  He has his own discord group called <a href="https://discord.gg/V2WWEmx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnow University</a> that aims to teach people the steps they need to understand and grow within the Steem ecosystem.  And he&#x2019;s a really charming and funny guy.</p>
<p>@gmuxx was the second moderator to start at the Minnow Support Project.  He&#x2019;s one of the most active chatters on the server and has since started a second and very successful group along with @rhondak called the <a href="https://discord.gg/hcPuvDe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Writer&#x2019;s Block</a>.  If you think fiction, poetry, screenplays, and plays have a place on the Steem than I think you should consider voting for him to help his community.</p>
<h2 id="The-future-is-so-bright-here"><a href="#The-future-is-so-bright-here" class="headerlink" title="The future is so bright here! "></a>The future is so bright here! </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m incredibly grateful to this community.  I&#x2019;m excited to be a part of it.  I plan to keep all my efforts aligned to mission of the Minnow Support Project: Spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, help the Steem ecosystem grow, and train and retain new members on the platform.  Thank you for your support and thank you for your witness votes that have allowed me to delegate back to community projects and community members.</p>

More to come hopefully soon.  The project is to have a starting film studio dedicated to spreading the Steem ecosystem and values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  I&#x2019;ll start by hosting talking head shows and try to get others in there doing the same as well.  This is to say that the mission isn&#x2019;t going to change with higher Steem and SBD prices.  It&#x2019;s just going to scale higher!  Should be fun!</p>

I&#x2019;m so proud to have started this and to see it grow.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;d like to give a special shoutout to @globocop, @r0nd0n, @crimsonclad, @meno for really being the brunt force of the opps team.  @uniwhisp, @kubbyelizibeth, and @jesse2you play great roles helping it to stay organized and awesome.  And of course the DJs!!</p>

<p>TL;DR: The conversion is a good idea later when we&#x2019;re bigger.  Don&#x2019;t do it now unless the business case lands at our feet.</p>
<p>My fellow Steemians.  A great debate entangles the many brilliant minds of the Steem blockchain Witnesses and public input from the user base could greatly aid the discussion of the issue at hand.  </p>
<p>The central question posed is should we hardfork the Steem blockchain to allow Steem to be converted into SBD at a rate such that $1 dollar worth of steem creates 1 SBD.</p>
<p>On either side are good people trying to find the best pathway forward for Steem.  We all go to the same moon, and the question at hand is what is the best way to achieve that.  Underneath the question of should we hardfork the chain to do this lies the question &#x201C;is it better for the platform to have high and low SBDs or just a stable SBD near 1 USD?&#x201D;</p>
<h2 id="How-best-to-achieve-platform-growth"><a href="#How-best-to-achieve-platform-growth" class="headerlink" title="How best to achieve platform growth? "></a>How best to achieve platform growth? </h2><h2></h2><p>I believe that focusing on growth is the best thing to do.  Honestly I think both are approaches that intend to improve platform growth.  Allowing a high SBD appeals to active posters.  A stable SBD appeals to those that want to see it used as the base of commerce.  Both are meant to improve the usage and acceptance of Steem.</p>
<p>Many of the top 20 witnesses who want a stable SBD through this conversion (there are more of them than those that want a high SBD) envision SBD functioning as the next generation visa, cryptopaypal, and/or a substitute for tether.  We could even be a stable currency for a hyperinflated country.  We all envision Bittrex listing prices as BTC_SBD just like they would BTC_USDT.  This is a wonderful aspiration and we should make all efforts to get there.  To be trusted at that level we need to be at an appropriate scale.  To match even the smallest of those aims; a competitor to tether, I estimate we need roughly 1.6B SBD (the current number of tether).  </p>
<p>To support 1.6B SBD at a blockchain limit of 10% of the marketcap then we need a market cap of 16B at the barest minimum.   We as a community likely need a larger valuation before people would trust it completely because trust is diminished if we&#x2019;re at the extreme edge of our ability to support it.  It&#x2019;s possible we don&#x2019;t need to match the quantity of tether penny for penny, but the earliest I could see this working is a $10B marketcap and we would likely need higher.  We&#x2019;re currently hovering around $1B.  We&#x2019;re not at the size yet that this makes sense which is why to my knowledge no exchange, major US business, or bank like Coin Base  is knocking down our door asking us to provide a stable currency for them.  We&#x2019;re the 32nd largest coin by marketcap.  Egypt is the 32nd largest economy by GDP.  To me it&#x2019;s similar to trusting the backing of the NY stock exchange with the Egyptian Pound.  There&#x2019;s just not enough economy there to it to support it.</p>
<p>I want a high SBD because I believe it attracts active users now.  I assume people come to blog at Steem for money.  We pay them for proof of brain here.  High SBD makes their hourly salary higher and makes Steem a more attractive place to proof of brain.  Some of the pro Steem&#x2013;&gt; SBD conversion crowd doesn&#x2019;t believe this and so they don&#x2019;t follow the logic of where I take this next.  This is a fundamental assumption I&#x2019;m making: higher post rewards means more users.  I also suggest more users equals a higher valuation.  If investors are kind enough to keep high SBDs for a while then I envision we&#x2019;ll get to the necessary marketcap faster than by putting in the conversion right now.  At that point we could conceivably institute the conversion with a business case behind it (tether, coinbase, bittrex, amazon, or ebay acceptance&#x2026; something large enough to be worth giving up high sbd) and get the extreme benefit of working with one of those partners.</p>
<p>Am I against this conversion?  No, not at all.  Am I against it now?  Yes, until we&#x2019;re larger or the business case lands at our feet.</p>

<li>Code it (2 weeksish)</li>
<li>Announce it (2 weeksish)</li>
<li>Implement it</li>
<li>People start converting 1 steem for sbd at a rate of $1 worth of Steem for 1 SBD</li>

<p>What happens next is speculation:</p>
<p>Pro-Steem&#x2013;&gt;SBD Conversion:</p>
<ol>
<li>SBD is returned to $1USD very quickly</li>
<li>Businesses sprout and investment grows because SBD is a stable currency</li>
<li>The ecosystem grows because SBD is implemented as a Pegged asset in many places</li>
<li>Users come to the system because SBD is ubiquitous </li>
</ol>
<p>Con- Steem&#x2013;&gt;SBD conversion</p>
<ol>
<li>SBD tanks not only to $1 but below one with confidence destroyed after losing substantial value in 3.5 days.  This requires inflation from the witnesses and/or reverse conversion to fix.</li>
<li>Bloggers lose incentive to continue posting on the chain and the active community shrinks.</li>
<li>The amount of people using the platform can&#x2019;t support either the SBD in place and we&#x2019;re not close enough to the lowest goal out there of tether to reach the aims of the conversion in the first place.</li>
<li>Steem and SBD go down in value</li>

<li>Steem value increases as more active bloggers are on the site</li>

<h2 id="People-are-the-value"><a href="#People-are-the-value" class="headerlink" title="People are the value "></a>People are the value </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;ve stated nearly since I got here that people are the value of the currency.  Currency is proportional to goods and services and goods and services are best approximated by the number of people in a currency ecosystem.  If we want to increase the total value of the currency than the best thing to do is increase the number of people within it.  At various stages of growth what is best to attract people here may be subject to change.</p>
<h2 id="Does-a-high-SBD-increase-the-number-of-people-faster-at-this-stage-or-does-a-stable-SBD-designed-for-internet-commerce-move-it-faster"><a href="#Does-a-high-SBD-increase-the-number-of-people-faster-at-this-stage-or-does-a-stable-SBD-designed-for-internet-commerce-move-it-faster" class="headerlink" title="Does a high SBD increase the number of people faster at this stage or does a stable SBD designed for internet commerce move it faster? "></a>Does a high SBD increase the number of people faster at this stage or does a stable SBD designed for internet commerce move it faster? </h2><h2></h2><p>Right now Steem is still in it&#x2019;s infancy and the priority should be attracting users.  We have 50,000 active bloggers a day.<br> We have a handful of businesses.  90% of all the SBDs are sitting in Bittrex and Poloniex.  They don&#x2019;t appear to be used in commerce hardly at all.  I think we should focus on growing the active blogger base until it&#x2019;s large enough to have more businesses and then we can prioritize business needs appropriately.  </p>
<p>Let me pose it to you this way.  If you haven&#x2019;t started a business on Steem but you are the kind of person who might be inclined why haven&#x2019;t you done it?  Is it because SBD isn&#x2019;t stable and you are unwilling to price things in USD and then accept Steem/SBD as the medium of exchange?  Or is it because the Steem ecosystem isn&#x2019;t quite large enough and it&#x2019;s hard to figure out a business that could appeal to a wholly digital and global community of only 50,000 active users in a highly distributed geography?  Are you worried that if your company only reached 1% of the active user base you&#x2019;d only have 500 potential customers to support your business?  Or are you more worried that you&#x2019;re going to experience a 10X swing in SBD price making it a challenge to stake a business in this virtual landscape?  It&#x2019;s likely a mix&#x2026;</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur building a digital game called Steem Monsters on the platform I can tell you I&#x2019;m enthusiastic despite the fluctuation of Steem/SBD.  I accept that as part of the risk of being in crypto.  I can mitigate for now by pricing in USD.  I can share I&#x2019;m nervous about getting a return on my investment with so small a pool of users to choose from.  Speaking personally I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s price stability that&#x2019;s limiting our SBD usage so much as the number of people using our network.</p>

Since from June 1st to mid December it took our team 7 months to go from 0 members to around 4,500.  From mid-December to January we more than doubled in size to 9,500 people.</p>

<p>Here is unedited data going back to September about how we&#x2019;ve grown thanks to tracking by @discordiant.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmY58xbM5fQEWgFjUh1cpyvCjRhizWbXLqTYfPPdeyFLcH/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It is my contention that people come to Steem to earn rewards blogging.  The increase in SBD price is what is bringing them here at a faster rate than what I&#x2019;ve seen in months.</p>
<h2 id="Price-vs-Activity"><a href="#Price-vs-Activity" class="headerlink" title="Price vs Activity "></a>Price vs Activity </h2><h2></h2><p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmPvPPnLaEmSFuA2UsH4zodh59Vm2VnftqseXXtXVXRCuH/image.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I interpret these (possibly incorrectly) as highly suggesting that high prices are driving high activity (thanks @reggaemuffin for the top graph and @penguinpablo for the second graph).  The logic matches the correlation assuming active posters blog on Steem to earn money as a central motive.  Since SBD is currently responsible for 88% of post rewards (see below) I assume high SBD explains the high activity.</p>
<h2 id="Why-do-I-think-it&#x2019;s-SBD-that&#x2019;s-responsible-Let&#x2019;s-look-at-post-rewards-under-different-rules"><a href="#Why-do-I-think-it&#x2019;s-SBD-that&#x2019;s-responsible-Let&#x2019;s-look-at-post-rewards-under-different-rules" class="headerlink" title="Why do I think it&#x2019;s SBD that&#x2019;s responsible?  Let&#x2019;s look at post rewards under different rules "></a>Why do I think it&#x2019;s SBD that&#x2019;s responsible?  Let&#x2019;s look at post rewards under different rules </h2><h2></h2><p>I had a Peace Academy post payout just over a week ago.<br>The value shown on Steemit.com was 57.45<br>For my effort I was rewarded 24.131 SBD and 4.953 Steem.  Steem at the time was $4.08 and SBD was $6.38.<br>The total payout in USD was $174.16 with 88% coming from SBD and 12% coming from Steem.</p>
<p>If this proposal goes forward the point is to drive the value of SBD down to $1.  Because the amount of SBD is small and 1 steem goes a long with the conversion I don&#x2019;t expect a large spike in Steem to result in the short term.  For the same post I assume it will look like this.</p>
<p>The value shown on Steemit.com stays close to 57.45.<br>For my effort I would be rewarded 24.131 SBD and 4.953 Steem.  I estimate Steem to be $4.15 and SBD to be $1.<br>The total payout for my post would be $44.69 roughly 50% coming from Steem and 50% coming from SBD.  I estimate active bloggers have post payouts quartered.</p>
<p>For the same post to earn as much in the new system I estimate steem would have to be roughly $15USD.<br>Value on Steemit.com would show $208<br>For my effort I would be rewarded 87.36 SBD and 5.81 Steem.  I estimate Steem to be $15 and SBD to be $1.<br>The total payout for my post would be $174.72 with 50% coming from Steem and 50% coming from SBD.</p>
<p>So in my mind the pro-Steem &#x2013;&gt; SBD converters have to demonstrate how Steem will go up almost 4 times in value to justify it.  Could a large business partner do that over night?  Yes!  Do we have any lined up?  Not to my knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="Stakeholders"><a href="#Stakeholders" class="headerlink" title="Stakeholders "></a>Stakeholders </h2><h2></h2><p>I think it&#x2019;s best to answer this question by thinking through the stakeholders and how the changes are likely to effect them all.</p>
<p>Steem is made up of roughly 100 substantial investors controlling 93% of the stake.<br>Steem is made up of a dozen businesses on the chain.<br>Steem is made up of 50,000 active bloggers every day.</p>
<p>In my eyes all groups benefit by supporting and growing the active userbase with high SBD right now and when we&#x2019;re larger, have more businesses, and have a marketcap which attracts major business partners then we reevaluate.  We have a kick ass platform, a great community, fantastic devs, and a ton of highly passionate people that want to see this work.  I have faith that in cryptoland we&#x2019;re talking 2 years at most, maybe sooner until we&#x2019;re ready to implement this conversion.  Let&#x2019;s do it then!</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s in good faith to the community I represent that I present these arguments as counter points to the majority of top 20 witnesses that favor Steem &#x2013;&gt; SBD conversions now.  I highly respect my colleagues and appreciate the opportunity to add a voice to the public debate while arguing from the minority position.</p>

<p>I know this post is going to lots of Steemians, but frankly I&#x2019;m writing this specifically for my real life friends and family.  I&#x2019;ll be sharing it in an email soon.  You&#x2019;re welcome to read my letter to my family.  </p>
<h2 id="3-Sentence-Summary"><a href="#3-Sentence-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3 Sentence Summary "></a>3 Sentence Summary </h2><h2></h2><p>Consider making 10-20% of your investment portfolio cryptos and do it within the next few weeks.  Start by  putting a few hundred dollars in as a starting point as soon as possible as a way to get comfortable.  I think tidal wave two is within the next month or two so you don&#x2019;t have infinite time to doddle.</p>
<h2 id="A-note"><a href="#A-note" class="headerlink" title="A note "></a>A note </h2><h2></h2><p>The point of this is that I think this may be one of the most unprecedented buying opportunities for an investment in my lifetime and I want my friends and family to consider taking a shot at it.  There are incredible opportunities here, but it also isn&#x2019;t easy and there is risk.  Depending on your risk profile and depending on your current life status this may or may not be a good fit for <strong>you</strong>.</p>
<p>To be extremely clear this may or may not be right for everyone or all walks of life.  These are my perspectives for my family based on having been deeply involved for a year and I&#x2019;m trying to share this industry as a passionate educator because that&#x2019;s just who I am and I&#x2019;m proud to be that.  This may not be a good fit for you and your family depending on your current financial situation.  You need to take ownership of your own decisions.  I&#x2019;ll try to talk about risks, challenges, and downside as well. I&#x2019;m extremely bullish for this year, but it&#x2019;s not without risk!!!</p>
<h2 id="Hey-guys"><a href="#Hey-guys" class="headerlink" title="Hey guys "></a>Hey guys </h2><h2></h2><p>I have been in crypto for a year and a half.  I&#x2019;ve only been a real investor in this space for a few months, but I&#x2019;ve been active in a crypto community since August of 2016.  So far I think I&#x2019;ve had a pretty spectacular run.  I&#x2019;ve personally invested $5,000 into crypto and a few thousand into tech as a starting investment.  The total value of my crypto portfolio is just shy of half a million dollars and I&#x2019;ve pulled $20,000 out for expenses.  I don&#x2019;t think everyone will be able to take the same pathway I did, but there are elements to this that I think are repeatable that will still have massive financial implications.  Most of my returns have happened in the last 4 months.</p>
<p>So, my point today is to draw you into a conversation to give you a few charts and tell you a story.  Armed with some stats and knowledge that I think the story point towards an unparalleled possibility for investors.  I also think it has some real risks and isn&#x2019;t for everyone.  This is meant to inform you and implore you to explore this area.  I&#x2019;m not telling you to buy because I don&#x2019;t know your circumstances well enough to make that call.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m not sure it&#x2019;s advice&#x2026; I&#x2019;m doing my best to share why I&#x2019;m such a passionate advocate, why I have an extremely bullish outlook, and I&#x2019;ve been in sales for years.  It&#x2019;s hard for this not to sound like a pitch, but everyone has to make financial decisions for themselves. There are also risks.  While some might think technology and fraud are the biggest I actually think the biggest risk is <strong>YOU</strong> the investor.</p>
<h2 id="You&#x2019;re-the-biggest-risk"><a href="#You&#x2019;re-the-biggest-risk" class="headerlink" title="You&#x2019;re the biggest risk "></a>You&#x2019;re the biggest risk </h2><h2></h2><p>Below I&#x2019;ll go into why I&#x2019;m extremely bullish on crypto, but for just a second here&#x2019;s one of the biggest draw backs.  This place is insanely volatile, but it didn&#x2019;t work the way I thought it did.  The meteoric new highs are exuberantly fast, and the corrections are agonizingly slow.  The dot com bubble took years.  The correction took years.  Here we call that February.  I think the biggest risk is that as a new investor in the space you&#x2019;re captivated and sucked in by the highs and can&#x2019;t sell or worse buy more, and when the lows come you panic/freak out and sell low.  It might be best if you buy some and set it aside for a few years, but if you can stomach looking at the charts there&#x2019;s absolute fortunes to be made in crypto.</p>
<h2 id="Scaling-is-the-next-biggest-risk"><a href="#Scaling-is-the-next-biggest-risk" class="headerlink" title="Scaling is the next biggest risk "></a>Scaling is the next biggest risk </h2><h2></h2><p>The speed with which people are entering the market is exploding the space.  There are some options that can scale now that I&#x2019;ll talk about later, but some of the major coins are already at max technical capacity (for right this moment).  I think there&#x2019;s a real chance some of the coins won&#x2019;t keep up with the growth.  Mitigating that risk while the space grows is an absolute challenge.  With that growth so comes new devs.  I&#x2019;m hopeful if we through enough code monkeys working on the the problems they&#x2019;ll get it right, but there&#x2019;s a risk that some coins and chains will outright fail under the weight of growth.</p>
<h2 id="Fraud"><a href="#Fraud" class="headerlink" title="Fraud "></a>Fraud </h2><h2></h2><p>Crypto is still the wild west.  It&#x2019;s intentionally hard to regulate.  You can&#x2019;t rely on a central authority to necessarily save you if you&#x2019;re cheated.  I recently lost $2,000 on a coin that pulled the plug.  That happens.  I think standard discernment is important and you&#x2019;re gonna have to sniff out bullshit just like any other market where people to try to make a buck.  That said the safety net isn&#x2019;t here to the same extent.  So, you have to take full ownership of the choices you make.</p>
<h2 id="Where-you-are-in-life"><a href="#Where-you-are-in-life" class="headerlink" title="Where you are in life "></a>Where you are in life </h2><h2></h2><p>Markets can stay in downturns longer than you can stay afloat.  I think we&#x2019;re going to see 10X returns this year on the major coins and 100X or more on many of the alt-coins.  That said there&#x2019;s a good chance you&#x2019;re not going to time the market perfectly and that they&#x2019;ll go down before they go up.  Stocks might dip 5%.  Crypto calls that Tuesday morning.  This correction is a 35% dip right now off of highs and probably has one more lower low to go before it springs back up.  </p>
<p>We are at 12k btc today.  I think it&#x2019;ll hit 15ish and then hit 8k before bouncing back up hard.  If you don&#x2019;t ladder in at the right time you could see a drop before you see a rise.  Don&#x2019;t invest any money that you might need to get back quickly because it could force you sell at a really shitty market time.</p>
<h2 id="Those-are-real-risks-here-are-the-rewards"><a href="#Those-are-real-risks-here-are-the-rewards" class="headerlink" title="Those are real risks, here are the rewards "></a>Those are real risks, here are the rewards </h2><h2></h2><p>Here are thoughts on why I think crypto is an amazing opportunity for me and my family.  I welcome and encourage you to wrap that up into a lot of other perspectives before you actually do anything.  I do think we have a fairly narrow time to get into one of the biggest tidal waves of investment.  You missed out on block chain tech reaching what I&#x2019;ll call level 1.  We&#x2019;ll still be here for level 2 and 3.  This is about how comfortable you are taking risks, which usually is how well you understand something.  I&#x2019;m here to educate you so you can make an educated chioce on what you want to do with your investment portfolio.  </p>
<p>Again, take ownership of your own finances and see if this is a good fit.  I&#x2019;m not a registered financial guy.  I don&#x2019;t know if this is a good fit for you and if the risk profile is going to be worth the upside potential.  It&#x2019;s there for me, but you have to find out if it is for you.</p>
<h2 id="Cryptocurrencies-and-block-chain-technology-are-going-to-explode"><a href="#Cryptocurrencies-and-block-chain-technology-are-going-to-explode" class="headerlink" title="Cryptocurrencies and block chain technology are going to explode "></a>Cryptocurrencies and block chain technology are going to explode </h2><h2></h2><p>A year ago people would say $20,000 per bitcoin is unimaginable.  A year from now we&#x2019;ll be dreaming of how inexpensive that looks.  In my vision of the future every website has a checkout option of credit card, paypal, and crypto.  You can&#x2019;t do this just yet, but it&#x2019;s not long into the future before I can pay my mortgage, utilities, and lunch with crypto currencies.  I&#x2019;ll buy my next house with it.  We&#x2019;re going to mainstream so hard it&#x2019;ll cause whiplash.  In the process a tsunami of money is going to enter into the space and it&#x2019;ll make people who are early investors very wealthy.  </p>
<p>I think the early investor bus is going to leave the station soon.  There will continue to be great opportunities, but I think what we are going to see this year will be unprecedented&#x2026; even for cryptos!</p>
<h2 id="What-is-a-cryptocurrency-and-what-is-block-chain"><a href="#What-is-a-cryptocurrency-and-what-is-block-chain" class="headerlink" title="What is a cryptocurrency and what is block chain "></a>What is a cryptocurrency and what is block chain </h2><h2></h2><p>These are two words that describe the same thing.  These terms are describing public ledgers that record all the data and share it across a wide list of people.  <code>Aggroed sends 15 sbd to ausbitbank.</code>  <code>Mary sends 10 steem to Jim.</code>  Those are transactions that are stored in a big file and that file keeps growing.  Every chain is different but on steem we wait three seconds and take a snapshot of the new transactions and store that into a new chunk of data saved as a &#x201C;block&#x201D; and then those blocks are hooked into the chain ready for the next block.</p>
<p>One way to think of this is create an excel file.  Rather than saving the whole file every 3 seconds simply save what changes were made over the last 3 seconds.  Those changes files should then be small.  If you play those files back in a row like a movie you can see how the excel file changed over time and get caught up.  That&#x2019;s essentially what block chain tech is.</p>
<p><code>Cryptocurrency</code> describes the same thing, but puts the emphasis on a different aspect of how it all works.  At first I thought crypto was meaning something sinister when I first landed here, but it really just refers to the algorithm of how blocks are created and stored.  What you want is trust that the data is true and no can modify them.  If I can make a block or change a block to randomly say <code>aggroed recieves 10,000,000 SBD</code> then the whole thing will have a lot of problems.  So, to fight that programmers included cryptography into the tools so that bad actors were thwarted.  </p>
<h2 id="People-are-flocking-to-blockchains"><a href="#People-are-flocking-to-blockchains" class="headerlink" title="People are flocking to blockchains! "></a>People are flocking to blockchains! </h2><h2></h2><p>When bitcoin hit $20,000 per bitcoin there were reports of crypto exchanges, places where you can exchange one crypto for another (like a stock exchange) and sometimes for fiat curencies, signing up 100,000 people per day!  The next wave of investor, adopter, and developer is coming here right now in a tidal wave.  JPM has it&#x2019;s own chain.  The banks put together Ripple as a group chain.  Institutional money is already entering the space, but it&#x2019;s not long before pension funds are taking a position as a standard operating procedure.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s slowed down some since there has been a price correction, but the funny thing about corrections is that it gives people an opportunity to buy in and in many ways we&#x2019;re expanding our base through the correction.  Let&#x2019;s talk about why that matters.</p>
<h2 id="What-gives-currency-value"><a href="#What-gives-currency-value" class="headerlink" title="What gives currency value? "></a>What gives currency value? </h2><h2></h2><p>8 months ago I put out an <a href="https://steemit.com/witness/@aggroed/witness-run-my-outline-of-the-economics-of-the-system-what-to-do-to-keep-the-sbd-peg-at-usd1usd-and-why-we-should" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economics post</a>.  That was at the very start of my witness campaign.  Folks ended up electing me on the Steem blockchain to help build this blockchain, which I do through a server that I run!  The main thrust of that paper and what I&#x2019;m discussing today is that the value of a currency is the number of people using and accepting that currency.  Here&#x2019;s how I get there.  (For savvy readers there&#x2019;s some stuff about SBDs I&#x2019;ve changed some of my views on since I first started this, but that&#x2019;s secondary to the info on big picture economics which haven&#x2019;t changed).</p>
<p><code>Value of the currency is proportional to all the goods and services</code>  this kind of thing is straight out of a textbook</p>
<p>Figuring out goods and services in an economy is really freaking hard.  Figuring it out in a decentralized economy tied to other decentralized economies in a global manner is basically impossible.</p>
<p>A really good proxy for all that trade though is the number of people in the economy.  People is much easier to calculate and estimate.  I also trust it since it&#x2019;s people are doing the buying, selling, manufacturing, and services.  Number of people are a really good approximation for amount of goods and services in an economy.  Yes if I&#x2019;m comparing a highly industrialized nation to an impoverished agricultural country it&#x2019;s not a perfect tool, but cryptos are a global phenomenon and thus that should mostly level out.</p>
<p><code>Value of the currency is proportional to the number of people in the economy</code></p>
<h2 id="PEOPLE-ARE-THE-VALUE"><a href="#PEOPLE-ARE-THE-VALUE" class="headerlink" title="PEOPLE ARE THE VALUE!!! "></a>PEOPLE ARE THE VALUE!!! </h2><h2></h2><p>So, if people are the value and we&#x2019;re seeing them sign up in droves that gives me a lot of faith that we&#x2019;re going to sky rocket as an industry.  There&#x2019;s an economics &#x201C;law&#x201D; that also indicates this.  The law defines it more mathematically than I have.  It&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/bitcoin-mayer-multiple/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metcalfe&#x2019;s law</a> and has shown to work for fax machines, telephones, and facebook.  It states the the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of people in the network.  Here&#x2019;s a chart of bitcoin moving along the anticipated pace dictated by Metcalfe&#x2019;s law.  That little regression number up in the top left shows for the tracked portion of this graph that there is a 98%+ correlation to the value of bitcoin to Metcalfe&#x2019;s law.  We&#x2019;re still right on track.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmUMCMYNMoqja8pzC1QLH4qMcMc2uFPeAfb46F8GWAGavJ/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>People are the value.  PEOPLE ARE THE VALUE!!! People are coming in droves.  The value is going to increase by a metric fuckton!!!!</p>
<h2 id="Why-do-people-want-cryptocurrencies"><a href="#Why-do-people-want-cryptocurrencies" class="headerlink" title="Why do people want cryptocurrencies? "></a>Why do people want cryptocurrencies? </h2><h2></h2><p>The trick is not to look at this in isolation, but looking at it from the perspective of what&#x2019;s the delta between the options?</p>
<p>If we&#x2019;re considering government issued currencies then cryptocurrencies have a huge number of advantages.  For starters let&#x2019;s look at the Federal Reserve, which is a private bank whose leaders have gone on record before Congress stating they are above the law and who operate the current money system.  They print $160MUSD a day right now.  During the financial crisis in 2008 they printed $16T and handed it out to banks and actually mostly foreign banks.  Since the central bank has started our nation&#x2019;s money has lost 99% of it&#x2019;s value.  As a result of these economic conditions if you have $10,000 in a bank account today you will be able to purchase fewer goods and services with it next year because it will continue to decline in value.  Cash since the inception of the Federal Reserve has been a horrible store of wealth.</p>
<p>Other options exist too.  You can buy stocks, commodities, and real estate, but it&#x2019;s hard to find good deals.  Much of these markets are extremely manipulated.  The libor scandel showed basically trillions of dollars in loans were manipulated by all of the major banks acting in collusion.  High Frequency Trading has showed that financial firms are manipulating prices before you&#x2019;re able to get them.  Real estate is going ballistic, but a lot of it appears to be driven by overseas investors using the properties as a way to launder money out of the country and it&#x2019;s creating unrealistic prices for properties.  </p>
<p><strong>Essentially people buying cryptos are looking at other options and ultimately deciding that they aren&#x2019;t trustworthy investments and we&#x2019;ll see that they under perform cryptos on top of that.</strong></p>
<h2 id="So-what&#x2019;s-good-about-a-crypto"><a href="#So-what&#x2019;s-good-about-a-crypto" class="headerlink" title="So, what&#x2019;s good about a crypto?  "></a>So, what&#x2019;s good about a crypto?  </h2><h2></h2><p>Clear and transparent rules about how the blockchain operates.  The software is opensource.  That&#x2019;s one of the reasons so many people can create new chains (there are over 700 cryptocurrencies now), but it&#x2019;s also a major reason why people trust it.  You can go onto a public code repository, download software, check out the software, possibly add changes to the public software if you&#x2019;re inclined, and then run the wallet, miner, or program and trust it&#x2019;s the same thing everyone else is using with the same rules as everyone else.</p>
<p>Devs from all over the world will look at the code and make sure it&#x2019;s doing what the various white papers, a document describing how they function, say it&#x2019;s going to do.  The code for the currencies can be checked for truthfulness.  The amount of fraud for the blockchain code itself is incredibly low because the code is publicly scrutinized and the algorithms are designed to stop any kind of theft or hijacking.  </p>
<p>There&#x2019;s no central authority that can just print 16T more tokens on a day without an act of congress.  The amount of coins in cirucation and the printing authority is distributed.  The threat of individuals inflating the coin at the expense of everyone else outside of the pre-set rules of the game is practically non-existant.</p>
<h2 id="Releasing-new-coins-and-rules-of-the-game"><a href="#Releasing-new-coins-and-rules-of-the-game" class="headerlink" title="Releasing new coins and rules of the game "></a>Releasing new coins and rules of the game </h2><h2></h2><p>Blockchains have a set schedules for how they release new coins and to whom.  This is mostly commonly done by mining.  People purchase equipment to solve a complicated math problem and if they are the ones to solve it coins are released to them.  How many coins and the rate of inflation can be determined by the rules in the code for the blockchain.  So everyone knows how much is coming and when.</p>
<p><strong>The benefit to this system is that no central authority can up and decide to print 16T tokens cause (insert selfish rational here)!!!</strong></p>
<p>You know the schedule, all the users agree on the schedule, no one has a right to print more (unless it&#x2019;s in the rules), and it&#x2019;s up to the rules of the blockchain to distribute them.  The power of money creation is no longer isolated into the hands of greedy bankers, but now decentralized to everyone in the world that wants to run the programs!</p>
<h2 id="The-power-of-deflation"><a href="#The-power-of-deflation" class="headerlink" title="The power of deflation "></a>The power of deflation </h2><h2></h2><p>While many of the cryptocurrencies are technically inflationary the number of coins created is so small relative to what government fiat (&#x201C;fiat&#x201D; described below) currencies choose to mint that they are essentially deflationary.  Most of the currency wars in government fiat are a race to who can print the most!  Most of the currency wars in cryptoland are who has the least inflation!</p>
<p>Part of the reason the coins gain so much value is that deflationary currencies tend to go up in value.  That&#x2019;s a self fulfilling prophecy too, but ultimately if you know you can buy more goods and services with a currency if you have it and sit on it for a year then you are inclined to own and keep it.  It keeps supply lower, which increases price.  Practically all the cryptocurrencies are deflationary compared to government money and so they are highly attractive when comparing basically any crypto to any government &#x201C;fiat&#x201D; currency.</p>
<p>(Fiat generally implies that it&#x2019;s backed by nothing.  The USD was on the gold standard up until the 70s when Nixon Nixxed it.  Until then you could take money to a bank and exchange it for gold.  It was gold backed.  Now you can&#x2019;t make that exchange. Since on paper it isn&#x2019;t backed by any asset anymore it&#x2019;s called fiat.  What gives it value?  The number of people in the world that accept it as a medium of exchange, and it&#x2019;s defacto backed by petroluem and the US military.)</p>
<h2 id="Borders"><a href="#Borders" class="headerlink" title="Borders "></a>Borders </h2><h2></h2><p>Crypto is international in scope.  People in every single country use it.  I can choose to send currency to any single person on the planet.  I click some buttons and boom.  Value is sent.  Some cryptos take a few hours to clear.  Some take a few seconds.  It&#x2019;s drastically faster than modern banking software, and many coins have eliminated fees and middlemen.  I also don&#x2019;t have to check in with a central authority to do this.  I&#x2019;m not waiting for someone else to approve my transaction.  If I want to trade I do it.  Many people are attracted to how liberating that is.</p>
<h2 id="Security"><a href="#Security" class="headerlink" title="Security "></a>Security </h2><h2></h2><p>If you don&#x2019;t own the keys it isn&#x2019;t yours.  With cryptos you get a set of keys.  The world saw in cyprus how banks can give accounts a hair cut and do &#x201C;bail ins&#x201D; and set negative interest rates and a million other things to steal your money.  If they don&#x2019;t have the keys they can&#x2019;t take what&#x2019;s yours!  (You can lose keys and lose money.  Exchanges also don&#x2019;t give you keys and may get hacked so there&#x2019;s risk there too.)</p>
<h2 id="It&#x2019;s-the-delta"><a href="#It&#x2019;s-the-delta" class="headerlink" title="It&#x2019;s the delta! "></a>It&#x2019;s the delta! </h2><h2></h2><p>USD- slow to move, highly inflationary, privately controlled, privately issued.<br>Crypto- instant to hours to move, deflationary, publicly controlled, opensource, publicly issued, decentralized</p>
<h2 id="Why-now"><a href="#Why-now" class="headerlink" title="Why now? "></a>Why now? </h2><h2></h2><p>Cryptocurrency trading is highly volatile and mounds of money are moving around.  For a stock trader used to 10-15% as big changes in a year it&#x2019;s hard to comprehend the violent 80% swings that bitcoin has gone through or the 10-150X swings that the alt-coins have gone through (there are over 700 cryptocurrencies now.  Bitcoin is the main one that still has 30% market share, but many other coins exist collectively known as alt-coins).</p>
<p>Bitcoin is currently correcting from the first major wave of unprecedented investment.  When that correction completes I believe, but can&#x2019;t prove that we are likely on another metioric rise that puts the 20k btc to shame and leaves everyone shaking their head.  Everyone shaking their heads except for the people who have been in crypto for a while and know it&#x2019;s coming.</p>

<p> A 40 min interview with a well informed skeptic.</p>
<h2 id="Criteria-for-picking-winners-and-a-good-portfolio"><a href="#Criteria-for-picking-winners-and-a-good-portfolio" class="headerlink" title="Criteria for picking winners and a good portfolio "></a>Criteria for picking winners and a good portfolio </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m not advocating that you take all your money and put it into crypto.  That&#x2019;s actually pretty dangerous.  I am suggesting that you have a balanced portfolio and consider crypto another asset class to put in it.  Own cash, stock, real estate and crypto.  I think crypto should be 10-20% of many people&#x2019;s savings and investments.  This may be higher if you&#x2019;re young and have a safety net of some sort.</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t think you can reallly go wrong picking bitcoin or ethereum.  I think they are trusted and proven assets that large investors will purchase and hold.  I think they make good investments, but I don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;ll be the final winners, but as far as crypto goes they are probably the safest investments.</p>
<h2 id="Scaling-is-the-future"><a href="#Scaling-is-the-future" class="headerlink" title="Scaling is the future "></a>Scaling is the future </h2><h2></h2><p>I think and it was nice to hear that billionaire reaffirm this thought that the biggest issue is going to be scaling.  Lemme use some round numbers.  I think within the next 9-15 months we&#x2019;re going to reach $100k btc.  That puts bitcoin at a valuation worth 1/4 of the value of gold as a store of wealth.  That doesn&#x2019;t seem unreal to me.  In order to get there we have to go from bitcoin around $10k to bitcoin around $100k.  That&#x2019;s a 10X change, and according to Metcalfe&#x2019;s law which I think there&#x2019;s evidence we&#x2019;re following that means we have to grow by 10^2 or 100x people in the network.  What that means is that I need a chain that can scale and it has to be able to scale in 2018.</p>
<p>There are going to be more winners than what I&#x2019;m going to put here, but I&#x2019;m invested in and think highly of a class of coin&#x2019;s I like to call &#x201C;Dan Coins.&#x201D;  These are all coins built by a guy by the name of Dan Larimer who&#x2019;s a freaking programming genius and has a team of really freaking good devs (some of whom I&#x2019;ve worked with personally).</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s a website called blocktivity.info.  It tracks the current value of a coin, which is generally thought of as the market cap and can be determined by looking at the total coins and multiplying by the value of each one.  Then it looks at how much activity is on the block and how many transactions it can handle.  Lasty it makes a ratio of block activity versus marketcap, normalizes it to a value of 1 for bitcoin and then starts comparing coins.  High values are undervalued.  Low numbers are overvalued.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQma4mw1TdRNUkNk7HEZRMjCE3FWdS7NFEouSw3F3tDTHPf/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>All the coins that can scale are Dan coins.  These are powered by a blockchain methodology call DPoS or Delegated Proof of Stake.  They are lightening fast, scale exceptionally well, have zero or near zero fees, and use almost zero electricity (unlike Proof of Work, PoS, coins that use 20% of world electricity). </p>
<p>I think I&#x2019;d include cardano in here too that is using a hybrid approach.</p>
<p>So I like Steem, BTS, EOS, and Cardano for 2018.  There&#x2019;s others&#x2026; but as a class I like DPoS coins.</p>

<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://i.imgur.com/w2vop5U.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I think value is proportional to people, and I see herds of people joining.  It&#x2019;s not just my group or steem.  This is a global tide of people moving towards decentralized cryptocurrencies to solve whatever they can think to solve this way.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion "></a>Conclusion </h2><h2></h2><p>Crypto has amazing opportunities.  You need to get informed and then consider it having a home in your portfolio.  You probably can&#x2019;t go wrong with Ethereum and bitcoin, but I think the future is in DPoS coins and second generation technologies that can scale.  There are more than I have mentioned, but those are ones I&#x2019;m confidant in.</p>
<p>This space is risky and extremely volitile.  It&#x2019;s not a good fit for everyone.  I have money to invest and I&#x2019;m comfortable in this space.  I have more than 20% of my assets in here, and I&#x2019;m not sure I can recommend that.  However, crypto is an expanding space and an unparalled global tidal wave.  Please consider what I&#x2019;ve shared as you take ownership of your own investments and consider choosing on your own to make an investment into crypto.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: The point is to educate yourself, take a baby nibble to try it out, and then make up your own mind with your own due diligence to figure out what to do.<br><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmcJXHaRQYoTU1X41cFTVKyMS39AMnb8jH754tN7es9Y9j/image.png" alt=""></p>
