src="https://s16.postimg.org/g6mswpds5/home_health_care.jpg" width="715" height="447"></p><br><p>OK, so out comes a woman who resembles Clinton at 50 rather than her actual age of 68. &#xA0;Home Health care or not it&#x2019;s extremely unlikely that Clinton would suffer medical issues and then emerge 4 hours later from Chelseas appartment or home health care clinic looking 10 years younger, 50lbs lighter, and speaking with a voice that doesn&#x2019;t stress from pnuemonia-like symptoms. &#xA0;I made a <a

rel="noopener">post</a> about it.</p><br><p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CsKo7auXYAAJeot.jpg:large" width="650" height="463"></p><br><p>People also note the distinct lack of standard security detail around her after she appears.</p><br><p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CsJuNj7UIAAz5jU.jpg" width="1200" height="675"></p><br><p>Anyway, she went to her <a

href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/3469038/posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chappequa, NY</a>. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s noteworthy that the whole place is apparently guarded like a fortress right now.</p><br><p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/09/13/19/384227C900000578-3787654-image-a-12_1473792883625.jpg"></p><br><p><a

href="https://twitter.com/DougNBC/status/775322512968253440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancelled </a>her CA funding trip, and her Ohio<a href="https://twitter.com/whiotv/status/775329119169024000" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> appearances were taken</a> by Chelsea.</p><br><p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CsKcM4eUEAAYLoQ.jpg"

rel="noopener">tomorrow</a>. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll see.</p><br><p><br></p><br><p>Anyway, she calls into Anderson Cooper after she gets out of the <del>home hospital complex </del>apartment. &#xA0;Now it actually makes sense that she might just call in after being sick and passing out. &#xA0;That&#x2019;s cool, what doesn&#x2019;t make sense is that she makes it through 10 minutes of interview with Anderson without coughing once. &#xA0;That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m introducing the thought that she used a voice double. &#xA0;Listen to how crisp she sounds in the video and tell me that&#x2019;s the same woman seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsGUSdhHIt8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spitting out green chunks</a> of whatever while hacking and not getting through 30 seconds of a speech without drinking water, begging the audience for forgiveness for the coughing disruption, and sounding incredibly horse.</p><br><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhn7M_7ZZZs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhn7M_7ZZZs</a></p><br><p>The campaign says she didn&#x2019;t see a doctor until she got to Chappequa, but I&#x2019;m suspicious. &#xA0;Here&#x2019;s the video where they talk about the move.</p><br><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaLlcdbn1Hg" target="_blank"

&#xA0;It&#x2019;s a classic case of deceiver&#x2019;s delight. &#xA0;You can see that here at around 50 seconds very clearly. &#xA0;See if they match for you too.</p><br><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GutAbsKWLsY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GutAbsKWLsY</a></p><br><p><br></p><br><p>Anyway. &#xA0;Those are some of the least weird things to come out. &#xA0;The most weird are multiple claims by ABC news that she&#x2019;s already dead. &#xA0;The official announcements came out it was allergies, then dehydration, and then officially disclosed pnuemonia. &#xA0;Others have said she has symptoms of pneumonia, Parkinsons, and Dementia. &#xA0;I linked those three illnesses together with some other symptoms as tertiary syphilis <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@aggroed/medical-conjecture-secretary-clinton-likely-suffers-from-late-stage-syphilis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. &#xA0;But over the past two days people have caught screen shots and recordings of ABC posting that she died.</p><br><p>ABC news reports she died at a hospital-</p><br><p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CsQtEU2WYAAZ_JP.jpg:large" width="1024" height="576"></p><br><p>It was also reported on WABC7- You know ABC! &#xA0;The giant TV channel.</p><br><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=jLrc-YAdoQo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=jLrc-YAdoQo</a></p><br><p>ABC was contacted by Alex Jones and they shared that it was real footage, but an accident and not true. &#xA0;I could believe that for 1 piece of news, but not two from the same outfit. &#xA0;Don&#x2019;t get me wrong&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;s necessarily dead. &#xA0;I think it&#x2019;s possible she is, but I also think it&#x2019;s a way to fake her death too so that she doesn&#x2019;t have to face justice for the war crimes, civil crimes, and heinous deeds she&#x2019;s committed over an extended public political career as well as an extended shady private career at the Clinton Foundation.</p><br><p>The <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-09-12/hillary-clintons-campaign-needs-hire-better-liars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real conspiracy</a> here is that there&#x2019;s nothing wrong with her.</p><br><p><br></p><br><p>Anyway, if you don&#x2019;t think something is up then just stay calm. &#xA0;She has <del>pnuemonia</del> the flu and will be back tomorrow.</p><br><p><a

&#xA0;I just want to remind everyone that I have no intention of dying anytime soon. &#xA0;We&#x2019;re all in perfect health right now. &#xA0;No one is suicidal. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m in a loving happy

The Mandela Effect is when there is a difference between the memories of groups of people and recorded history for simple things like movie quotes and titles of books/movies or spellings of words. The Toto effect is when people remember more tangible things being different like History, Religion, Geography, and physical products very differently than recorded history. You may find that when you can look at a series of examples that the world around you is very different than you remember.&#xA0;</p><br><p>Here&#x2019;s the short quiz: <a href="http://www.quiz-maker.com/QYN1BOG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.quiz-maker.com/QYN1BOG</a>&#xA0;</p><br><p>Here&#x2019;s a quiz used in a scientific study: <a href="http://www.quiz-maker.com/QRVR3A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.quiz-maker.com/QRVR3A</a>&#xA0;</p><br><p>Here&#x2019;s the quiz that covers the most topics: <a href="http://www.quiz-maker.com/Q6G9ZLT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.quiz-maker.com/Q6G9ZLT</a> Will you please take one or more of these quizzes?&#xA0;</p><br><p>If you are interested in the results of the scientific study the written notes are available here: <a href="http://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/lmhstore/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/14142037/Mandela-effect-25000-response-Final-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/lmhstore/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/14142037/Mandela-effect-25000-response-Final-1.pdf</a> and a youtube summary is available here:</p><br><p>&#xA0;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe65g0K8ePc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe65g0K8ePc</a> &#xA0;</p><br>

She&#x2019;s never going to recover from this.&#x201D; &#xA0;He looks smug. &#xA0;&#x201D;Get it, recover from this, both in the polls and from the illness. &#xA0;She&#x2019;s so fucked! &#xA0;It&#x2019;s great.&#x201D; &#xA0;He says.</p><br><p><img src="https://s16.postimg.org/d4bxwmpmd/stretcher.jpg" width="536" height="598"></p><br><p>Again after I ask him if he&#x2019;s willing to talk about peaceful and diplomatic solutions to the proxy war that appears to be playing out in Syria between various factions fighting on behalf of what looks like the Russians and the United States he brushes me off. &#xA0;&#x201D;Look, we can talk about that stuff after the election. &#xA0;Until then we have to win the election. &#xA0;This meme is definitely going to do it!&#x201D;</p><br><p><img src="https://s16.postimg.org/mm73ixlx1/frankenstein.jpg" width="582" height="445"></p><br><p>The Donald begins laughing pretty hard at this point. &#xA0;&#x201D;I know I shouldn&#x2019;t be spreading things like this, but come on. &#xA0;The entire intelligence community knows that she sent out a double. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m still trying to figure out if the scene that played out was an arrest and if the footage aired by ABC announcing her death was legitimate. &#xA0;Oh, look what I found here.&#x201D;</p><br><p><img src="https://s16.postimg.org/wi86ikrp1/double.jpg" width="461" height="519"></p><br><p>&#x201C;Look at her. &#xA0;She looks 50. &#xA0;She&#x2019;s 68. &#xA0;I wouldn&#x2019;t want to date her now. &#xA0;America doesn&#x2019;t want an unsexy woman as President. &#xA0;I mean Palin was hot enough to pull it off, but her, no way. &#xA0;And I don&#x2019;t know any pneumonia treatment that takes off 50 lbs overnight. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s simple. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s done. &#xA0;She used a double.&#x201D;</p><br><p>I tried to ask more questions, but he shooed me away. &#xA0;Looks like if we want real answers to petty questions it&#x2019;s faster just to message him on Twitter.</p><br>
