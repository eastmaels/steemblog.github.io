<p>This is cryptopunk.  It&#x2019;s like steampunk or dieselpunk.  It depicts a different kind of life.  This one is scifi based.  You have the freedom loving people of Nagan VII and the bureaucratic Kartouri who seek to rule them.  </p>
<p>Up until now Tanic, the ships captain of the Karouri Peace Enforcers, has attacked the people of Nagan VII at least twice, he was hit with an illegal quantum slider and sent to a different dimension and had to work his way back over the course of more than a year.  He went back with more ships seeking vengence against Nagan VII and particularly Admiral Santana, but got all blowed up.  He&#x2019;s about to wake up after a concussion in Santana&#x2019;s living room where he&#x2019;s now a guest.</p>
<hr>
<p>Chapter 2.  First Flag</p>
<p>Tanic woke up and immediately regretted it.  His head was splitting.  He put his hands to his face and felt some bandages and pain.  Seems like he was out on a 3 week straight binger.  Then the swelling and the pulsing in his head.  It hurt.  A lot.  Then he realized he had no idea where he was.  As he looked around it appeared to be a living room, and he was on a fold out couch turned into a bed.  The house was relatively small and as he looked outside he could see some farmland.</p>
<p>He sat up in bed.  He immediately regretted it.  His head felt like a smashed watermelon.  He took a pause to let his brain recalibrate.  There was a techtab on the table with a note from Santana.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, I hope you&#x2019;re ok, sorry your ships got all blowed up, we&#x2019;re working on fixing them minus the weapons.  It&#x2019;s gonna be a bit.  No one really wants to support the people that just attacked us, but I&#x2019;ll get you home.  In the meantime you can login to libertynet.gov where I&#x2019;ve made you the account Kart.Tanic.  It has some script in it too so if you go to town or something you can get what you need.  I don&#x2019;t have any men&#x2019;s clothing since my husband died and I got rid of all his stuff so you&#x2019;re stuck in the uniform for now unless you want a muumuu.  I&#x2019;m heading into town.  I&#x2019;ll be back with dinner.  Please don&#x2019;t do anything dumb if you wake up before I get back.  </p>
<p>PS after I created you account I left a very brief post as your introduction &lt;3 Santana.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He flicked it aside.  Fuck her, I&#x2019;m gonna strangle her with my bare hands.  </p>
<p>He stood up and felt woozy, but fought through it.  He walked into the kitchen and found a knife and a piece of bread and an apple.  He ate the apple, put the bread in his pocket and walked outside with the knife in his hand.  </p>
<p>Santana lived on a small homestead over an hour outside of Nagnarok.  It was a nice plantation that help a variety of animals and vegetables, rain water collection, and even LENR power.  He could use the tech tab to communicate, but he was sure it was all being watched.  So, he headed down the road looking for someone.  As it turns out he found a group of kids walking his way.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hey, Hey you kids.  Come here!&#x201D;  </p>
<p>The kids saw a half crazed man with a bandage on his head weilding a knife asking for the kids to come over.  They did what sensible kids would do and they ran.  Tanic took two steps to follow them, and immediately regretted it.  He put his hand on his head and sat down from the pain.  A minute or two later he got up and started walking down the road again.  This time a farmer with a few kids got out of an air cruiser (a hover car) and approached him weapon raised.  &#x201C;I think you were talking to my boys in a most unfriendly way sir?  You ok?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic saw the gun and knew he had a chance to get a weapon.  So, he put the knife behind is back and walked slowly toward the man saying &#x201C;Look friend, I&#x2019;m sorry about your boys,  I was just having a little fun.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The farmer said &#x201C;Sir, I know you have the knife, please stop.  Put it down and let&#x2019;s talk about how to get you well son.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic ignored him and pressed on &#x201C;Look sir, I&#x2019;m just looking for a way into town, I seem to have had a little trouble and now I just need to contact some of my friends and settle all of this.&#x201D;  He took another step and was now pretty close to the farmer so he lunged with the knife, he immediately regretted it.  Before he got anywhere he felt 10k joules shooting through him.  He hit the ground writhing in agony, and passed out.</p>
<hr>
<p>He woke up some time later with the tech tab on his chest with a note from Santana.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#x2019;m in the garden.  Seriously, please don&#x2019;t do anything stupid.  Just log into the tech tab and try not to do anything violent today.  I&#x2019;ll have some food and water for you soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He opened up the techtab.  Logged in as Kart.Tanic on libertynet.gov.  Santana&#x2019;s first post for him read-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi, I&#x2019;m Tanic.  I just attacked your planet.  I&#x2019;m from the Kartouri.  I&#x2019;m going to be staying with Santana for a while as my ship is being fixed.  I&#x2019;ll talk to you soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the replies were just automatic spambots and welcome bots for a variety of groups.  One or two people said hi.  A few had some insults for having attacked him.  What really bothered him though was that one vote came in red and appeared to be a flag.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From FarmerMike<br>This dude&#x2019;s a dick.  Not only tried to bomb our planet but also threatened my kids with a knife.  What a tool.  Next time don&#x2019;t come at a man with a loaded rifle.  Next time I&#x2019;ll use shots and not volts.  Enjoy your first flag asshole.</p>

<h2 id="Previous-episode-https-steemit-com-cryptopunk-aggroed-nagan-7-episode-8-a-new-home"><a href="#Previous-episode-https-steemit-com-cryptopunk-aggroed-nagan-7-episode-8-a-new-home" class="headerlink" title="Previous episode- https://steemit.com/cryptopunk/@aggroed/nagan-7-episode-8-a-new-home"></a>Previous episode- <a href="https://steemit.com/cryptopunk/@aggroed/nagan-7-episode-8-a-new-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/cryptopunk/@aggroed/nagan-7-episode-8-a-new-home</a></h2><p>Muxxy and Welk were like two little school boys watching the fire works display.  &#x201C;Operation Excessive Fuckery&#x201D; worked perfectly.  Santana was pleased too.  They used Netuoso&#x2019;s hacking skills to overwrite the targetting system.  When the Karts made their violent intentions clear they activated the program and took over the targetting system.  In truth only two ships were out there.  Santana in Baby-4 and Mystique sailing the Discordiant.  All the other targets were weapons systems, engine systems, and other critical systems on the the Dreadnaughts.  Neither Mystique or Santana fired a shot.  The peace enforcers blew the shit out of each other.</p>
<p>Now for the rescue operation.  It hadn&#x2019;t been planned this way, but two of the Dreadnaught raider bitches actually shut down life support on one another.  Seems like the Kartouri put their engines a little too close to the circulation systems.  The couple holes they poked in the ships hull maybe led to a few deaths, but if they didn&#x2019;t get over there and patch life support or life boat everyone there was gonna be some blood on their hands.</p>
<p>Sammo?  You ready to launch?</p>
<p>&#x201C;Maam I&#x2019;m always ready to launch!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sammo, the newly hired ship&#x2019;s engineer released the docking clamps and shot out of the launch bay.  Muxxy, Welk, and Santana along with a skeleton crew flashed across the deep space horizon shooting towards Tanic&#x2019;s &#x201C;capsized&#x201D; boat.  Mystique took another team over to the second Dreadnaught to help them.  That looked a little more serious, so they were focusing on being a life boat.  Mystique&#x2019;s ship wasn&#x2019;t much of a transport ship, but the mess deck was big enough to hold a thousand people.  Mystique had also put up additional calls out through spacebird.net.  Should be a few ships coming to help soon.</p>
<p>When they hit the Dreadnaught Sammo got out the Cutters and set to work.  He carved out a healthy section of the hull.  They were ready in spacesuits for it just to be open vacuum, but it seems the ship had automatically shutoff some of the open-to-space sections.  It was cold, but it wasn&#x2019;t dead.  Sammo flicked on his light and could see a few dead engineers and a metal rod that looked like it was shorting a power couple.  &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll get this done in a giff cap.&#x201D;</p>
<hr>
<p>About a day later the Kartouri were already settled in about 1400 homes.  Some were concentrated in a few hospitals.  The Kartouri were pretty evenly split between dead and otherwise fine.  Santana took in Tanic himself in her home, a quiet homestead about an hour from Nagnarock by the maglev or even less if you took the underground tubes.  What are presumed to be his wife and kid weren&#x2019;t doing quite as well.  The woman, who Santana couldn&#x2019;t tell was either Margaret or Vanessa and the child were both taken to the hospital.  Some explosion had damaged the babies face and it seemed likely a bioic eye would be necessary.  Apparently a mother&#x2019;s instinct kicked in too and she had shielded the kid.  So, she was suffering from pretty serious burns across her back, but nothing some stem cells couldn&#x2019;t fix.</p>
<p>Tanic was still out cold.  Docs said he was ok and it was just a concussion.  He was now on a couch.  She had bought a tech tab for him.  She wrote out instructions, left the note on the tech tab, and went into town to grab food for two and some clothes.</p>

I run a group that&#x2019;s just about to hit 2,200 people and almost all of them are minnows.  They come from all over the world.  They speak different languages.  There are some constants between them.  </p>
<p>They often felt lonely on steemit before the group existed.<br>Their content wasn&#x2019;t getting any play.<br>The spent hours on posts and the return was shit.<br>They tried other tactics but things didn&#x2019;t stick.<br>Post rewards are low.<br>10 Votes a day only at 100% hurts interactions.<br>Flagging abuse<br>Making connections<br>and a million newbie questions on what the hell is steemit and how does it work.</p>
<p>Half of the Minnow Support Project is about helping these people just through providing a space and half is about reporting on and working on solutions.</p>
<h2 id="Minnow-pain-is-a-loud-pulse"><a href="#Minnow-pain-is-a-loud-pulse" class="headerlink" title="Minnow pain is a loud pulse "></a>Minnow pain is a loud pulse </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;ve had some really wonderful effect on helping minnows.  I&#x2019;ve helped get minnows into trending, their posts in the hundreds, some of the minnow pond guys are breaking 1k followers now, and people feel fairly united.  I&#x2019;ve worked my ass off and kept my ear to the ground for this community.  It&#x2019;s fun and it&#x2019;s also provided me with some fairly steady post rewards.  The purpose was good and it was addressing a serious pain in the community.  </p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re feeling frustrated or like something is really broken then try to network to find like minded people.  Report that news from the underground current to the folks that don&#x2019;t have it front and center.  My guess is that you&#x2019;ll start picking up followers that care about the same topics, many of them will be friends from that community whose opinions are shaping your own, and you&#x2019;ll see how you can grow.  Followers, resteems, friends, and upvotes should go up.</p>
<h2 id="Find-your-pulse-and-report"><a href="#Find-your-pulse-and-report" class="headerlink" title="Find your pulse and report "></a>Find your pulse and report </h2><h2></h2><p>So, find a pain, get your finger on the pulse, try to solve a problem, and let us know what&#x2019;s going on.  If you&#x2019;re on the pulse you&#x2019;ll find a community that&#x2019;s willing to help you.  I&#x2019;m sure of it, and if has to do with Minnows I know some people that will help.</p>

<p>Here&#x2019;s a recent picture from the reward pool.  Look at all that beautiful steem flowing over the dam.  I&#x2019;m not sure it&#x2019;s done equilabrating yet, but the reward pool stands at 983k steem.  That&#x2019;s about half of what it was before HF19 took effect.  I&#x2019;m glad to see that minnow votes are worth more, but I&#x2019;m not sure the tradeoff so far has been worth it.  In addition to the following concerns we&#x2019;ve shoved 1million steem into the already biggest authors.  Not a huge fan of that either.  I guess I missed the steemitblog announcement where the reward pool would be cut substantially by the recent hard fork.</p>
<h2 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros "></a>Pros </h2><h2></h2><ol>
<li>Minnow Votes were 50x more, but with the reward pool cut in half it&#x2019;s now down to 25x</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons "></a>Cons </h2><h2></h2><ol>
<li><p>Minnows don&#x2019;t get a slider and only get 10 votes a day, so they have to use full power votes each time.  It drains their power if they want to go above upvoting a few of their own posts, upvoting the handful of comments they like, and upvoting a few other peoples posts.  Then it starts draining, and that&#x2019;s cutting down on minnow/minnow interactions from what I can observe (haven&#x2019;t dug into more data yet, just first observations)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Views are down.  Not sure if it was just a spike in rewards and then a fall, or truly the 40 votes &#x2013;&gt; 10 votes has disincentivized finding new content, but again from observation it looks like overall views are down especially on minnow posts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Autovorotic behavior.  Peeps are self voting at all an all time high.  Sure, I guess it&#x2019;s your right to do with your steem power as you seem fit, but upvoting spammy shitty comments buried in low view pages doesn&#x2019;t seem like a good use of a community asset even if that portion was yours to spend.  Comment voting is up about 9X from what I can tell.  Pretty sure it&#x2019;s not newly engaged curating whale suddenly supporting lots of new comments from minnnows there.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The percentage of the reward pool seems to have increased on the top accounts.  Trending is mostly the same faces, but now those faces get an even larger portion of the pool.  That can&#x2019;t be good.  Like the world needs another mechanism to shove rewards to the highest earners. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, look.  Can you describe HF19 as good or bad objectively?  No, it&#x2019;s subjective.  I want to growth hack steemit and help minnows grow.  I don&#x2019;t think this hardfork is ultimately helping there because more of the rewards pool is going to top accounts than before and systemic abuse is on the rise.  Minnow votes are worth more, but it&#x2019;s not enough to drastically alter their fate especially with the change in viewership.  A short term spike in your ability to upvote isn&#x2019;t beneficial compared to the long term benefits of viewership, better peer-to-peer interaction in the comments section, and making friends with your power rather than the inclination to horde it post hard fork.  If you&#x2019;re looking for more liberty on how you spend your own steem power though even for shit reasons then I guess it&#x2019;s a win.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m still confused why we don&#x2019;t just allow 1 vote to take all the steem power for all eternity and power that into one giant vote&#x2026;  That would surely help.</p>
<p>I think HF19 was a backend hack to try to unfuck the real problem on the platform which is distribution.  Without even including @steemit the top 1% of accounts have 93% of the steem.  That&#x2019;s the real issue.  HF18 rules would be working fine if so much of the power wasn&#x2019;t in the hands of just a small minority of people.</p>

<p>This is cryptopunk.  It&#x2019;s like steampunk or diesel punk.  It depicts a different kind of life.  This one is scifi based.  You have the freedom loving people of Nagan VII and the bureaucratic Kartouri who seek to rule them.  Let&#x2019;s see what happens in eipisode 8.</p>
<hr>
<p>Muxxy and Welk were like two little school boys watching the fire works display.  &#x201C;Operation Excessive Fuckery&#x201D; worked perfectly.  Santana was pleased too.  They used Netuoso&#x2019;s hacking skills to overwrite the targetting system.  When the Karts made their violent intentions clear they activated the program and took over the targetting system.  In truth only two ships were out there.  Santana in Baby-4 and Mystique sailing the Discordiant.  All the other targets were weapons systems, engine systems, and other critical systems on the the Dreadnaughts.  Neither Mystique or Santana fired a shot.  The peace enforcers blew the shit out of each other.</p>
<p>Now for the rescue operation.  It hadn&#x2019;t been planned this way, but two of the Dreadnaught raider bitches actually shut down life support on one another.  Seems like the Kartouri put their engines a little too close to the circulation systems.  The couple holes they poked in the ships hull maybe led to a few deaths, but if they didn&#x2019;t get over there and patch life support or life boat everyone there was gonna be some blood on their hands.</p>
<p>Sammo?  You ready to launch?</p>
<p>&#x201C;Maam I&#x2019;m always ready to launch!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sammo, the newly hired ship&#x2019;s engineer released the docking clamps and shot out of the launch bay.  Muxxy, Welk, and Santana along with a skeleton crew flashed across the deep space horizon shooting towards Tanic&#x2019;s &#x201C;capsized&#x201D; boat.  Mystique took another team over to the second Dreadnaught to help them.  That looked a little more serious, so they were focusing on being a life boat.  Mystique&#x2019;s ship wasn&#x2019;t much of a transport ship, but the mess deck was big enough to hold a thousand people.  Mystique had also put up additional calls out through spacebird.net.  Should be a few ships coming to help soon.</p>
<p>When they hit the Dreadnaught Sammo got out the Cutters and set to work.  He carved out a healthy section of the hull.  They were ready in spacesuits for it just to be open vacuum, but it seems the ship had automatically shutoff some of the open-to-space sections.  It was cold, but it wasn&#x2019;t dead.  Sammo flicked on his light and could see a few dead engineers and a metal rod that looked like it was shorting a power couple.  &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll get this done in a giff cap.&#x201D;</p>
<hr>
<p>About a day later the Kartouri were already settled in about 1400 homes.  Some were concentrated in a few hospitals.  The Kartouri were pretty evenly split between dead and otherwise fine.  Santana took in Tanic himself in her home, a quiet homestead about an hour from Nagnarock by the maglev or even less if you took the underground tubes.  What are presumed to be his wife and kid weren&#x2019;t doing quite as well.  The woman, who Santana couldn&#x2019;t tell was either Margaret or Vanessa and the child were both taken to the hospital.  Some explosion had damaged the babies face and it seemed likely a bioic eye would be necessary.  Apparently a mother&#x2019;s instinct kicked in too and she had shielded the kid.  So, she was suffering from pretty serious burns across her back, but nothing some stem cells couldn&#x2019;t fix.</p>
<p>Tanic was still out cold.  Docs said he was ok and it was just a concussion.  He was now on a couch.  She had bought a tech tab for him.  She wrote out instructions, left the note on the tech tab, and went into town to grab food for two and some clothes.</p>
<h2 id="Episode-7-Consequences"><a href="#Episode-7-Consequences" class="headerlink" title="Episode 7- Consequences "></a>Episode 7- Consequences </h2><h2></h2><p>Tanic put down his new son Tanic Jr.  A blobby smily sort of child.  His eyes would wander around the room with curiosity.  Venessa, the mother, was on the bed.  It was awkward telling Margaret about what happened.  To her he had left for a minor mission, but for him it was 2-years and unclear if he&#x2019;d ever return.  Vanessa provided relief and a chance for a life, but now that he was back in his original universe it was difficult to explain.  It was mostly going back and forth on calls with endless sobbing.  He loved her dearly, but he hoped she would understand that it wasn&#x2019;t intentional infidelity.  What happens in other time lines and dimensions stays in them&#x2026; except for children.</p>
<p>He tickled Tanic Jr one more time and went to the bridge.</p>
<p> Tanic Elotaw allowed himself a smirk as his newly retrofitted Dreadnaught class Peace Enforcer exited Quantum slip outside of Nagan VII accompanied by two additional Peace Enforcers 141007 and 154022.  His weapons were ready.  Margaret hadn&#x2019;t snapped at him in a few hours, and Nagan VII was about to be bombarded to pieces.  He tugged his uniform tight and started his broadcast.</p>
<p>&#x201C;People of Nagan VII.  Your insurrection against the Kartouri Civilization is at an end.  Unless you issue uncondional surrender and agree to annexation by writ of Councilor Mago your civilization will be nuetrali&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
<p>The broadcast cut out unexpectedly.  The screen went blank, and after a brief disruption it flickered and his nemesis &#x201C;Admiral&#x201D; Santana appeared. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Tanic, I&#x2019;m sorry to see you again.  We have prepared for your arrival and will unroll the welcome mat if you don&#x2019;t leave immediately.  Head back to your Kartouri shithole either in peace or pieces.  The option is yours.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic laughed.  &#x201C;Santana, you may not know this but I&#x2019;ve been waiting two years for this opportunity.  I&#x2019;ve come with friends and the latest technology available to Kartouri.  We hereby suggest you power down, lay down your arms and prepare to be boarded.  We have no intention of leaving without annexati..&#x201D;  again the screen cut out.  There was a brief high pitched squeel, and then a hard hitting bass rythm starting pounding at rediculous levels on the bridge.  This was followed by a hard hitting drum solo on top of it.&#x201D;  He plugged his ears.  </p>
<p>His new weapons officer Digs started shouting, but it was broken up by the noise.  &#x201C;Com&#x2026; de.r.  There.. bogie&#x2026;. 360..&#x201D;  Tanic looked at the tactical display and saw several hundreds blips appear.  He also saw &#x201C;operation excessive fuckery&#x201D; on the screen.  &#x201C;Give me a visual&#x201D; he shouted, but Digs indicated he couldn&#x2019;t hear.  </p>
<p>The next second he was on the ground.  He looked at the HUD and saw 3 deck floors flashing yellow and apparently depressurizing.  He ran to the window and saw a flurry of torpedoes hitting his ship.  He knocked the ensign out of his chair and steered the ship towards the bogie, but his dreadnaught didn&#x2019;t respond.  The engines were powering down, and even life support was turned off.  He went back to the window and saw the other two peace enforcers were dark, and then his lights went off.  All that was left was functional was the deafening sound of the viking crypto metal band Fyrce pouding in the speakers.  A blast went off on the bridge knocking him down and unconscious.  </p>
<p>It was the last sound he heard as Santana&#x2019;s small fleet picked apart his ships apart.</p>

<p>Man,</p>
<p>Multiple ethical dramas of late.  It&#x2019;s been odd to see how they play out.  Not what I expected, and now I&#x2019;m forced to grow my perspective on things.  Thanks to those involved for holding the contrast.</p>
<p>The main one is @el-mago, but has since brought in @transisto, @gigafart, and @julianita.  It involves @minnowsupport, a bunch of minnows who are a few weeks old the platform and me.</p>
<p>Without a small bit of irony I recently wrote a piece about the last HF and titled it unintended consequences.  So, now I get to make my story about unintended consequences of my actions of which I blurred the lines of protagonist and antagonist.  </p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve been at running minnow support for less than 3 weeks.  The channel is about to have its 2,000th person enter.  I suspect that happens today or tomorrow.  It brings a lot of minor issues like tech support and howtos, but now it&#x2019;s big enough to present some ethical dilemnas.</p>
<p>@el-mago was taking porn shots he didn&#x2019;t own and posting them.  He got flagged by @cheetah and a member of MSP flagged him too.  @el-mago went and flagged the minnow&#x2019;s active posts and resteems too.  I requested multiple times that he take the flags off and said I&#x2019;d flag him if he didn&#x2019;t.  He threatened me, so I used @minnowsupport to flag his posts and some comments too.</p>
<p>Running through my head was-</p>
<p>He is abusing the system by stealing photos.<br>He is verbally abusive to users.<br>He&#x2019;s abusing the flagging system.<br>If he threatens me he&#x2019;ll have zero qualms going after others who are small.</p>
<p>Intended consequences- His posts went to zero.  And his rep went to -4.  Justice was served&#x2026; or not.</p>
<p>Unintended consequences-<br>@julianita and @transisto came through and upvoted his latest post to $50.<br>@gigafart who was following downvotes on the trail lost power to downvotes he didn&#x2019;t support.  I think he may have abandoned the trail.<br>Minnows weren&#x2019;t compensated for posts because the power was going to downvotes.<br>el-mago started flagging a series of minnows so I&#x2019;ve devoted time and power to individual upvotes beyond the standard vote available to all public members.<br>I&#x2019;ve written two posts giving someone a fair amount of exposure for comments and posts I don&#x2019;t support.</p>
<p>While reading the comments on his last post @transisto made a point about going into negative rep as censorship.  I can say it was my intention, but also that my intention there was wrong.  @transisto is right, people have a right to say things.  On this platform you can&#x2019;t censor hatespeech and verbal abuse without also unintentionally inhibiting one&#x2019;s ability to either defend himself, or do something different.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s easy to say &#x201C;I may hate your opinion on healthcare, but I&#x2019;ll defend your right to talk about it.&#x201D;  It&#x2019;s less clear when it&#x2019;s &#x201C;I hate when you string together a derogatory and offensive string of insults, but I&#x2019;ll defend your right to abuse people verbally.&#x201D;  One challenge is that on this platform I can&#x2019;t really segregate the two.  I suppose in hindsight it would have been better to try to warmly and kindly educate rather than launch flags that could have been avoided.  I&#x2019;m sorry I didn&#x2019;t do more of that.</p>
<p>Also, I was writing a memethenews post and realizing I&#x2019;m adding pictures that I don&#x2019;t own.  Memes are designed to be shared and spread.  Many members add a watermark now if they feel recognition of their work is important as opposed to just sharing for the lolz. Some of the underlying pics in the memes are themselves copyrighted.  I suppose creative commons protects them for use in education, but when it&#x2019;s commercial and Steem gets involved maybe that&#x2019;s a violation too.  I&#x2019;ve tried to use royalty free images for most of the random posts I&#x2019;ve done, but I can&#x2019;t guarantee I haven&#x2019;t taken someone else&#x2019;s work, profited from it, and in some ways that&#x2019;s reminiscent of what I flagging.  </p>
<p>Then I saw a comment in his last post from him about testing the steemit drama.  The whole comment seemed like it was in the spirit of deescalation.  I applaud that step and followed suit.  I&#x2019;ve removed the flags I placed using minnowsupport.  One post is past rewards and he lost 1 SBD.  I have sent him that.  I&#x2019;ve removed the flags from @aggroed.  I suggest minnows leave him be, and unflag his posts.  It&#x2019;s possible trailers will remain, but he should have enough upvotes from the other whales to more than compensate for their unintended flags.  </p>
<p>It&#x2019;s time to deescalate rather than escalate.  I should have tried harder in that regard to start.  I don&#x2019;t support the posts, the comments, the actions, but it would seem there are better approaches especially involving an account 10 days old.  So, here&#x2019;s hoping it goes well.  Welcome to the community @el-mago.  I wish you well and many blessings of peace and prosperity from here on out.  Make some original content.  I may even support it.</p>
<p>Now what to do about doxxing within minnowsupport?</p>
<p>As you were.</p>
