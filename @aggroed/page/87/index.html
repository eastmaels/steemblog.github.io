<p>So, I&#x2019;ve been reading @haejin articles just like half of this entire network for about two months.  One of the things that struck me was his idea of prices being a quantum phenomena and happen irrespective of news or anything else.  Price moves in pre-ordained existing patterns that repeat, and this appeals to me as a chemist.  Kids don&#x2019;t grow linearly.  They have growth spurts.  It&#x2019;s like they level up.  If kids do that and atoms do that, why not price and cryptos?</p>
<h2 id="Orbitals"><a href="#Orbitals" class="headerlink" title="Orbitals "></a>Orbitals </h2><h2></h2><p>Modern chemistry shows that atoms are comprised of protons, neutrons, and electrons.  The electrons orbit the nucleus holding protons and neutrons.  As the electrons get more energy they go into larger shells that contain them.  There are a few different types of shells called S orbitals, P orbitals, D orbitals and F orbitals.  When you move from 1S to 2S the shape doesn&#x2019;t change.  It just gets bigger.  2S and 2P look pretty different, so it&#x2019;s possible when energy levels get high enough that the pattern will shift, but for the mean time I can see similarity in chemistry orbitals of the same level and higher energy level (price) patterns in crypto prices.</p>
<p>In chemistry at least I can use something like a laser to elevate an electron from a low energy state to a high energy state.  In price land the only variable I seem to have is time.  The only real control I seem to have is timing.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmNWYGDBzXdGPW6tidgvvpcXH15DyKeVQV7k8dWqvw2Ybi/image.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Technical-Analysis"><a href="#Technical-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Technical Analysis "></a>Technical Analysis </h2><h2></h2><p>The basic premise is that the patterns in the charts are likely to repeat.  If you are able to discern the pattern then you have a leg up on your competition buying and selling coins.  I&#x2019;m sure to many it looks like reading tea leaves looking at charts and hoping there are patterns, but from what I can tell there are generally some highly repeating patterns worth looking into.  I&#x2019;m hardly an expert at the field at large but I&#x2019;m able to recognize patterns.</p>
<p>Now, one might question if this is such a wonderful thing why don&#x2019;t people do it?  The answer is&#x2026; they do.  Technical analysis seems to happen everywhere.  One of the main things though is that it&#x2019;s harder to do for stocks.  That&#x2019;s because the markets are so highly manipulated with high frequency trading and exchanges that buy ahead of customers.  </p>
<p>It&#x2019;s harder to cheat buying and selling cryptos and basically impossible with decentralized exchanges (looking at you Bitshares).</p>
<h2 id="Patterns"><a href="#Patterns" class="headerlink" title="Patterns: "></a>Patterns: </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;ve been looking at litecoin.  It already went up 30%.  I had bough it around $120, rode what I thought at the time was the high, traded some out, lost money on those, and recently consolidated all my coins back into litecoin.  One could legitimately say that I&#x2019;m acting out of turn here.  Seems a little nutz to buy in after a 30% gain in a few days, but I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;re done just yet.  Far from it I think we&#x2019;re about to go nuclear.  I think it enough to have put all my crypto eggs into that one basic (other than muh steem power).  I believe Steem and SBD will get their turn too.  Hopefully I&#x2019;ll catch those after I ride the litecoin blast.</p>
<h2 id="litecoin-charts"><a href="#litecoin-charts" class="headerlink" title="litecoin charts "></a>litecoin charts </h2><h2></h2><p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmZeNHHj3X58Pq4UdQp9w76BTCkfN8rZf3XAzPFhTamDzC/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s a picture of litecoin.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s another one.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmZ9pMshnBGmQeo8mp83ydLnPYunP7hF1Xt5uZ9kKVnwje/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Those two look rather uncannily similar to me.  What&#x2019;s really interesting is that they are taken months apart.  The first one is the picture of litecoin when it&#x2019;s about to achieve a record high.  The second one is where we are now.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s the total picture of where we are.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmcEdS9TQ5PNYRKL8EztjpqqjQybG846XaG5MGE7qppkEV/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To me, as a non expert, having barely traded much, this looks like we are about to repeat the cycle that gave us the largest surge in LTC price that we&#x2019;ve ever seen&#x2026; only this time we&#x2019;re starting a little higher and looks to be roughly 10% stronger.  We are going from the 1S orbital to the 2S orbital.  That&#x2019;s how I can wrap my head around this.</p>
<p>As I said I consolidated my holdings into LTC at around $218 (I sold all the other stuff I bought at a loss and reconsolidated into ltc).  I&#x2019;ve put in a limit sell order for USDT at $406.  I think the price surge will likely go around $420, but I&#x2019;m trying to be a little conservative on a risky bet.  I&#x2019;m then hoping to catch the mini correction prior to an all time high and then truly cash out of litecoin (except to maybe but the first fat dip that looks likely to follow).</p>
<h2 id="This-is-an-experiment"><a href="#This-is-an-experiment" class="headerlink" title="This is an experiment "></a>This is an experiment </h2><h2></h2><p>I realized I didn&#x2019;t like trading lots of coins.  Too much hassle and too much stuff to look at.  I&#x2019;m happier having just one coin and really only focusing on it&#x2019;s well being.  That&#x2019;s contrary to not keeping ones eggs all in one basket&#x2026; but in cryto we&#x2019;re all basically tied to btc anyway and since the market as a whole moves as a whole I&#x2019;m not sure owning more than one crypto is truly a diversified portfolio anyway.  I was losing sleep and time watching them all.  I don&#x2019;t think that approach is for me.</p>
<p>If the experiment works I&#x2019;ll look to repeat it.  I think Haejin&#x2019;s method for those that are comfortable buying and holding for a while is likely a better and safer long term play.  Buy a coin at a suspected low point and then just ride it all the way to to the top.  That&#x2019;s essentially his advice.  He&#x2019;s just trying to give some extra pointers on where he sees the bottom and top.</p>
<p>The approach I&#x2019;m going to try out while this market is rebounding is seeking out these patterns that show evidence nuclear explosion happening.  It&#x2019;s a lot easier after a massive dip.  So, I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll be trying this still in March.  That seems tricky af, but we&#x2019;re all sorta expecting recoveries right about now since it looks like BTC bottomed out.</p>
<h2 id="The-plan"><a href="#The-plan" class="headerlink" title="The plan "></a>The plan </h2><h2></h2><p>I want to get in literally a few days before a truly insane price breakout.  So, I&#x2019;m trying to catch them in the consolidation phase right before the nuclear pattern  happens.  Looks like for many coins that will follow a 30% increase.  Again, this looks nutz on paper, but not if the charts actually repeat.</p>
<p>So, I&#x2019;m pretty positive buying at the very lowest point is a better financial strat overall, but I&#x2019;m not quite that patient.  I get a little anxious, and I like large bets.</p>
<p>This plan isn&#x2019;t for everyone.  There&#x2019;s a good chance of loss after buying right after a pump, but I&#x2019;m willing to run this experiment and see if it&#x2019;s successful.  It&#x2019;s not a method yet, just a hypothesis.  Worst case I own a bunch of litecoin, which I think is an undervalued coin anyway even after a 30% pump.</p>
<p>Wish me luck.</p>
<h2 id="Disclaimer"><a href="#Disclaimer" class="headerlink" title="Disclaimer "></a>Disclaimer </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m not trying to give you advice.  I&#x2019;m trying to document my decisions on the block before events unfold.  You gotta figure out what&#x2019;s right for you and your family.  There&#x2019;s no way I can gauge your financial picture or ability to handle risk.  Get a planner.  Don&#x2019;t rely on my inexperienced ass thinking I can read tea leaves in charts.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s other legal mumbo jumbo, but basically you gotta own your own risk suckah.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;ll see in a week or two if I&#x2019;m a fool for buying after a 30% rise, a genius after predicting a rise, or a lucky guy who picked a crypto in a bull market during a correction, or just rando posting TA hoping that some whale gets lucky on the pick and ride that train as long as possible.</p>

<p>I have a very dynamic show for you today.  We start with a little financial blabber from me, switch to a new food project on the block, hang out with my friend and cofounder of MSP @ausbitbank, get involved in a very dynamic interview with @suzi3d, and wrap up with a great conversation with @teamsteem. It&#x2019;s a great one! </p>
<h2 id="On-the-Show"><a href="#On-the-Show" class="headerlink" title="On the Show: "></a>On the Show: </h2><h2></h2><p>12:30- We talk about a new group of folks working on food blogging, vlogging, and contests!  @offoodandart is the mother of @theywillkillyou who own a 1M sub Youtube channel of the same name.  I&#x2019;m looking forward to what they come up with!</p>
<p>@chefsteve<br>@christinepoulos<br>@offoodandart</p>
<p>@bait002<br>I&#x2019;m happy to introduce Bait.  He&#x2019;s a Nigerian that&#x2019;s working on building up the already 20,000 strong community.  He runs a group called the Minnow Schools and teaches people how to use crypto.  He&#x2019;s also working on steemexchanger which is a automated program to turn steem into African currencies.  This is game changing because right now Africans are mostly reliant on converting between crypto and fiat using telegram groups.  This is an automated way to exchange currencies, which can remove trust issues between counter parties and eliminate a major hurdle to decentralized transactions.  Updates can be found on the @steemexchanger blog.</p>
<p>@ausbitbank comes on the show around the 1:06:00</p>
<p>We talk about finding Steem through a trading group that was looking for developers and looking for ways to circumvent controlled media.</p>
<p>We talk about the pathway from content creation to content curation as he&#x2019;s become a whale.  We talk about managing projects on the block, a day in the life of Ausbitbank, and what it&#x2019;s like managing the Minnow Support Project.</p>
<p>@suzi3d 1:40:00 live from Moscow.  Suzi is a powerhouse independent journalist bringing other journalists to the Steem platform and sharing her story of going from a suburban mom to a vigilant citizen against the corruption of the deep state through the massive private spy networks that have been created.  This was a powerful interview for me and I hope you take some time to go through it.</p>
<p>@teamsteem 2:59:00 joins us to share his enthusiasm for the steem blockchain, the pursuit of truth in a fake news world, and talks a little about how we handles his trading and shares one of his favorite sites: <a href="http://newbium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://newbium.com/</a>.  We also talk about some of the value of block chain currencies instead of fiat currencies.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m super pleased to present to the community the next panel-  Steem Queens!!!  I&#x2019;ve gathered up some of the best known ladies on the platform to provide what should be an extremely entertaining panel discussion.</p>
<h2 id="The-Queens"><a href="#The-Queens" class="headerlink" title="The Queens "></a>The Queens </h2><h2></h2><p>@stellabelle-  Literally the first thing I did on this platform when I got here was follow @stellabelle.  I&#x2019;m pretty sure it was a post by her that got shared to my facebook feed that brought me to Steem.  It&#x2019;s my absolute pleasure to bring my friend Stella onto the show!  I&#x2019;m sure we&#x2019;re going to hear how Slothicorn will grow and ultimately change the world.  Maybe she can tell us what Steem was like back in olden times circa early 2016!</p>
<p>@allasyummyfood-  It seems that Alla may have mastered the art of Dtube.  She&#x2019;s entertaining, charming, and is trailblazing as a foodie on the Steem blockchain.  She&#x2019;s killing it, which is great especially as she&#x2019;s recently turned full time Steemian.  I&#x2019;m very much looking forward to see just how much she&#x2019;ll grow the platform with her content!</p>
<p>@gringalicious- Another lady I owe a personal debt to.  She was one of my first sizable witness votes on the platform.  It&#x2019;s been fun to watch her growth with her photography and her take on food.  It&#x2019;s fun to see someone who is part of an active Steem family blog about it.  Gringalicious is a little worried about travel arrangements for the panel and potential conflicts, but I&#x2019;m putting her on as a yes even though we may have a last minute cancellation.</p>
<p>@rhondak-  I met @rhondak early on in the life of the <a href="minnowpond.org">Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord Channel</a>.  She came in as a spitfire story editor giving dagger sharp critiques.  She built up a highly active channel, took on the moderator tag, and before long outgrew the Minnow Support Project.  She started the Writer&#x2019;s Block, which has hundreds of dedicated and professional authors in it in with @gmuxx.  I can&#x2019;t wait to see where it goes and looking forward to one day publishing some Steem Memoirs with her future publishing company.</p>
<p>@patrice-  Witness turned crime fighter extraordinaire will be joining us.  She&#x2019;s the highest ranked female run witness on the Steem blockchain, and she&#x2019;s the day-to-day manager of some of the Steem blockchain&#x2019;s biggest anti-abuse bots.  We&#x2019;ll talk about her work and her rise in the Witness ranks.  Grats on top 50.  51 &#x2013;&gt; 50 was the worst!!!</p>
<h2 id="Muh-Co-host-crimsonclad"><a href="#Muh-Co-host-crimsonclad" class="headerlink" title="Muh Co-host @crimsonclad! "></a>Muh Co-host @crimsonclad! </h2><h2></h2><p>Crimson serves as a moderator on more Steem based Discord groups than you even knew existed.  She leads the committee for PALnet Discord and watches over our digital home like a momma hawk.  She&#x2019;s a talented photographer, an accomplished front end designer, a MSP Medal of Honor winner, and one of my dearest friends on the platform.   </p>
<h2 id="Extra-Addition"><a href="#Extra-Addition" class="headerlink" title="Extra Addition! "></a>Extra Addition! </h2><h2></h2><p>Looks like we&#x2019;re be getting @beanz to join us as well!!  Beanz runs the Voices of the Underground podcast and Discord server.  I&#x2019;ve been lucky enough to be on the show and talk about the Steem network with her.  I&#x2019;m looking forward to her thoughts on what it takes to grow an account and a channel on Steem.</p>
<h2 id="Logistics"><a href="#Logistics" class="headerlink" title="Logistics "></a>Logistics </h2><h2></h2><p>The show starts on Saturday February 17, 2018 at 11am EST (1600 UTC).  Shows typically run for 1.5-2 hours.<br>You can join the show by joining the <a href="minnowpond.org">Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network</a>.<br>I typically start DJing around 10:30am to give guests something to listen to and to give panel members a chance to test their audio in Discord.  You&#x2019;ll need a headset and a microphone ideally though a cell phone can work.<br>If you&#x2019;d like to participate in the chat you can join us in the <a href="https://discord.gg/pGHjVtc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">audience channel</a></p>
<h2 id="Post-show"><a href="#Post-show" class="headerlink" title="Post show "></a>Post show </h2><h2></h2><p>Leaders of female centric Discord groups are welcome to come towards the end of the show to pitch their Discord Channels to audience members who are looking for that experience.</p>
<h2 id="Topics"><a href="#Topics" class="headerlink" title="Topics "></a>Topics </h2><h2></h2><p>This show is airing on the MSP-Waves.  MSP is the Minnow Support Project.  Like many things for MSP this show is geared towards figuring out how to grow, and these Queens represent some of the best success stories that we have.  While I believe the show will be educational and entertaining for everyone I hope it will be especially useful for our female audience members.  I imagine the stories of those who have been successful will help others looking to do the same.</p>
<h2 id="kaylinart"><a href="#kaylinart" class="headerlink" title="@kaylinart "></a>@kaylinart </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;ve reached out via steemit.chat and on your wall.  If you&#x2019;d like to be on this panel I&#x2019;d be thrilled!!!  I&#x2019;m eternally in your debt and want to sing your praises!  I wouldn&#x2019;t be here and really neither would all of PALnet or MSP without your help.</p>
<h2 id="Should-be-fun"><a href="#Should-be-fun" class="headerlink" title="Should be fun! "></a>Should be fun! </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m looking forward to hearing success stories from these ladies.  I&#x2019;ve been entertained by their content and looking forward to getting to know them more and hearing about what it takes to get to their level.  </p>
<p>Same rules apply here as to all the other panels.  We have community standards in terms of how folks are welcome to talk to one another.  Disagreements are certainly allowed and discussion may be warranted, but everyone is expected to stay respectful.  Folks that can&#x2019;t abide by that will be removed from PALnet.</p>

<p>Here&#x2019;s the chart for Litecoin.  I&#x2019;ve been watching this intensely now that I&#x2019;m holding a 65 of them.  I was mildly relieved when we passed out of the lower resistance line, pretty glad when we got out of the higher resistance line.  Very pleased now that we&#x2019;re zooming up.  I&#x2019;m hoping this is a leading indicator for the some of the other major coins.</p>
<h2 id="BTC"><a href="#BTC" class="headerlink" title="BTC "></a>BTC </h2><h2></h2><p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmc5N9sFg8n6gJ7kFkbjMxv32uG1SUkj8XqUsc3QsZUTgH/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Sorry that my chart is a little busy.  I think we did an impulse up out of the bottom at 6k.  We hit the resistance line and crashed back to 7800.  We went back to the resistance line, and crashed back one more time to the support.  Now we&#x2019;re at the far right side of the neck line, which is an easier place to breach.  Nature finds a way.  So, I imagine many whales are waiting with anxiety for this to resolve too.  Looks like 12-24 more hours and we could have our answer.  Based on LTC exploding I&#x2019;m a little more confidant that we are seeing the first of a major rebounding impulse.  It just looks shitty and weak because BTC had two major resistance lines close by that were surpressing it down.  </p>
<p>The head and shoulders still isn&#x2019;t confirmed so if you like sleeping at night then you may not want to invest until BTC goes back up to 8100 or more and stays above the neckline for 4-24hrs.  If you&#x2019;re a little loco you could toss in now and gamble that the true recovery has started and we&#x2019;re not going down one more lower low.</p>
<p>My bet that I already made is that 2 days from now BTC goes nearly vertical and bounce off the upper projections around 10600.</p>
<h2 id="ETH"><a href="#ETH" class="headerlink" title="ETH "></a>ETH </h2><h2></h2><p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmUEDmUjwGS1DAR76xVfgzoMPHch28E2XueTfMQf2tGFqB/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Eth holders are in roughly the same bag as the BTC folks.  We&#x2019;re out of the first resistance line, we&#x2019;re out of the second, but still haven&#x2019;t resolved the head and shoulders.  Again, folks are gonna sleep better if they toss money in after price exceeds the neckline of the head and shoulders and stays there for 4-24hrs before investing.  It took LTC a few days to pop even after it cleared so you may not miss the chance for the pop while also not risking a fortune betting before a confirmation.</p>
<h2 id="Taken-together"><a href="#Taken-together" class="headerlink" title="Taken together "></a>Taken together </h2><h2></h2><p>This market seems to move as a big machine together.  Money comes in and sloshes back and forth between the alts and the mains.  It&#x2019;s hard to just look at one coin and figure out what the market is going to do.  When I look I think there&#x2019;s a solid chance we&#x2019;re like a recently divorced person&#x2026; time to rebound!!!  LTC gives me hope that I made the right call buying when I did.  Hopefully it pans out well for others that cash in over the next few days and here&#x2019;s hoping we&#x2019;re not in for another lower low.</p>
<h2 id="Due-Diligence"><a href="#Due-Diligence" class="headerlink" title="Due Diligence "></a>Due Diligence </h2><h2></h2><p>Lots of people put out price stuff these days.  Hard not to when the it&#x2019;s clearly a path to success on Steem.  I recently added in a lot of cash from a 401k so I&#x2019;m watching this stuff like a hawk mostly to ensure I don&#x2019;t lose it and wake up dead from my wife.  Anyway, make your own financial decisions and keep this as one data point for your own due diligence.</p>
<p>I pity the fool that takes my inexperienced ramblings at trading as solid investor advice.</p>
