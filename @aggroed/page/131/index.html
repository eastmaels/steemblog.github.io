<p>Ok, well we&#x2019;re starting to get a little content in the MSPL library.  It&#x2019;s slow going doing a weekly contest, but as we get more I think it&#x2019;ll take off faster.  You can check out what we have so far here <a href="http://www.steemshelves.com/steemit-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.steemshelves.com/steemit-development/</a>.  Steemshelves is a website by MSP moderator @rhondak that can archive all your posts.  That way when you&#x2019;re running a series on your wall, but you&#x2019;re also active on other topics you can keep all the same topics in one place.</p>
<h2 id="Winning-Posts"><a href="#Winning-Posts" class="headerlink" title="Winning Posts "></a>Winning Posts </h2><h2></h2><p><a href="https://steemit.com/programming/@thatdamiguy/html-for-noobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/programming/@thatdamiguy/html-for-noobs</a></p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/programming/@harshallele/html5-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/programming/@harshallele/html5-tutorial</a></p>
<p>Both were pretty excellent and somewhat similar, so rather than choosing one I gave them both 25 SBD, a resteem, and archived them in steemshelves.</p>
<h2 id="Next-Up"><a href="#Next-Up" class="headerlink" title="Next Up! "></a>Next Up! </h2><h2></h2><p>I want an article that&#x2019;s basically a consumer reports style post on which program people should choose to code in.  Share what&#x2019;s free, what&#x2019;s good for beginners, and what&#x2019;s the best effin&#x2019; program out there.  Share the pros and cons.  Why do you code with one?  Give some tips on their use.</p>
<p>This one is a little easier so I&#x2019;m going with 25SBD contest.  If this post gets a lot of love then I&#x2019;ll add more.</p>
<p>Deadline is when the post pays out.  </p>
<p>Be sure to tag the post you make with MSPL.</p>

<p>When I first met @followbtcnews and @crimsonclad I didn&#x2019;t know what I was going to get.  They came into the Minnow Pond full steem ahead with a vision that they were going to help people.  In the beginning I thought I would have to do a ton to sell folks on the mission, but these two came in pumped, ready to go, and good to work.  It&#x2019;s no wonder that they built a gorgeous webage for the community (minnowsupportproject.org), it&#x2019;s no wonder that they became a witness and having a great run at it, it&#x2019;s no wonder they both took on radio shows, and it&#x2019;s no wonder they keep pumping out new tools and resources for the Steemit Community and the MSP community.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve gotten to know them both over the last few months.  Follow is a shrewd businessman that understand crypto like it&#x2019;s his backyard.  I find him thoughtful, insightful, dedicated and talented.  He&#x2019;s got southern charm and a mission driven heart.  @crimsonclad is well, Crimmy, one of the most passionate and dedicated people I&#x2019;ve met on the platform.  From day one she&#x2019;s been engaged in the community, beloved by the community, and a tireless advocate for this place.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s an absolute pleasure to introduce you to them if you haven&#x2019;t met them.  Also, since not only are they moderators but also witnesses I can tell you that you need to go to www.steemit.com/~witnesses, scroll under the list of names and add &#x201C;followbtcnews&#x201D; into the box.  If you would rather not have to deal with it but would like to support minnows feel free to add aggroed as a proxy and you&#x2019;ll vote the same people I do (basically all the new witnesses coming out of the Minnow Support Group).</p>

Its a very euphoric feeling to see someone provide for their family from earnings made by blogging on Steemit.</h2><h2 id="crimsonclad-This-may-seem-like-a-strange-answer-but-I-love-the-way-the-platform-is-structured-both-for-anything-goes-but-also-that-it-contains-a-control-of-error-the-rep-system-to-help-users-decide-on-what-they-truly-value-on-the-platform-Though-we-do-see-some-unfair-distribution-and-rep-cannot-cure-all-ills-I-love-the-idea-that-despite-having-free-reign-to-do-whatever-you-can-think-up-on-Steemit-in-general-people-bond-together-and-seek-to-do-good-to-counteract-the-bad-This-will-change-with-iterations-of-Steemit-but-the-fact-remains-we&#x2019;re-in-the-midst-of-a-social-experiment-with-an-effective-hall-pass-and-overall-we&#x2019;re-still-going-to-classes-and-studying-hard-That-tells-you-a-lot-about-the-majority-of-people-here"><a href="#crimsonclad-This-may-seem-like-a-strange-answer-but-I-love-the-way-the-platform-is-structured-both-for-anything-goes-but-also-that-it-contains-a-control-of-error-the-rep-system-to-help-users-decide-on-what-they-truly-value-on-the-platform-Though-we-do-see-some-unfair-distribution-and-rep-cannot-cure-all-ills-I-love-the-idea-that-despite-having-free-reign-to-do-whatever-you-can-think-up-on-Steemit-in-general-people-bond-together-and-seek-to-do-good-to-counteract-the-bad-This-will-change-with-iterations-of-Steemit-but-the-fact-remains-we&#x2019;re-in-the-midst-of-a-social-experiment-with-an-effective-hall-pass-and-overall-we&#x2019;re-still-going-to-classes-and-studying-hard-That-tells-you-a-lot-about-the-majority-of-people-here" class="headerlink" title="@crimsonclad This may seem like a strange answer, but I love the way the platform is structured both for anything goes, but also that it contains a control of error (the rep system) to help users decide on what they truly value on the platform.

Additionally, they will go and tell their family members, friends and everybody they know about Steemit.</h2><h2 id="crimsonclad-&#x201C;I&#x2019;m-a-minnow-myself-I&#x2019;m-a-big-dork-I-love-metal-and-taking-photos"><a href="#crimsonclad-&#x201C;I&#x2019;m-a-minnow-myself-I&#x2019;m-a-big-dork-I-love-metal-and-taking-photos" class="headerlink" title="@crimsonclad &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a minnow myself.

<p>I&#x2019;ve been doing the Minnow Mayor Townhall for a while now.  Maybe a month.  I&#x2019;ve done a bunch of pirate shows too when we first started and didn&#x2019;t have as many DJs, but I gotta say that was my favorite show I&#x2019;ve done.  6 months ago I asked Stella if I could interview her, and I finally got my chance on air.  The lady did not disappoint!</p>
<p>@stellabelle I continue to find you and your story inspirational.  I enjoyed talking about the broad view of the Steemit ecosystem with you.  I think your thoughts on building a tribal community is spot on.  I&#x2019;ve shared before this place supports the authors as much as they do the content of the posts, so taking time to build out your community is so worth it.</p>
<p>We touched on addiction and some of the depression that comes with the awakening.  A large number of awake people at some point go through a &#x201C;I lost everything&#x201D; moment or period and that impacts their understanding of how this planet works.</p>
<p>You used Planet Steem a number of times.  We do seem a little off in our own little world sometimes, but I think that with a focus on building tools, community, and community tools we&#x2019;ll continue to grow our little Planet into a giant one.  Steemit is so powerful in it&#x2019;s ability to spread peace and non-violence, abundance through actions that cost little or nothing, and censorship resistant speech except when the community doesn&#x2019;t want it.  It&#x2019;s not just a game changer, but a world changer.</p>
<p>More than just your thoughts I find you an incredibly passionate soul.  I like how you&#x2019;re mentoring people and trying to spread the values beyond through teaching.  I&#x2019;m an educator too and I can see the value in what you&#x2019;re doing.  My short answer is that you&#x2019;re a class act beyond what I already thought (and I already held you in high esteem).</p>
<h2 id="The-audience"><a href="#The-audience" class="headerlink" title="The audience "></a>The audience </h2><h2></h2><p>We also had a pretty solid audience show up.  I believe we capped out at 40 people on the show.  Averaged around 32 for most of the show and likely had at least 60 folks come through.  You all were engaged, thoughtful, and hopefully had some fun with the delegations and dice.</p>
<p>Thanks to @swelker101 for taking over dice for me that night.  I coudn&#x2019;t do both the interview and Dice Bitches!   So, thanks!</p>
<p>The Dice Bitches game changed a little because of time pressure, but looks like @gmuxx and @bearone took home a prize of 25 SBD each.  Good times!</p>
<h2 id="1500-SP-delegation"><a href="#1500-SP-delegation" class="headerlink" title="1500 SP delegation "></a>1500 SP delegation </h2><h2></h2><p>I had included a 1500 SP delegation contest.  It was a scavenger hunt designed to force minnows to do things that dolphins do.  We had a dozen people enter and I had 10 people that had completed it show up in the channel.  So all told you had a 10% chance to win if you participated.  Anyway, the winner with @avesa and I sent them 1500SP as a delegation this morning.  Bud, you get to keep that until you earn 5000 SP on your own, and then you need to send it back so I can continue to pay it forward.</p>
<h2 id="500-SP-delegation"><a href="#500-SP-delegation" class="headerlink" title="500 SP delegation "></a>500 SP delegation </h2><h2></h2><p>So, this was one of my favorite moments of the night.  I like running the contests, but also, I love the spirit that manifested.  The contest works by folks recruit others into the show and they get a chance for a delgation.  @choogirl worked her ass off and brought a ton of people into the show.  So, she got more &#x201C;tickets&#x201D; than other people in the raffle, and as a result of that hard work she won.  Immediately, without prompting she says &#x201C;I want to split the reward with the person I brought in&#x201D; that was @bmj a member of teamaustralia so they&#x2019;ve got 250 SP delegation sitting in their wallet (when you hit 5k SP earned you gotta give it back).  </p>
<p>@choogirl isn&#x2019;t done yet though.  She says &#x201C;Also, I&#x2019;m gonna give my other half to my girl Kubby!&#x201D;  Which in itself is awesome.  I love the culture of giving, but then Kubby says &#x201C;WOOT, and I&#x2019;m proxying for my girl @uniwhisp!&#x201D;  So, just like that the 250 SP delegation gets passed a few times.  So, Choogirl gets the rush of winning and giving.  @kubbyelizabeth gets the rush of giving, and @uniwhisp gets a very well earned and well deserved 250 SP delegation.  She&#x2019;s a class act, helps run the radio station, and is just a very caring person.</p>
<p>So, on top of a fantastic discussion with my girl Stella I also got to witness some of the most wonderful gifting culture I could hope for just in my little neck of the woods.  It literally brings a tear to my eye and I give you a very grateful, love filled, and humbled thank you!  MSP man&#x2026; you folks are a dream come true.</p>
<p>Namaste,<br>your teary-eyed witness, </p>

<p>So, just had my first voice call with Stella as we approach show time as a bit of a prep for the show.  I&#x2019;ve loved her writing for a while, but to really hear her first hand in thoughtful conversation I was blown away.  What a class act!  What a thoughtful lady!  She&#x2019;s awesomer than I even thought.  So, I&#x2019;m completely thrilled (even more so than before) to have her on The Minnow Mayor Town Hall show.  It&#x2019;s going on live tonight in 5 hrs (9pm New York Time).</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re wondering what we&#x2019;re gonna talk about&#x2026; here&#x2019;s your hint: Tribes!</p>
<h2 id="Contests"><a href="#Contests" class="headerlink" title="Contests "></a>Contests </h2><h2></h2><p>3 Contests will happen on the show.</p>
<ol>
<li>1500 Delegated SP from a scavenger hunt I released earlier this week- <a href="https://steemit.com/mspwaves/@aggroed/stellabelle-to-star-on-the-minnow-mayor-town-hall-this-sunday-night-9-11-est-2-000-sp-delegation-contest-and-50-sbd-inside" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/mspwaves/@aggroed/stellabelle-to-star-on-the-minnow-mayor-town-hall-this-sunday-night-9-11-est-2-000-sp-delegation-contest-and-50-sbd-inside</a></li>
<li>500 SP from an in show contest where the audience will recruit other listeners and for every person you recruit you get an extra &#x201C;raffle ticket&#x201D;</li>
<li>Dice Bitches-  We&#x2019;ll roll some bones and the winner will get 25SBD (we&#x2019;ll do this twice on the second half of the show)</li>
</ol>
<p>But you gotta be there if you want to win!!!  So, check out mspwaves.com/listen to hear the show and go to the PALnet Discord channel home of the Minnow Support Channel- <a href="https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy!" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy!</a></p>
<h2 id="Quick-Side-Note"><a href="#Quick-Side-Note" class="headerlink" title="Quick Side Note "></a>Quick Side Note </h2><h2></h2><p>The scavenger hunt for 1500 SP has a number of things you need to do for your shot at the 1500 SP.  These are purposefully designed to help and encourage you to do some of the things that separate dolphins from minnows.  So, the things on that list are things you already should know how to do, and if you don&#x2019;t now&#x2019;s the time to learn.  It&#x2019;s your Dolphin 101 homework with an MSP theme and a 1500 delegated SP potential as your reward.</p>
<h2 id="Should-be-fun"><a href="#Should-be-fun" class="headerlink" title="Should be fun! "></a>Should be fun! </h2><h2></h2><p>See you there!</p>

<p>OK, well, turns out I&#x2019;m a Leet Witness!!!!  Not really in the technical sense of that, but in the sense that I passed 1337 Witness votes!  So, that&#x2019;s awesome.  I&#x2019;m highly appreciative of the support you&#x2019;re giving me.  I&#x2019;m turning that back to support the minnows in the pond grow their accounts.</p>
<p>I asked them each the same set of questions as the other mods.</p>

<p>I don&#x2019;t know if you&#x2019;ve met this young lady, her name is @stellabelle.  She&#x2019;s kinda a big deal around here.  You know&#x2026; 6,000+ followers.  One of the first active accounts on the platform.  She&#x2019;s got puppets of puppets.  You know her.  You love her.  She&#x2019;s Stella!</p>
<p>So, anyway(s) she and I have been chatting it up for a few months now.  Nice lady.  She&#x2019;s a member of the Steemit Broken Hearts Club too I think (anyone reading this is likely to be in it).  We&#x2019;ve been getting along swimmingly.  Anyway, she ran a Steemfest contest for minnows, which as you might have guessed as the founder of the Minnow Support Project I was glad to see.  She&#x2019;s constantly resteeming folks, sometimes getting in a wee bit of trouble with some of steemit bad boyz, but generally she&#x2019;s out there making waves.</p>
<p>Well, this time she&#x2019;s not just making waves she&#x2019;ll be riding them on MSPWaves radio!  She&#x2019;ll be with none other than MSP Top 20 Witness turned MSP Waves DJ SkankyJ!!!  It&#x2019;s the first on air Steemit celebrity I&#x2019;m gonna bring on and you won&#x2019;t want to miss it.  Not just cause she&#x2019;s got some cool shit she&#x2019;s got to talk about, but also because I&#x2019;m going to bribe the shit out of you to listen.</p>
<p>To listen to the show go to the PALnet discord group and join the mspwaves-audience text chat and also listen in from mspwaves.com/listen.</p>

<li>Take a screen shot of you telling any of the jr mods, mods, or sr mods, that you appreciate the fact that they dedicate time to support minnows making their way on the platform and/or give them any other compliment.</li>
<li>Use the @lovejuice bid bot to put a vote on a post that isn&#x2019;t your post (make a transfer of 0.1SBD and put a post URL of someone else&#x2019;s post in the transfer note).  Take a screenshot.</li>
<li>Make an original piece of art, haiku, or 55 word flash fiction story.  Include it in your post.</li>
<li>Leave a comment on a friends blog post letting them know about this contest and take a screen shot of that too.</li>
<li>Delegate 1sp or more to any MSP bot of your choice.  Take a screen shot. (5-50 to minnowsupport or msp-shanehug will get you an automatic vote from an MSP bot).  Use this link to get your delegation done- <a href="https://mspdelegator.herokuapp.com/mspdelegator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://mspdelegator.herokuapp.com/mspdelegator</a> (Putting a delegation on is instant, taking it off takes 7 days, to remove simply repeat the exact same process but choose 0 as the Steem Power amount).  If you have 50 SP or less you are excused from section 7.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you complete all 7 steps and put your post in the comments below then I&#x2019;ll resteem it from @aggroed (to return the favor of your resteem from step 1).  </p>
<h2 id="Winner"><a href="#Winner" class="headerlink" title="Winner "></a>Winner </h2><h2></h2><p>Everyone that was eligible for the scavenger hunt award and is <em>present during the show</em> will be placed in a lottery and during the interview section we&#x2019;ll use a publicly visible dice roll to determine the winner.  In the event of a 1 being rolled the delegation will be pushed to next week&#x2019;s show.</p>
<h2 id="Contest-2-500-Steem-Power-Delegation"><a href="#Contest-2-500-Steem-Power-Delegation" class="headerlink" title="Contest 2 (500 Steem Power Delegation) "></a>Contest 2 (500 Steem Power Delegation) </h2><h2></h2><p>Once you&#x2019;re in the chatroom for the show start recruiting people.  Every time you recruit someone you get your name added as a recruiter and they get their name added as a recruitee.  We&#x2019;ll roll dice to see which pair wins.  The recruiter can choose to keep or split the 500 SP delegation.  In the event I roll a one we push it to next week.</p>
<h2 id="Additional-Rules"><a href="#Additional-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Additional Rules "></a>Additional Rules </h2><h2></h2><p>These delegations are meant for minnows.  If you have earned less than 5000 SP you&#x2019;re eligible to win for yourself.  Anyone can choose to play for someone else (as long as that person has earned less than 5,000 SP).  Here&#x2019;s the thing.  The delegation sticks around until you have earned the 5,000 SP.  So, this isn&#x2019;t necessarily a 1 week or 1 month thing.  Could be there for a few months.  Wouldn&#x2019;t that be cool!?!  </p>
<h2 id="Dice-Bitches-rules"><a href="#Dice-Bitches-rules" class="headerlink" title="Dice Bitches (rules) "></a>Dice Bitches (rules) </h2><h2></h2><p>Up for grabs is 25 SBD (we&#x2019;ll do this twice)<br>Aggroed rolls dice using the &#x201C;t!dice 15d15&#x201D; command.<br>You then do the same.  If you beat or tie the roll you get moved to the next round.<br>If you get less than Aggroed you don&#x2019;t get to roll in the next round.<br>You can tell which round we&#x2019;re in because it will start with 15d15, then move down to 14d14, then 13d13 and so on.<br>On the last roll if Aggroed wins we start from scratch.  If there is someone standing (doesn&#x2019;t have to be a Minnow) I&#x2019;ll send you 25 SBD.<br>If Aggroed wins the second round then we&#x2019;ll just do a 1d100 and highest roll wins.  In the event of a tie there will be another roll off.</p>
<p>On this show because there&#x2019;s a 50 SBD instead of the normal 25 SBD at stake we&#x2019;ll play through &#x201C;Dice Bitches!&#x201D; twice.</p>
