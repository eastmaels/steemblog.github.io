<p>So, tonight is saturday night, and that means IT&#x2019;S TIME FOR RANDOM ASS RADIO!  Who knows what we&#x2019;ll do.  It&#x2019;ll probably have some music.  We&#x2019;ll talk about random stuff.  Spill some of the beans on Steem-Engine.  Talk about Steem Monsters.  I&#x2019;ll mention Steem Alliance.  We&#x2019;ll just take it nice and slow and see where the evening takes us.  Is that ok with you baby?  We&#x2019;ll just take it easy and see wherever the night leads us?</p>

<p>SCOT stands for Smart Contract Organizational Token.  It&#x2019;s a Steem-Engine.com project.  We&#x2019;re taking the white paper for Smart Media Tokens (SMTs) and delivering on it to the best of our ability <strong>NOW</strong>.  This post marks the formal beginning of live testing of the prototype we call Novel Distribution: Smart Contract Organizational Token (ND SCOT).</p>
<h2 id="Who-are-we"><a href="#Who-are-we" class="headerlink" title="Who are we?"></a>Who are we?</h2><p>aggroed manages the project as a whole<br>crystalhuman and clayboyn help out with customer support and content</p>

<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-the-Vision-Tokenize-your-community"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-the-Vision-Tokenize-your-community" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s the Vision - Tokenize your community!"></a>What&#x2019;s the Vision - Tokenize your community!</h2><p>You have a community and you&#x2019;d like to monetize it.  You create a token, distribute it, and users stake it.  They go to yourcoolwebsite.com where you run something that looks a lot like steemit.com (condenser) or your own custom UI; however, the rewards are in COOL tokens, the users don&#x2019;t see every steem post out there by default, and you have more control of what&#x2019;s happening on the site.  You&#x2019;ve created your own custom website, from and for your own community, with your own token, and it distributes similarly to Steem.  It trades on steem-engine.com against Steem but you can trade it for  BTC, LTC, BCH, and DOGE nor or against ETH/EOS/BTS/Tron in the near future.</p>
<p>Your token is a success and you&#x2019;re able to sell what you bought, traded, mined, earned, or minted to the community.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s like the vision for SMTs, but happening today through Steem-Engine.com.</p>
<h2 id="Where-is-the-project-at-now"><a href="#Where-is-the-project-at-now" class="headerlink" title="Where is the project at now?"></a>Where is the project at now?</h2><p>This is literally my first post that&#x2019;s using the tag <code>scottest</code> which is SCOT test.  It&#x2019;s not live on the main production site now.  We&#x2019;re still on the test servers.  So, no, you can&#x2019;t start today, but we&#x2019;re going live with testing as of right now!  Hopefully before the end of May everyone who wants one can get their own community started.</p>
<p>The project is moving in iterative steps from centralized to decentralized as it&#x2019;s progressing.  Right now we&#x2019;re running the SCOT distribution features through essentially a python voting bot, which is a centralized service that is controlled by individual devs and project owners.  As we get this nailed down and working correctly we&#x2019;ll also implement a way to have the same distribution handled by smart contract through Steem-Engine.  We&#x2019;ll let both options exist, but the smart contract version reduces the amount of trust needed in the leaders for the project to be successful.</p>
<h2 id="How&#x2019;s-it-work"><a href="#How&#x2019;s-it-work" class="headerlink" title="How&#x2019;s it work?"></a>How&#x2019;s it work?</h2><p>Steem-Engine is a layer 2 solution facilitating proof of brain distribution.  Data is stored on the main chain through custom json operations that are added to the main chain by witnesses as users submit actions.  Steem as a blockchain has no idea what any of the Steem-Engine transactions mean, but the blockchain can make sure that all the data provided is validated by consensus.  Any standard Steem block that has transactions that are regarding Steem-engine are picked up and put into a separate chain we call a side chain. </p>
<p>Our side chain is literally a subset of transactions that were stored on Steem.  The side chain ignores all but the Steem-Engine relevant transactions.  Then the Steem-Engine node kicks in to read the data that is stored on the side chain, interpret it, and execute on it.  &#x201C;Transfer 17 COOL tokens from aggroed to yabapmatt.&#x201D;  &#x201C;Issue 30 Drama Tokens&#x201D; and other activities are executed by the node.  The node doesn&#x2019;t have a p2p layer beyond the witnesses yet, but before the end of the year we hope to have a fully functioning P2P consensus layer for the Steem-Engine nodes (as opposed to witness nodes) with separate block production and block production rewards.  In the meantime you get pretty close to that by independently running your own node to verify transactions so that you can see we&#x2019;re not randomly adding extra tokens to ourselves.</p>
<p>And yes, the node software is opensource!</p>
<h2 id="Want-to-run-your-own-token-and-build-your-own-community-website"><a href="#Want-to-run-your-own-token-and-build-your-own-community-website" class="headerlink" title="Want to run your own token and build your own community website?"></a>Want to run your own token and build your own community website?</h2><p>We&#x2019;re working on making this as simple as possible.  Some trickiness we can&#x2019;t escape, but it should look something like this and be available in May-</p>
<p>Getting Started<br>Step 1.  Make a token, set some parameters, and work with us get the voting bot working and potentially (optionally) decide to create your own web portal with it<br>Step 2.  Issue tokens to users<br>Step 3.  Users stake tokens<br>Step 4.  Users create posts on regular steem sites (steempeak, busy, steemit, cryptoempirebot) and just use a tag, or they go through your custom website<br>Step 5.  Users vote on each others posts in the normal way, but now they get Steem and other tokens as well!</p>
<h2 id="Why-is-this-a-big-deal"><a href="#Why-is-this-a-big-deal" class="headerlink" title="Why is this a big deal?"></a>Why is this a big deal?</h2><p>SMTs seem infinitely delayed.  They&#x2019;re likely game changing, but it&#x2019;s tough to know how far into the future we&#x2019;d have to wait for them to arrive.  In the meantime everyone can create their own Steemit.com like site with their own tokenonimcs starting sometime in May.  If you don&#x2019;t have a community behind you it may not make a big deal.  If people with communities behind them start forming their own token based community here it&#x2019;ll have a drastic effect towards user acquisition, retention, and community empowerment.</p>
<p>People = Value</p>
<p>We need more people hodling Steem, and this can help get them!</p>
<p>Also, think of whaleshares, peerplays, bearshares, and some of the other chain forks that have happened.  Each time they go off on their own it causes some disruption to the main chain.  Imagine instead of forking all of Steem and moving off to a separate community they instead just issued their own token and stayed right here?  They could get the best of both worlds.  They&#x2019;d still be on Steem which would limit the technical requirements of what they would need to setup a new token, they could still tap into the existing user base instead of starting from scratch, but now they can also get their own token with a distribution that may not be as fucked or be as fucked, but now benefiting new people.</p>
<p>Keeping people in the ecosystem and growing this ecosystem is how we moon.  SCOT facilitates creating and keeping new communities on the blockchain and that to me represents an amazing human growth potential for Steem and crypto as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="Is-there-a-benefit-to-the-layer-2-solution-and-this-whole-side-chain-thing"><a href="#Is-there-a-benefit-to-the-layer-2-solution-and-this-whole-side-chain-thing" class="headerlink" title="Is there a benefit to the layer 2 solution and this whole side chain thing?"></a>Is there a benefit to the layer 2 solution and this whole side chain thing?</h2><p>The three biggest positives are timeline to readiness, not requiring Steem hardforks to make changes, and smart contract flexibility.</p>
<p>Speed:  I&#x2019;d like to think SMTs would have already been here, but they aren&#x2019;t.  I&#x2019;d like to think they might get formed this year, but I have my doubts.  Every day it seems Steem is slipping a little more on the rankings, and that&#x2019;s bad for price and community size.  Getting launched now puts us ahead of any other blockchain in terms of being able to really create a community that you own through tokenization.  It also removes some of the bad behavior seen on steem or bad actors.  Bad actors likely aren&#x2019;t going to interact much with your posts because they may not receive much steem, but they&#x2019;ll be worth tons of tokens so hopefully they&#x2019;ll be ignored by some of the usual suspects  We need growth and we need it now.  This gets us going.</p>
<p>Hardforks:  If SMTS are built onto the steem blockchain itself then serious changes are going to require hardforks of STEEM.  A hardfork is a particularly scary time.  Not all of the exchanges are good at handling them, and as a consequence any time they come around we risk being offline with some of the major exchanges for days, weeks, or months.  We could also end up with a stopped chain for a while as has happened before.  All of that is bad for the price of Steem and subsequently the activity on it.  If every time the community wants changes to SMTs we have to hardfork it then that&#x2019;s going to cause challenges to getting changes put into the system and changes when they are put into the system.</p>
<p>When we&#x2019;re on a side chain we can hardfork the side chain without worrying as much about the exchanges.  After we make more headway we&#x2019;ll create exchange nodes that the exchanges can run so they can trade our coins, but at the moment we don&#x2019;t have to worry about it.  This gives us some flexibility to grow and change the way the tool works without major disruptions to the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>Smart Contracts:  SMTs are essentially a smart contract for distributing tokens.  It&#x2019;s pretty robust, but it reminds me of the Henry Ford Quote about the Model T: &#x201C;it comes in whatever color you want so long as that color is black.&#x201D; Essentially, it&#x2019;s a robust tool, but it can do exactly one set of things.  We&#x2019;re instead creating a smart contract platform that has the potential to respond to any if:then statement and create logic around it.  We can replicate SMTs as we&#x2019;re doing now, but we don&#x2019;t have to stop there.  We can create other contracts and do so faster than the Steem blockchain can be changed.</p>

<h2 id="TRX-Tournament-Integration"><a href="#TRX-Tournament-Integration" class="headerlink" title="TRX Tournament Integration"></a>TRX Tournament Integration</h2><p>As part of our crowdfunding campaign through the SEEDGerminator platform on the Tron blockchain, we are working on integrating TRX and other Tron-based cryptocurrencies into the game.</p>
<p>We have recently released the ability to use TRX for tournament entry fees and as prizes which will be handled automatically by the system. In order to enter a tournament with TRX or other Tron-based tokens as prizes, each entrant must have a Tron wallet address linked to their Splinterlands account. This will allow the system to automatically pay out the prizes to each winner when the tournament ends or refund entry fees if a player leaves or if the tournament is cancelled.</p>
<p>To link your Tron wallet address to your account, you can click on your name on the top right of the game page and choose the &#x201C;Link Tron Wallet&#x201D; option in the drop down. If you are using a browser-based wallet such as the TronLink extension, your address will be pre-filled for you.</p>
<h2 id="Pay-with-TRX-on-the-Market"><a href="#Pay-with-TRX-on-the-Market" class="headerlink" title="Pay with TRX on the Market"></a>Pay with TRX on the Market</h2><p>Additionally, we have recently released the option to <strong>purchase cards on the market from other players using TRX</strong>. Sellers will still be paid in STEEM, even if the buyer pays with TRX. Behind the scenes the TRX is simply converted to STEEM. It is necessary to pay the seller in STEEM because, as a decentralized market on the Steem blockchain, the actual STEEM transfer on the blockchain is what completes the transaction.</p>
<p>Allowing players to make market purchases using other cryptocurrencies should make it MUCH easier for those who don&#x2019;t already have STEEM to participate in the market which we hope will help increase prices and liquidity.</p>
<h2 id="New-Rulesets"><a href="#New-Rulesets" class="headerlink" title="New Rulesets"></a>New Rulesets</h2><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IFdhZVj.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Last week you may have noticied two new rulesets added into the game: Little League, and Fog of War. Earlier today we released another new ruleset called Earthquake. Going forward we hope to release a new ruleset every week or so to help keep things interesting. We also plan to make the new rulesets appear more often so that more players have the chance to try them out.</p>
<p>In case you haven&#x2019;t encountered these new rulesets yet, here&#x2019;s what they do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Little League</strong> - Only Monsters &amp; Summoners that cost 4 Mana or less may be used in battles.</li>
<li><strong>Fog of War</strong> - Monsters lose the Sneak and Snipe abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Earthquake</strong> - Non-flying Monsters take 2 Melee damage at the end of each round.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="New-Promo-Card-Stats"><a href="#New-Promo-Card-Stats" class="headerlink" title="New Promo Card Stats"></a>New Promo Card Stats</h2><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BkKtV0J.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We had previously released the stats for the Red Dragon and Dragonling Bowman cards, and now we are releasing the stats for the two remaining exclusive promo cards which will ONLY be available through the SEEDGerminator crowdfunding campaign!</p>
<h3 id="Delwyn-Dragonscale"><a href="#Delwyn-Dragonscale" class="headerlink" title="Delwyn Dragonscale"></a>Delwyn Dragonscale</h3><p>Let&#x2019;s start off with the new <strong>Common Summoner - Delwyn Dragonscale</strong>. He is the only Common rarity Summoner card currently in the game, which means he will comprise the bulk of the cards given out during the campaign. Our hope is that it will be pretty easy for all players to get at least one of this card so they can access the Dragon Splinter, but it will still remain difficult / costly to get him up to higher levels.</p>
<p>You have probably already noticed that he costs a hefty 5 Mana, but he also gives all friendly Monsters +1 Magic attack. This is a pretty big deal as Magic attack is the most powerful attack in the game since it bypasses Armor and cannot miss. Previously only available to the Water Splinter, now with Delwyn a +1 Magic attack Summoner is available to be used with cards from ANY Splinter!</p>
<p>In a high Mana-cap game, pairing him with a Red and Gold Dragon could be extremely deadly! Best get your Silence, Magic Reflect, and Void cards ready to counter him.</p>
<h3 id="Fiendish-Harpy"><a href="#Fiendish-Harpy" class="headerlink" title="Fiendish Harpy"></a>Fiendish Harpy</h3><p>Next we&#x2019;ll talk about the new <strong>Epic Monster - Fiendish Harpy</strong>. The Harpy costs only 2 Mana and has the following new ability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opportunity</strong> - This Monster targets the enemy with the least health</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that the Harpy can use its Melee attack from any position on the battlefield, and will target whichever enemy Monster has the least Health at the time. We expect that this will add a new element to the meta where there is now a way to &#x201C;pick off&#x201D; low health support or damage dealers. At 2 Mana, this card should fit in nicely to many teams, especially in low mana cap battles.</p>
<h2 id="Crowdfund-Campaign-Ending-Soon"><a href="#Crowdfund-Campaign-Ending-Soon" class="headerlink" title="Crowdfund Campaign Ending Soon!"></a>Crowdfund Campaign Ending Soon!</h2><p>If you want to pick up some of these exclusive cards, there is less than one week left before the first campaign ends! You can find the details of the campaign and how to contribute at <a href="https://seedgerminator.sesameseed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://seedgerminator.sesameseed.org/</a></p>
<p>Even if you don&#x2019;t really care about the exclusive cards, if you contribute using TRX you can <strong>get regular Beta edition booster packs at around a 20% discout AND you get some of the new exclusive promo cards as a bonus</strong>!</p>

<p>Have you dreamed of raising millions of dollars for your business?  Do you have a vision, a product, or a company that could use a capital lift?  Do you think it&#x2019;s helpful that blockchain businesses typically raise money at a 7-10x revenue valuation instead of a 2-3x revenue valuation?</p>
<p><code>click here to find out more: https://sto.steem-engine.com/#/launch</code></p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re answering yes to those questions it&#x2019;s time to consider a token launch!  Generally speaking as someone familiar but who is not an attorney; there are two types of tokens: security and utility.  Security tokens exist when you&#x2019;re selling equity in your business, when you&#x2019;re sharing profits, and when you&#x2019;re planning on offering a use case for a token after the money has been raised.  These are called security tokens for a reason.  <em>They are legally classified as securities!</em>  In the US the Securities and Exchange commission regulates securities even if they are tokens.  <strong>If you&#x2019;d like to sell a security without threat of fines or prison then you either have to go through a full registration or use one of the exemptions.</strong></p>
<p>A full registration and an IPO (initial public offering) can cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars to put together and comes with major regulatory burdens.  There are a handful of exceptions to that, which the SEC carved out that you can legally participate in: Reg D 506(b), Reg D 506(c), Reg D 504, Reg CF (Crowd Fund), Reg S (non-US offering).</p>
<h2 id="Services"><a href="#Services" class="headerlink" title="Services"></a>Services</h2><p>The Steem-Engine team is now helping businesses form on the blockchain by providing legal services.  You can incorporate your business and get your security registered.  There are some state and country costs for just about any activity.  Generally speaking, setting up a business in the US will cost under $2000, setting up a business in some tax friendly countries will cost under $8000, and getting your security token to be approved with one of the exemptions will cost just under $10,000.  Once the Security has been sold you&#x2019;re then on a timer to pay various states fees they collect which are roughly $300 per state but vary from zero dollars to $1500.  Again, you don&#x2019;t have to pay that until after you&#x2019;ve successfully raised money in one of those states and these fees can be minimized through smart planning.</p>
<p>Why is it worth ~$10,000 in legal costs to do this?  Because you have the ability to raise millions of dollars from the crypto space.  While I think the time of &#x201C;here&#x2019;s a random token let&#x2019;s shower it with millions&#x201D; is over I do think blockchain businesses that have a business plan, are profitable, and have a growing user base are going to be able to rack up millions especially as the next bull market takes hold.</p>
<h2 id="Now&#x2019;s-the-time-to-build"><a href="#Now&#x2019;s-the-time-to-build" class="headerlink" title="Now&#x2019;s the time to build"></a>Now&#x2019;s the time to build</h2><p>You don&#x2019;t want to wait until the bull run is in full swing to get your business launched.  Ask any surfer out there, you should be paddling out in front of the wave if you want to catch it.  You don&#x2019;t just wait until it&#x2019;s already at it&#x2019;s maximum height to then start to catch it.  So, if you&#x2019;re planning a business, a game, a service, or financial offerings it&#x2019;s time to get ahead of the bull run and get your business squared away.</p>
<p>You can find more detailed information here : <a href="https://sto.steem-engine.com/#/launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://sto.steem-engine.com/#/launch</a></p>
<p>I look forward to bringing many new blockchain businesses into the world.</p>
<h2 id="PS-VISION-FOR-STEEM-ENGINE"><a href="#PS-VISION-FOR-STEEM-ENGINE" class="headerlink" title="PS VISION FOR STEEM ENGINE"></a>PS VISION FOR STEEM ENGINE</h2><p>The plan is to make steem-engine.com the number one destination on the web to launch your STO, ICO, IEO.  We have a ways to go to get there, but we&#x2019;re working on a few tools to help businesses and investors find common ground.</p>
<ol>
<li>Voluntary KYC for those wanting to invest in securities.  While using the DEX doesn&#x2019;t require KYC participating in an STO will.  We&#x2019;ll provide centralized housing of KYC data to help investors and businesses find each other.</li>
<li>STO-Starter- We&#x2019;re putting together a website to allow newly minted blockchain security companies to showcase their STO to the userbase we&#x2019;re gathering.  This will help them raise more money faster.</li>
<li>Distribution: We&#x2019;re working a couple different tools so that the community can distribute their tokens to people quickly and easily.  These tools will help both on initial launch, and also on an ongoing basis.</li>
