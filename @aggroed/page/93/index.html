<p>So, I have a camera, mic, lights, computer, desk, editing program, and just about everything else I need to get PAL-studios going except a space and a TV for a back set.  I&#x2019;ve been a little dead set on a space a town over that&#x2019;s got high walls and such, but it turns out the land lord isn&#x2019;t my favorite human.  He&#x2019;s a pretty tough business man to deal with and he wants me to sign a year long lease for double what his sales guy initially offered to me.  I&#x2019;m not thrilled&#x2026;</p>
<p>So, while looking at insurance (because he requires that) I visit my insurance agent for the last few years and it turns out he owns the building, has some extra space, doesn&#x2019;t need a long term contract, and will charge me $200 less and include internet for me.  He&#x2019;s also a really nice guy.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of ladies that work next door that were loud enough and chatty enough that it came through the studio space, but at least for now I&#x2019;m not that worried because I&#x2019;ll likely just start by filming only after 5pm when they&#x2019;ve all left the building.  The space is about 20 min from my current house and a 2 min walk from my last home, which part of me still thinks of as home.</p>
<p>So, I&#x2019;m waiting on that paperwork, but I think I should have a lease done this week, get a TV installed next week, and start shooting videos by mid February.  If it takes off, I love it, and I can find more people to shoot there then things will likely pick up.  I imagine starting just with my talking head videos, but with a TV set as the background we could just change the image and KAPOW brand new show.</p>
<h2 id="Equipment"><a href="#Equipment" class="headerlink" title="Equipment "></a>Equipment </h2><h2></h2><p>For anyone that cares here&#x2019;s some of what I&#x2019;ve got so far-</p>
<p>SONY FDR AX100 4k camera<br>64gb sd card<br>i7 computer withe Nividia TI 1080 graphics card, additional RAM<br>Adobe Premiere Elements<br>Adobe Photoshop Elements<br>2 500W LED lights<br>a desk from Ikea<br>2 stools from Ikea</p>
<p>Still on my list are a lease, a 70&#x201D; TV, and a wall mount for it.</p>
<p>Whole thing is probably going to be around 7-8k to start, and $6k for the year.  </p>
<h2 id="Space"><a href="#Space" class="headerlink" title="Space "></a>Space </h2><h2></h2><p>The room is probably 24 x 12 with 10&#x2019; high ceilings.  It&#x2019;s a little echo-y and the lights hums when they are on.  We&#x2019;ll see what I need to do to make it suitable.  I&#x2019;m confidant it&#x2019;ll be a good place to work especially since it&#x2019;s only a few hundred bucks and helps me get my sea legs under me.</p>

I&#x2019;m looking to get a 30 second graphic that would be really cool.  I&#x2019;m eventually going to model my show off of the Daily Show or Corbert Report (show format not their politics).  I think it needs a cool as intro.  I&#x2019;m not sure what that would be.  It probably has to flash the words Peace, Abundance, and Liberty up there, maybe show some harm that government causes through recent news clips, flash up some crypto headlines, and then put up an as of yet unmade logo.</p>

<p>Money is constantly sloshing around within the cryptosphere.  There&#x2019;s lots of volume and the prices are volatile.  For many this represents sheer financial terror as the only certain thing is that crypto has almost no certainty in price.   For others it&#x2019;s an opportunity to use trading to grow one&#x2019;s wealth. </p>
<h2 id="It-could-fit"><a href="#It-could-fit" class="headerlink" title="It could fit "></a>It could fit </h2><h2></h2><p>If you have a few hundred, a few thousand, or even more dollars and have some fears of where to park it where you can potentially earn some amazing gains then crypto could be a good home for your money.  While other traditional investments have a million people in this country eager to help you manage the ropes it&#x2019;s still fairly difficult to find someone that can show you the ropes in crypto trading.</p>
<h2 id="The-Topic"><a href="#The-Topic" class="headerlink" title="The Topic "></a>The Topic </h2><h2></h2><p>So, I present to you a panel of relatively small scale investors who can take an average person through what it looks like to trade reasonable sums of money on centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, bring it in and out through fiat and all explore some of the tools and approaches that are available to investors.</p>
<p>This is part panel discussion and part training session on what steps are necessary to trade and what resources are available to traders to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>This isn&#x2019;t to necessarily sell you on anything.  It&#x2019;s to inform you so you can make better decisions for what is in your best financial future.  Any crypto tips or trading advice is strictly personal information and bias by participants.  The point isn&#x2019;t to tell you what to invest in, but more about how to invest in cryptos if you choose to do so.</p>
<h2 id="Hosts"><a href="#Hosts" class="headerlink" title="Hosts "></a>Hosts </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;ll be joined by a few panel members to add some suggestions and places they go while making trades.</p>
<p>I have three  panelists confirmed:  @followbtcnews, @scaredycatguide and @choogirl.  I have two others invited that I&#x2019;ll update on later.</p>
<p>@followbtcnews is a day trader who moves money throughout the day.  He&#x2019;s a witness that supports the Minnow Support Project.<br>@scaredycatguide runs a radio show all about investing on msp-waves.  He has a book on bitcoin written, and is experienced in the space.<br>@choogirl is an Australian expat who has been living in a crypto tax haven of Panama and living off of her crypto investments.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-Steem-Monsters"><a href="#What-is-Steem-Monsters" class="headerlink" title="What is Steem Monsters "></a>What is Steem Monsters </h2><h2></h2><p>I started making a game almost four years ago.  I actually had a kickstarter that went pretty well.  I raised 20k for my game and started thinking about additional games I could create.  I had this idea watching my kids argue that they would rip off buttons from their shirts to throw down in front of them to summon monsters to fight for them.  This is the heart of where Steem Monsters was born creatively and Cryptokitties put a block chain business model to it. </p>
<h2 id="Basics"><a href="#Basics" class="headerlink" title="Basics "></a>Basics </h2><h2></h2><p>Our intent is to build a game where you&#x2019;re the Dominus of a Monster Gladiator Stable.  You have summoners that can summon monsters and monsters that can fight.  There will be a series of matches per day.  You&#x2019;ll choose a summoner, a monster, and weight class to fight in.  Higher weight classes will have better prizes.  There are things like equipment and spells to gear up your monsters and summoners.</p>
<h2 id="Phases"><a href="#Phases" class="headerlink" title="Phases "></a>Phases </h2><h2></h2><ol>
<li>Pre-Sale (guarenteed legendaries available)</li>
<li>Beastiary- See all of the monsters  </li>
<li>Items and trading- See your inventory, equip your gear, and trade the cards and inventory in a marketplace.</li>
<li>Plan your fights- Choose your monsters, summoners, and weight classes that you will enter them in.</li>
<li>Monsters will fight and earn you prizes for winning.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Timeline"><a href="#Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Timeline "></a>Timeline </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m doing the best we can with the physical and personal resources I have available.  It&#x2019;s movin&#x2019;.  Pre-sale next week.  And a working fighting tournament system by year&#x2019;s end.  Hopefully sooner.  </p>
<h2 id="Prices"><a href="#Prices" class="headerlink" title="Prices "></a>Prices </h2><h2></h2><p>We&#x2019;re targeting 1 steem per deck of 5 cards.  40 steem for 50 decks of 5 cards and a guaranteed legendary dragon.</p>
<p>How&#x2019;s that sound?</p>

<p>While there were many great conversations on the Minnow Mayor Town Hall last night I want to highlight two very cool conversations.  The first one is with @timcliff.  We spend over an hour talking about converting steem to sbd as part of a new hardfork.  We don&#x2019;t agree on when to implement, but I do think eventually it&#x2019;s a good call (I think we need to be bigger or have some other external things happen at first).  We talk about new user experience and what it&#x2019;s like to be a witness.  I find Tim especially charming, smart, and kind spirited and credit him as my Witness mentor.</p>
<p>This starts about 90 min in.  The second really fun interview is with @theywillkillyou and @world5list.  These guys run two YouTube channels that collectively have 1.8M subs.  They are also starting a crypto trading channel.  It&#x2019;s fun to hear them talk about Steem.  They both seem jazzed about the creative outlet that this platform provides.  @theywillkillyou even got his mom in the audience!!!  So, this feels like a point of pride and @world5list was talking about really feeling more passioante about the creative process again.  YouTube is feeling more business these days and more corporate.  On Steem he feels more able to pursue content that interests him.</p>
<p>This next convo starts around 2:15 into the show.  I&#x2019;m happy to interview 3 new steemians!  @erinn @zoeyartanddesign @ruckuschica are all members of the &#x201C;Unfuckers&#x201D; started by my friend @daniarnold.  We talk some about conspiracies and how we can change the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/pNpR6Iz5ndg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://youtu.be/pNpR6Iz5ndg</a></p>
<p>@isaria channels her inner Kubby!!!  We talk about hosting a Live Steem Music performance!<br>starts at the 7 min mark.  @clayboyn reads a love poem&#x2026; but to whom?<br>@teamsteem runs a celebrity look alike contest.  Seth Rogan, Louis CK, and Lotni &#x201C;Sloth&#x201D; Fratelli from Goonies (the mutant) all won.<br>around the 16min mark @r0nd0n and I talk about our experience earlier that day looking at the GEET system.  We talk about next steps.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m looking into getting a user Generator that&#x2019;s about 10-20k Watts to start powering a breaker or my house itself.</p>

<p>On the Minnow Mayor Town Hall I invited David Pantone and Remy Marco to speak about a &#x201C;GEET&#x201D; engine. The claims of the GEET engine are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It creates a high temperature front and a low temperature front</li>
<li>Those fronts meet at a metal or glass rod</li>
<li>The rod ionizes essentially from static electricity</li>
<li>The fuel mixture running over the ionized rod will create a plasma and the fuel undergoes electrolysis.  In the case of water it creates hydrogen gas.</li>
<li>The standard internal combustion engine burns some combination of gasoline vapors, hydrogen gas, and oxygen.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="I-was-convinced-enough-to-try-some-more-experiments"><a href="#I-was-convinced-enough-to-try-some-more-experiments" class="headerlink" title="I was convinced enough to try some more experiments "></a>I was convinced enough to try some more experiments </h2><h2></h2><p>From what I saw and heard I am convinced enough to buy a generator, put it on my property, and try to measure efficiency, fuel use, output, and other metrics.</p>
<p>The main thing I heard that convinced me was how when there was an electric draw on the RV I could hear the generator react.  Both R0n and I were convinced the RV was pulling a load on the generator.</p>
<p>The main thing I saw that convinced me was after he took the rod out of the GEET engine the rod displayed some truly bizarre magnetic behavior.  I can&#x2019;t underscore this enough.  It was bizarre!  He took the rod out and the rod was ionized.  You can tell because a compass would realign to face N or S depending on which pole of the rod he was measuring.  That&#x2019;s weird because there&#x2019;s nothing about combustion that would make me think it would ionize a rod.  More importantly though is that the magnetic properties of the rod were weird.  The part of the rod furtherst from the Earth was the North pole.  If he flipped the rod upside down the pole of the rod shifted.  That&#x2019;s weird!</p>
<h2 id="Magnetic-pole-shifts-like-that-aren&#x2019;t-normal"><a href="#Magnetic-pole-shifts-like-that-aren&#x2019;t-normal" class="headerlink" title="Magnetic pole shifts like that aren&#x2019;t normal "></a>Magnetic pole shifts like that aren&#x2019;t normal </h2><h2></h2><p>Consider a big red horseshoe magnet for a second.   The orientation to the earth doesn&#x2019;t change which pole is which.  I can move it however and those atoms are locked in place.  The field around the magnet changes as I rotate it, but the North Pole and South Pole don&#x2019;t just switch sides.  The pole on this rod changed due to orientation to the earth.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m not sure what causes that.  I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever seen that behavior before.  It was much less prevalent on the glass rod than on the metal rod, but if you squint it might be present.  Tough to know from one short test.  As a chemist I can&#x2019;t think of what would cause this.  My best guess is that there are particles on the surface of the rod that get ionized and are mobile.  Presumably the negative ones are slightly heavier and when the rod is rotated they move towards the bottom of the rod and the electrostatic interactions push the positive ones up.  I don&#x2019;t know that for sure, but that would be my leading hypothesis because I don&#x2019;t know of other rigid metal magnets that are able to switch poles by changing orientation to the Earth.</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t think things that gets ionized from static electricity will usually have a rotating pole like this.  I have more research to do.</p>
<p>So, the plan:</p>
<p>R0n is an electrician and we&#x2019;ll work to hook up an external generator to my house.  Remy will modify that generator using a couple hundred bucks worth of parts from a machine shop and Home Depot to convert it to a GEET engine.  We&#x2019;ll either run a separate load of some heaters and ASIC miners to test it or we&#x2019;ll run the house on the generator.  I&#x2019;ll try to measure the amount of fuel consumed and see if I can get a baseline of information.  Then we&#x2019;ll get Remy to GEET &#x2018;er done and measure the delta in performance and consumption.  </p>
<p>The most likely worst case scenario is I have a new generator that I just took out of warranty (which maybe means I should try to find an old generator off of Craig&#x2019;s list) by modifying it.  Best case scenario I help spread a technology that converts water into electricity using fairly inexpensive equipment and cheap fuel.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;ll see?!?!?!?!?</p>

<p>Good Morning!  I&#x2019;m excited to report that in 11hrs from now @timcliff, @theywillkillyou, and @world5list will all be on the Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  The show starts at 8pm est 0100 UTC.</p>
<p>@timcliff if one of the Top Witnesses on the platform.  A Witness is a server that builds the blockchain and the person who runs it.  The Witnesses provide technical and social services to the platform and Tim does both.  He&#x2019;s constantly helping people on steemit.chat and he&#x2019;s known for putting together projects with large scope to look for ways to improve the blockchain from user experience and then get them implemented.  We&#x2019;ll spend some time talking about the blockchain as a whole and probably diving into some certain topics which may or may not include the conversion of Steem back in SBD.</p>
<p>@theywillkillyou and @world5list manage two youtube channels by the same name with a combined 1.8M subscribers.  They are on a Steem fueled kick to reimagine some of the content they produce, how they monitize, and get back to stories that YouTube would demonetize, but Steem will make sure they get paid for.  It&#x2019;s an exciting time to watch how successful YouTubers even with 5 years+ of history on YouTube can see brighter pathways forward.</p>
<h2 id="Panel-Discussions"><a href="#Panel-Discussions" class="headerlink" title="Panel Discussions "></a>Panel Discussions </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m getting ready to announce a February line up of Forums/Panel Discussions.  This is highly subject to change.</p>
