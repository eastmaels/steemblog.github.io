<p>Maybe you&#x2019;ve heard this phrase before.  If you haven&#x2019;t it&#x2019;s an older expression that essentially means &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll give you 10 to 1 odds that I&#x2019;m right.&#x201D;  That&#x2019;s because donuts used to be ~10 cents each.</p>
<p>If you go into a Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts right now and order a doughnut you&#x2019;ll notice that a doughnut is often times more expensive than a dollar.  Some of the fancy ones are 1.29 or more.  What gives?  Did the value of a doughnut suddenly rise up to a person?  Is there doughnut scarcity that&#x2019;s driving the price up?  How could it possibly be that this simple little doughnut in the course of 1-2 generations is now 10x more expensive than it used to be???</p>
<h2 id="The-Federal-Reserve"><a href="#The-Federal-Reserve" class="headerlink" title="The Federal Reserve"></a>The Federal Reserve</h2><p>You might not know how money is made in this country.  If you look at a dollar bill it says it&#x2019;s a federal reserve note.  The word note means debt.  It&#x2019;s an IOU.  The Federal Reserve doesn&#x2019;t actually mean it&#x2019;s a dejure part of the government.  It&#x2019;s a private company with shareholders.  The word Federal is there to throw you off the scent and make you think it&#x2019;s part of the USA, but it isn&#x2019;t.  It&#x2019;s private like Walmart or Facebook.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZb39Tvzim3UM1Ny8NsPU3SoJ6CnTekPP8eKrrTFFzMis/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Federal Reserve prints money.  They do it whenever they want.  Alan Greenspan came (the main piece is at 7:50 in this segment) and said the Federal Reserve is accountable to no one.  They are above the law.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol3mEe8TH7w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol3mEe8TH7w</a></p>
<p>That&#x2019;s never been more evident than when in 2008 the federal reserve printed around 20T dollars and then gave it mostly to foreign banks.  To put that in comparison&#x2026; every working man and woman working for a full year generate around the same amount of money.  So, they took the collective work of a nation of 300M people and simply typed that much money into a computer screen and then handed it out to foreigners.</p>
<h2 id="Yeah-but-who-cares"><a href="#Yeah-but-who-cares" class="headerlink" title="Yeah, but who cares?"></a>Yeah, but who cares?</h2><p>You should.  This is why your doughnuts are more expensive than a dollar rather than 10 doughnuts to 1 dollar.  This is why it costs hundreds now to fill up your grocery cart.  This is why everything seems so expensive compared to when your parents had to do the same things.</p>
<p>They inflate the money, they get the benefit, and you&#x2019;re holding the bags.</p>
<h2 id="Yeah-but-I-already-know-this-aggy"><a href="#Yeah-but-I-already-know-this-aggy" class="headerlink" title="Yeah, but I already know this aggy!"></a>Yeah, but I already know this aggy!</h2><p>Right, but here&#x2019;s your homework.  Try to have this conversation with 1 normie at least once a month.  Try to get them thinking about where does the value of money come from.  Let&#x2019;s see if we can&#x2019;t convert some more folks away from fiat.</p>

<p>Some people see Trump&#x2019;s facial impression like hes leaning into this chart like a mold while facing right.  I see a sharp spike $989,350 to $1,292,550.  That&#x2019;s a marketcap rise of $303,200 in the last month!  That&#x2019;s a marketcap rise of over 30%!</p>
<p>A part of this that makes me pretty happy is to see that Monsters isn&#x2019;t completely coupled to the price of Steem.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/aggroed/MK6QBq8P-image.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Steem Monsters marketcap has been kicking ass for the last week where as the price of Steem has dropped from a recent high of 58 cents down to 48 cents or so.  So, without a doubt a price increase in Steem helps the Steem Monsters ecosystem, but the two aren&#x2019;t perfect correlated meaning that people that buy Steem Monsters aren&#x2019;t making all their financial decisions for their cards simply on the price of Steem.  That&#x2019;s healthy for us!!!</p>

<p>So, my last show has had some weird things happening to it, so my saturday night show is getting a little bit of a make over.  We&#x2019;ll do some improv comedy and music tonight.  It&#x2019;s not really socially acceptable, but that&#x2019;s half the fun and the source of much of the comedy.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;d like to participate on air as a comedian doing improv just hop into the channel.  If you&#x2019;re just looking for a good thing to do on a boring saturday night come into PALnet through minnowpond.org or listen via mspwaves.com.</p>
<p>Should be fun!</p>

<p>Stars Align is a proposal for the community to consider for a non-profit organization on the Steem blockchain with a primary purpose of mainstreaming the Steem blockchain.  </p>
<p>In order to mainstream the blockchain we have to consider two major components: carbon based lifeforms and silicon chips.  This proposal is designed to allow the general Steem public to request funding from the non-profit and then use that in a variety of ways to mainstream the Steem Blockchain.  </p>
<p>The general structure works like this:  We&#x2019;ll have 5 &#x201C;Topical Boards&#x201D; that are organized by the &#x201C;Executive Board&#x201D; and decisions are approved by the &#x201C;Board of Directors.&#x201D;  The public will present requests for funding to the Topical Boards, if approved they&#x2019;ll be merged into a common budget with oversight by the Executive Board, and then presented to the Board of Directors for approval.  This way people with expertise can review the requests, a team of administrators can ensure it&#x2019;s all above board and working to mainstream Steem, and the stakeholders that are on the Board of Directors get final approval.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmcgEaudLKgGvetg8z1EXdNEBq5Sgy3jkbakQZ7X9XjdeN/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Purpose: </strong> Mainstream the Steem blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Benefits</strong>: This structure is designed to promote Steem to people and improve the underlying technology to ensure we have the best tech available in a highly competitive space.</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>: to allow the general public to have access to funds through a competitive approval process from a team of domain experts to make sure projects are vetted, have oversight, and people are held accountable for delivering on promises.</p>
<p><strong>Organization Structure</strong>: The off chain structure will be a very simple 501-C3 non-profit in the USA.  The on chain/Discord structure will comprise of 5 Topical Boards which can approve funding requests to be reviewed for the budget, a Board of Directors that helps organize all goals and formally set a budget, and a Board of Directors with authority to approve presented budgets.</p>
<p><strong>Foundation membership</strong>: this doc goes into more detail: <a href="https://hackmd.io/WpsItvpTS06mmKA2CIS82w?view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://hackmd.io/WpsItvpTS06mmKA2CIS82w?view</a><br>Initally we&#x2019;ll launch by populating the Executive Board with members of the first and second working group.  They&#x2019;ll be tasked with getting a polling solution similar to witness voting that will allow the public to apply for the various boards and the Stake Holders to vote for them.  There will be 11 members of each Topical Board and the Executive Board.  There will be 21 members of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Roles</strong>: each Board will have a Chair, Vice Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, and Liason.  Chair will set the agenda, Vice Chair fills in for other roles if they are vacant for any period, Secretary will be tasked for communication from the Board, Treasurer will handle financial transaction on behalf of the Board, and a Liason will be picked from each Topical Board each Topical Board to serve on the Executive Board to ensure each Topical Board is represented in budget setting.</p>
<p><strong>Community Involvement:</strong> The general public has the ability to run a campaign to serve on any of the boards.  They also have the ability to present requests for funding to the board.  Communication is built into the role of secretary for broadcasting, and set weekly meeting times of Board to make sure that community members can be heard.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability</strong>:  There are ways to remove bad actors from the various boards.  There are community guidelines included in the structure designed to allow other members to enforce rules and standards.  Voting is public and always available.  If people act in bad ways the community can unvote them from the role.</p>
<p>Fiat Legal Structure: Non-profit house in the USA to allow for funding in the USA.</p>
<p>Foundation Funding:  The startup funding is hopefully provided by Steemit Inc either through direction donation or by working with the Blocktrades DAO.  Once funding is setup the goal is to ensure that all the activities that are supported with funding provide benefit back to the Stars Align foundation.  Focusing on low interest loans, upvotes, grants, delegations, and equity deals for start up funding can ensure that the project is well funded.  Additionally, the DAO can be requested for funds and individuals or outside corporations can contribute.</p>
<p><strong>Project Funding</strong>: As described above this is central to the purspose of the organization and how it&#x2019;s structured.  The public requests funding from Topical Boards for projects that will help mainstream Steem.  Budgets are compiled by the Executive Board and approved by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong>: The Stars Align proposal can get ongoing funding from the DAO, but there are also many communities that operate independantly of one another that can be brought together.  There&#x2019;s PALnet, Helpie, and Steem Onboarding that can help with Community Success and work together on a common purpose.  There is the Steem Communities and witness group that can be approached for blockchain development. The Steem business alliance can be brought into the Business Incubator and Delegation Board to drive business adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: the Stars Align proposal for a non-profit foundation with a purpose of mainstreaming Steem can help the general public take necessary steps for platform growth into our own hands and utilize public funding mechanism to ensure there is leadership and financial incentive for all community members.  By voting the for Stars Align project Steemians will get a project that opens up funding for the general public to mainstream steem through facilitating community involvement, attracting businesses, building the best blockchain technology, growth through marketing, and attracting investors to pour money into the Steem ecosystem.</p>

<p>There have been a couple of stand out moments for me personally while on Steem: PAL reaching over 1,000 community members very quickly, DJing on MSP-Waves, breaking into the top 50 witnesses, making it to witness one, witness forums being successful, Steem Monsters rapidly taking off, and the introduction of Steem Engine are just a few achievements to mention!</p>
<h2 id="This-is-one-of-my-favorite-moments-on-Steem-to-date"><a href="#This-is-one-of-my-favorite-moments-on-Steem-to-date" class="headerlink" title="This is one of my favorite moments on Steem to date!"></a>This is one of my favorite moments on Steem to date!</h2><p>I&#x2019;m so fucking pumped it&#x2019;s unreal.  </p>
<p>Steem-Engine is great and we can mint tokens.  Those tokens are immediately liquid because you can trade all of them against Steem.  That&#x2019;s a great first step, but it isn&#x2019;t the last step by any means.  We have a lot more to do.  </p>
<h2 id="Vision"><a href="#Vision" class="headerlink" title="Vision"></a>Vision</h2><p>I want to make Steem-Engine the place where everyone comes to do their security token offerings in the next crypto bull market.  We&#x2019;ve gotten prices from the law firm to incorporate and setup a legally tradeable Security Tokens and legally raise money through Security Tokens Offerings (STOs).  We&#x2019;ll get those out publicly soon.  </p>
<p>You can already make tokens and trade them against Steem.  <strong>Next up is trading against other cryptos.</strong> Not only will your token be made instantly liquid against steem, but it&#x2019;ll be easily traded against btc, ltc, etc.  THAT&#x2019;S THE DREAM AS A NEW BLOCKCHAIN BUSINESS!!!  </p>
<p>Last, we&#x2019;re planning to help setup the STOs and managing the crowdfunding and distribution of the tokens!</p>
<p><em>Make Steem the number one place to launch legal STOs</em></p>
<h2 id="What-just-happened"><a href="#What-just-happened" class="headerlink" title="What just happened?"></a>What just happened?</h2><p>I reached out to my network to try to find a developer to help us turn Steem-Engine from just it&#x2019;s own world into the larger crypto sphere.  We want a full decentralized exchange.  I&#x2019;ve been working with Privex and Someguy123 for a few years now so he was one of the first places I turned.  He already has a lot of knowledge of the other tokens and he had a lot of off the shelf code to accept payments from bitcoin-esque tokens because he needed it all for anonsteem and privex.</p>
<p>So, he took the last week or two and wrote up an open source coin exchanger!  We coupled that with the Smart Contract platform and we&#x2019;ve been able to successfully convert 1.84 LTC into into 1.83 LTCP (p stands for pegged because that token is pegged 1 to 1 with LTC).  And then convert some back into LTC!</p>
<h2 id="THIS-IS-HUGE"><a href="#THIS-IS-HUGE" class="headerlink" title="THIS IS HUGE!"></a>THIS IS HUGE!</h2><p>This is the first step to getting a complete DEX built on top of Steem with Steem as the main trading pair using Steem Engine!  If you don&#x2019;t think this is bad ass then you&#x2019;re missing the fucking point!  The dream is to make sure that our home is the central place for new STOs to launch and to do that we have to trade against more than just Steem.  We need the other cryptos here, and we just got the first one working!!!</p>
<p>Previously, Steemit has had to run around getting us listed in a million places and we&#x2019;re relying on them to keep us going and trading.  Here it&#x2019;s the oppostite.  WE RUN THE EXCHANGE.  WE ARE THE TRADING PAIR!  We&#x2019;ll run nodes of other coins on Privex servers and we&#x2019;ll trade our tokens against all the other ones!</p>
<p>This is the hometown exchange for all of Steem and it&#x2019;s utility is going up 10x as we finalize the UI for this!</p>
<h2 id="ERC20-TRON20-EOS20-BTS"><a href="#ERC20-TRON20-EOS20-BTS" class="headerlink" title="ERC20, TRON20, EOS20, BTS"></a>ERC20, TRON20, EOS20, BTS</h2><p>There are pretty standard protocols out there for tokens created on other blockchains.  Once we get these other cryptos up and running we&#x2019;ll also be able to host their token networks too.  Have a token on Tron and want it traded on Steem-Engine?  Create a token here and we&#x2019;ll load that into the token converter too.  Every business can bring their token here and run on our exchange traded against every other crypto this community sees fit to run FROM ANY BLOCKCHAIN OUT THERE!</p>
<p>THIS IS FUCKING HUGE!</p>
<h2 id="KYC"><a href="#KYC" class="headerlink" title="KYC"></a>KYC</h2><p>Part of what I hope to host soon through Steem-Engine is us providing a service to handle KYC.  This is a giant pain in the ass for everyone and a complete invasion of our liberty.  It makes raising funds harder for everyone too.  It&#x2019;s argued it&#x2019;s all about stopping criminals, but I&#x2019;d argue it&#x2019;s about ensuring the criminal elite maintain control.  THINK OF THE CHILDREN if people can invest their money how they see fit without government oversight and intervention!!!!</p>
<p>But I digress&#x2026; I want to create a central database of people looking to invest, and clear them for KYC centrally and let all the people making STOs get access, and let all the people offering STOs get their info to potential KYC cleared investors!  It&#x2019;ll be a voluntary action of course, but if an investor wants to share their KYC info with a customer we&#x2019;ll facilitate it!  The investor fills out the form once and can apply it to 100s of new STOs without going through the process 100s of times.  And the small startup business who doesn&#x2019;t have the full reach of an exchange can get access to the network we all collectively build.</p>
<p>THIS HELPS NEW BUSINESSES FORM HERE!!!  Can you see the potential!  Can you see how it all trading against Steem is going to help us all?!?</p>
<h2 id="D-Shift"><a href="#D-Shift" class="headerlink" title="D-Shift"></a>D-Shift</h2><p>If that&#x2019;s not enough the plan is to make a full decentralized tool like shapeshift.  Deposit one token/crypto , leave it on the exchange and/or get a different one out.  We&#x2019;ll be able to do that for things like Steem-Engine tokens or Crypto20 tokens or other cryptos.</p>
<p><em>Decentralized convenience that isn&#x2019;t possible anywhere else on this scale.</em></p>
<h2 id="If-you&#x2019;re-not-pumped-for-Steem-get-pumped-for-Steem"><a href="#If-you&#x2019;re-not-pumped-for-Steem-get-pumped-for-Steem" class="headerlink" title="If you&#x2019;re not pumped for Steem get pumped for Steem"></a>If you&#x2019;re not pumped for Steem get pumped for Steem</h2><p>The backend works.  We&#x2019;re down to some of the last steps of making a UI.  Sometime in early April this whole community can start trading some of the major cryptos on Steem-Engine.  Then we&#x2019;ll work on the ability to issue their crypto20s here too.  This is gonna be awesome!  Get some Steem handy, free up your other coins, and get ready to trade here at home!</p>
<p>PS If you don&#x2019;t vote my witness or stopped voting my witness please consider the value I add to the community and to the Steem you hold and Vote for Aggroed!  Be sure to include @yabapmatt, and @someguy123 as none of this is possible without them!</p>

<p>So, in the Steem Monsters discord we have a bot that calculates what we call the marketcap.  It takes the lowest asking price of a card and multiplies by how many units of that card exist and sums that up for all the cards.  The argument isn&#x2019;t that it&#x2019;s the best or worst way to keep track of the true value&#x2026; it&#x2019;s just 1 consistent number that we use to track how card values are working.</p>
<p>That chart shows that we&#x2019;re just below beating the 90 day high price from back in December.  That&#x2019;s a great recovery especially since bitcoin hasn&#x2019;t really started it&#x2019;s recovery yet.</p>
<p>The trend is your friend and that trend looks great!  I&#x2019;ll keep buying, I made $100 renting cards today, so that was cool.  It&#x2019;s a pain in the ass to rent without the market, but when that gets here I think there&#x2019;s a lot of passive income to be made and apparently I&#x2019;m not the only one who sees that as a possibility!  Clearly other people dig this, have faith in it going up.</p>

<p>3 Steem Monsters related tokens made it into the top 9 most traded tokens on the dex today.</p>
<p>SMALP brinign in $72, Alpha packs are worth $2.34 right now and selling on the market, and Beta packs are currently trading for $1.40.</p>
<p>If you have extra packs and want to sell them convert them to tokens and trade them on steem-engine.com</p>
<p>If you have extra USD and want some packs go ahead and get some packs and any extras you can convert to trade for Steem!</p>
