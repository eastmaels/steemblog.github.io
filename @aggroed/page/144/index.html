        <div class="content">
            <p><a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdragonfrugal.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2Fsteem-2.png&amp;f=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdragonfrugal.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2Fsteem-2.png&amp;f=1</a></p>
<p>A dozen score years ago great leaders of a fledgling nation came together to form the Articles of Confederation as a first step towards self-governance away from a monarchy seeking unethical control of people.  They joined together in their fight against taxation, intolerance, militarization, and all threats to their sovereignty.  They wrote about such things as &#x201C;mutual friendship,&#x201D; &#x201C;free inhabitants,&#x201D; &#x201C;times of peace,&#x201D; and &#x201C;common defense.&#x201D;  There was no president, laws required unanimous votes, it could not enforce laws, states could maintain their own currencies, there was no regulation of commerce, term limits reined in delegates, and the one functioning body could not raise taxes, but simply ask for money from the states.  This was a true vision of independence and a modest role of government as a body to provide a forum for discourse and common defense.</p>
<p>In their lust for power the Constitutional Convention called together representatives of many states and launched the United States of America.  Knowing they could not amend the Articles of Confederation for the bar had been set too high for those men seeking to control others instead wrote a document from scratch and discussed Presidents, Judicial branches, the sole coinage of money, slaves, and did away with term limits.  They took it upon themselves to self declare they had the power to:</p>
<p>borrow money on credit of the United States,<br>Regulate Commerce,<br>Establish uniform Laws,<br>Coin Money,<br>Provide Punishment for Piracies and Felonies,<br>Establish Post Offices,<br>Patent Rights,<br>constitute Tribunals,<br>Declare War,<br>Raise, support, and regulate Armies and a Navy,<br>calling of a Militia to suppress insurrection,<br>Set their seat of governance and defend it with Forts, Magazine, Arsenals, and dock-Yards,<br>To make all Laws which shall be necessary for the Execution the foregoing Powers.</p>
<p>This was an act to lay the ground work of planetary tyranny and the Perpetual Siege of the World.  A nation designed for perpetual war had been crafted and we&#x2019;ve seen the result.  A once peaceful community acting in self defense has been at war 224 years of the 241 years it&#x2019;s existed.  Today is no different excepting that which has lead to greater extremity.  Where peace once ruled now has over 1,000 military bases in foreign nations and military personnel in over 130 countries.  The government is waging an active war in no less than seven countries at once.  We are not at peace, and this nation is the source of war.</p>
<p>Beyond that abject poverty created through purposeful and perpetual creation of money as debt has crippled the vast majority of people on this planet financially leaving a handful of billionaires while billions have only a handful.  We are not abundant while millions of people die of starvation and live in servitude to debt.</p>
<p>And it would seem the era of liberty has passed.  When your speech that conflicts with social norms of the day can lead to your imprisonment, when no less than 40% of your income is stolen to wage war, when millions of non-violent offenders are incarcerated, and when official papers must be presented along with sniffing dogs and armed soldiers at every port we are not free.  We are not free.</p>
<p>But we must refuse to believe that the bank of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty is bankrupt.  We refuse to believe that our great Pact of Humankind is closed for good, nor do we believe that the Universal Spark of the Divine Creator and the Great Collaborator that lies within us all is dead.  Instead we know that our birthright for a peaceful, rich life, where we are free to do as we will so long as we cause no harm is in our hands and has been all along.</p>
<p>We have come to this platform seeking change to the status quo.  We seek to end the unending violence.  We seek to do, say, and be as we see fit so long as we cause no harm, and we seek a life where scarcity cannot be found.  We seek the promise of the American Dream, a house, a family, sustenance, and peace but without the shackles and violence that currently prop it for the handful that can achieve it.</p>
<p>Lady Peace cannot wait.  We cannot lock her out, nor shut her off.  For with each delay we offer there is another life quenched by the machines of war that our forefathers carefully constructed.  So, it&#x2019;s on us to to combat the monster of our past&#x2019;s design.  And let it be that this combat won&#x2019;t be fought with weapons of war, with blood of our family, and through the destruction of our community, but with the ripple of billions of voices simply declaring &#x201C;I do not consent.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I do not consent to violence.<br>I do not consent to taxation.<br>I do not consent to war.<br>I do not consent to poverty.<br>I do not consent to currency as debt.<br>I do not consent to an infinite series of unjust laws.<br>I do not consent to be ruled.</p>
<p>And though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow I hold a Steem.</p>
<p>With my steem, a block-chain currency that can create abundance at a click, I have faith that we can universally achieve our pursuit of property and happiness.</p>
<p>I have a Steem and a hope it will pass between the wallets of peaceful inhabitants of Baghdad and the soldiers who have laid down their arms in peaceful protest.</p>
<p>I have a Steem and a hope it will purchase food for the hungry in the poverty wracked streets of Caracas, Venezuela.</p>
<p>I have a Steem and a hope it will pass between my two daughters and they&#x2019;ll be able to spend it openly and freely without a heavy hand and the threat of a loaded gun if they don&#x2019;t give a piece of that Steem to the state.</p>
<p>I have a Steem today!</p>
<p>I have a Steem today and it comes with a hope that the many brothers and sisters working tirelessly on behalf of a million different projects can usher in a wave of peace so loud it&#x2019;ll be heard from the steps of the white house, the bells of the Vatican, and shatter the glass on the stock tickers in the City of London.</p>
<p>This is the hope I share with many.  This is the faith I have that the swords will become plowshares.  That the spilt blood of &#x201C;the other&#x201D; will be the garden bed of a peaceful world, and that the cacophony of a planet each playing their own instruments to their own liking will in fact harmonize into an incredible orchestra that may uplift and sooth our souls.</p>
<p>And let today be the day.  Where we no longer promise as children in schools to Pledge our Obedience to any state or organization that seeks to rule.</p>
<p>Let today be the day when we stop singing the Battle hymns of any group that perpetuates violence.</p>
<p>Let this be the day when we stop casting body bags and coffins for our sons and daughters who fought one another.</p>
<p>Let this be the day we cease to consent to such things.</p>
<p>If the free inhabitants of the World Wide Web are to be truly free this must be our start!</p>
<p>So let us trade Steem from the oracle of Delphi, to the great wall of China.<br>Let us trade Steem from the Pyramids in Egypt, to the Coasts of South Africa.<br>Let us trade Steem from the Pauper in Pakistan, to the Merchants in Venice.<br>Let us trade Steem from the rolling hills of Pennsylvania to the Peaks of Kilimanjaro .</p>
<p>Not only that but let us post about Liberty from the once controlled streets of North Korea.<br>Let us post about peace from the former barracks of the Soviet Union.<br>Let us post about Abundance from the empty buildings of the BIS in Basel Switzerland.</p>
<p>And when this happens, and when our unhindered trading and free speech can be heard in every village and every hamlet, from every city and town, when people of all faiths and continents can walk hand in hand as brother and sister with a virtual upvote and resteem, may then the former controllers of this world shrink in terror of it&#x2019;s free people, and may a golden age of peace, abundance, and liberty be upon us all.</p>
<p>Today I have Steem.  Tomorrow I hope to trade it with you.</p>

<p>HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT!!!  I can&#x2019;t believe it just happened.  After literally hundreds of hours of work, thousands of answered questions, 140,000 delegated steem power from 200 separate delegations, and growing a 3K person Discord Server it FINALLY HAPPENED!!!!</p>

I&#x2019;m tearing up because I&#x2019;m so stoked to help this community by spreading a very simple message of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty!  I want to growth hack Steemit.  I want to help Minnows grow!  I couldn&#x2019;t be happier that this simple plan is catching hold and this community is responding!</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s a lot of pain on Steemit especially from the new accounts.  To see how we are able to help them and support them have been incredible.  We have people from so many nations, languages, genders, continents, and various planets in there it&#x2019;s incredible to see it all still function.  We have minnows trending, going to STEEMFEST, becoming dolphins, and setting off plans to change the course of this place!</p>
<p>We&#x2019;re gonna hit 4k people by the end of this month, and we&#x2019;re still warming up!!!</p>
<p>MSP has a radio show coming out!</p>
<p>MSP has a website coming out!!!</p>
<p>MSP has a community calendar coming soon!  I mean we are by far the largest off chain Steemit community now!  We have an obligation to help people plan their events and host a central coordination plan!</p>
<h2 id="What-an-incredible-honor"><a href="#What-an-incredible-honor" class="headerlink" title="What an incredible honor!!!

<p>Literally none of this would be possible without the ongoing support of @benjojo and the 195 other delegations to the Minnow Support Project community accounts.  We&#x2019;re honored to have the delegations and I&#x2019;m thankful that you also see the benefit to having 1600 votes per day on the minnows themselves as a wonderful accomplishment!</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;d like to see all of our delegations or you yourself delegation please check out-  <a href="http://mspdelegator.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://mspdelegator.herokuapp.com/</a></p>
<hr>

<p>It&#x2019;s time for another update on the Witness stuff!  Hooray!   I&#x2019;ve got some great news and some bad news that you&#x2019;ve likely been feeling.  So, let&#x2019;s try to lay this stuff out there for you.</p>
<h2 id="The-big-announcement"><a href="#The-big-announcement" class="headerlink" title="The big announcement! "></a>The big announcement! </h2><h2></h2><p>Just received my 400th Witness vote.  The total puts me the tiniest bit away from the top 50 witnesses where the minnows can finally click once and not enter, click off, reenter, reclickoff my name over and over again as they attempt to vote my witness.  It&#x2019;s a big deal.  I&#x2019;m catching roughly 24 blocks a day so one every hour.  It&#x2019;s a giant honor to help assemble the blockchain.  Thanks for your support!  I&#x2019;d list everyone, but 400 people seems a little much ;)</p>
<p>I think my ideals of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, and my promise to growth hack Steemit and help new users continues to resonate, and I&#x2019;ll will continue with that agenda!</p>
<h2 id="1-SEGWIT"><a href="#1-SEGWIT" class="headerlink" title="1.  SEGWIT "></a>1.  SEGWIT </h2><h2></h2><p>yeah, so money stuff first.  You probably noticed some sinking crypto prices around here.  Segwit is on the horizon for August.  Even a Segwit 2 which may happen later if they get their shit together.  It leads to uncertainly, uncertainly increases risk, risk drops price.  So, your crypto assests are sinking.  If you think that segwit will fail and won&#x2019;t integrate like it did with LTC then you should probably sell.  If you think they will be successful then you should probably buy and think of the dip as a sale price.</p>
<h2 id="2-Rewardpool"><a href="#2-Rewardpool" class="headerlink" title="2.  Rewardpool "></a>2.  Rewardpool </h2><h2></h2><p>We&#x2019;re under 800k of steem for the reward pool.  It was over 1.6M during HF18.  It&#x2019;s still sinking.  I&#x2019;m not entirely sure where this place will equilabrate, but it&#x2019;s getting lower.  That&#x2019;s not good.  Especially with so many people upvoting their own comments putting extra drain it seems to keep sinking.  I just wish someone had prominently displayed some concerns over HF19 before it was launched&#x2026; So, for now you&#x2019;ll peak within 24 hrs and unless you&#x2019;re catching late whales to the party expect your rewards to go down until equilibrium is finally achieved.  Between the shrunk pool and Segwit uncertainty it definately hurts me in my dolphin ballz.  Oh, well, don&#x2019;t sell and if price goes back up it won&#x2019;t matter a month from now or so.</p>
<h2 id="3-The-Minnow-Support-Project-should-reach-3-000-people-in-the-discord-Channel-today-or-tomorrow"><a href="#3-The-Minnow-Support-Project-should-reach-3-000-people-in-the-discord-Channel-today-or-tomorrow" class="headerlink" title="3.  The Minnow Support Project should reach 3,000 people in the discord Channel today or tomorrow!!! "></a>3.  The Minnow Support Project should reach 3,000 people in the discord Channel today or tomorrow!!! </h2><h2></h2><p>Yeah, this unreal accomplishment has happened!  It only took us 2 years, scratch that, 1 year, scratch that, 6 months, scratch that, 30 days!  Yep in 30 days we&#x2019;ve hit 3,000 unique users.  We have a website about to be launched thanks to @crimsonclad and @followbtcnews, we have a radio show platform thanks to @sircork and I&#x2019;ll mention that in a second.  We also have 6-8 curation projects running around in the Discord room and overall we&#x2019;ve received roughly 140,000 delegated SP for them from 200 delegations.  It&#x2019;s been pretty insane to watch as roughly every day we get another 1,000 SP delegated or so now.  </p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re interested in delegating to the Minnow Support Projects or it&#x2019;s baby projects please use this app by @netuoso and watch out for the MOAB (mother of all bots) to come out soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://mspdelegator.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://mspdelegator.herokuapp.com/</a></p>
<p>You can also see the 200 delegations that have happened inside the Minnow Support Group.  While it isn&#x2019;t close to half the delegated steem I&#x2019;m pretty sure that half of all delegations on the platform are for MSP related projects!  So, feelin&#x2019; pretty pimp about that!</p>
<h2 id="4-MSPWAVES"><a href="#4-MSPWAVES" class="headerlink" title="4. MSPWAVES "></a>4. MSPWAVES </h2><h2></h2><p>We&#x2019;re building a radio station inside the Minnow Support Project Discord group!  We&#x2019;ll stream through Twitch and put it out into the world!  Should be fun.  We have 300+ Steemians in the channel around the clock now, so hopefully you can come in, rope some up, and put on a show.  You&#x2019;ll get your name out there and hopefully folks will gain some great knowledge.  Check out mspwaves.com and register there.  Once you&#x2019;re promoted to DJ you can self service your time slot and post to the general account @msp-waves.  We&#x2019;ll provide more updates, but the radio shows will start for real in August.  Hopefully you&#x2019;re one of them.</p>
<h2 id="5-Boston-Meetup"><a href="#5-Boston-Meetup" class="headerlink" title="5. Boston Meetup "></a>5. Boston Meetup </h2><h2></h2><p>In case you missed it I&#x2019;m hosting a meetup in Boston with my buddy @justtryme90!  We&#x2019;ll be at knight moves in Brookline on Tuesday August 1st at 6:30pm.  Come join us.  There&#x2019;s over 100 SBD in prizes.  Might also do a delegation while I&#x2019;m there.  We&#x2019;ll see.  Should be fun!</p>
<h2 id="6-HF-20-Velocity"><a href="#6-HF-20-Velocity" class="headerlink" title="6. HF 20: Velocity "></a>6. HF 20: Velocity </h2><h2></h2><p>The steemitblog posted about HF20 almost as soon as they the chain stabilized after HF19.  HF20 will introduce tokens as a way to create new users instead of using steem.  I&#x2019;m totally for that, but it mentioned possibly bringing back mining.  That sounds like a horrible idea to me.  After I wrote the Who is @freedom post I&#x2019;ve been thinking mining is a serious risk to worsening the distribution and technocracy here.  I would think it&#x2019;s better to do a witness style voting thing, but open it up to 2,000 people or so.  Let the block decide who should have the most tokens.  We should ask the witnesses not to participate since they are already getting compensation for what they do on the platform.  I&#x2019;ll take in some feedback from this post before I do a more major piece describing my reaction to it.</p>
<h2 id="In-case-you-missed-it-MSP-sent-siersod-to-STEEMFEST"><a href="#In-case-you-missed-it-MSP-sent-siersod-to-STEEMFEST" class="headerlink" title="In case you missed it MSP sent @siersod to STEEMFEST "></a>In case you missed it MSP sent @siersod to STEEMFEST </h2><h2></h2><p>Be sure to send him some love and congrats!  He wants to work on simplifying the interface for steemit and helping the ongoing food crisis in Venezuela.  2 much needed things for sure!</p>
<h2 id="Witness-settings"><a href="#Witness-settings" class="headerlink" title="Witness settings "></a>Witness settings </h2><h2></h2><p>I haven&#x2019;t changed anything since I put up HF 19.  Yes the price of SBDs has dipped below a dollar.  If it happens or worsens the witnesses will likely react.  It&#x2019;s not an immediate kind of thing though since the market reacts fast and knows we will intervene if we have to.  For now it&#x2019;s stable enough and just being a hair below a $1 isn&#x2019;t enough to freak people out into action&#x2026; yet.</p>
<h2 id="Comments-delayed"><a href="#Comments-delayed" class="headerlink" title="Comments delayed "></a>Comments delayed </h2><h2></h2><p>Going back to work so my comments will be delayed, but I&#x2019;ll read through them tonight and will respond the best I can.  I&#x2019;m grateful for the support of the people that upvote my witness.  I&#x2019;m so effin&#x2019; close to top 50 it&#x2019;s insane.  Please vote for me if you haven&#x2019;t already.  Thanks to the MSP witnesses, mods, delegators, and members.  There are hundreds of you and the growth of the team is a testament to what you do!  </p>
<p>With Love,</p>

<p>@justtryme90 and I are going to host a Boston Steemit Meetup Tuesday August 1st in Brookline, Massachusetts.  The facility is called Knight Moves and it&#x2019;s a board game cafe with games, food, and coffee/tea.  I&#x2019;ll try to be there starting at 6pmish.  The event will formally run from 6:30-8:00 and will feature a flash fiction contest and a flash science contest.  Winner&#x2019;s will receive some combination of upvotes, resteems, and SBDs from at least the two of us as well as liquid rewards from this post!</p>
<p>The primary agenda is simply to bring the community together so that we get out of our homes and go from armchair activists, business people, and cryptohounds to meeting in person.  You&#x2019;re welcome to introduce yourself as either your Steemit Handle or birth name.  We request pictures be limited to only people that consent.  We&#x2019;re not here to Doxx!  We&#x2019;re here to meet and build this community.</p>
<p>Space is initially limited to 35 people.  So, please send any amount of steem/sbd to me with the memo &#x201C;Boston Meetup.&#x201D;  If you&#x2019;d like to sponsor food or something, but can&#x2019;t come please note that in the memo.  If this post brings in well over that amount of people then we&#x2019;ll likely change venues, but keep the date and time.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m going to sell advertising in a small pamphlet too to benefit the Minnow Support Project.  If you&#x2019;d like to purchase a print ad for the event please send 20 SBD for a 1/2 page ad or 35 SBD for a full page ad.  If you&#x2019;d also like to see it on a blogpost going out to at least 5000 people please send 80 SBD.  All ad purchases should go to @aggroed and all should have have the memo &#x201C;Boston Ad.&#x201D;  Personal and business ads are welcome.  Please keep them clean and safe for a public audience.  (There are usually 100 transactions a day going through @minnowsupport, which is why it&#x2019;s cleaner to send to @aggroed than @minnowsupport but all donations will go there).  To send the ad please contact me in the PALnet Discord Channel!</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ll also be offering a 500Sp delegation for a month as a prize to a minnow that promises to abide by MSP guidelines (no porn, no stolen content, no insults, no violence, no shitposts).</p>

<p>This is cryptopunk.  It&#x2019;s like steampunk or dieselpunk.  It depicts a different kind of life.  This one is scifi based.  You have the freedom loving people of Nagan VII and the bureaucratic Kartouri who seek to rule them.  </p>
<p>Up until now Tanic, the ships captain of the Karouri Peace Enforcers, has attacked the people of Nagan VII at least twice, he was hit with an illegal quantum slider and sent to a different dimension and had to work his way back over the course of more than a year.  He went back with more ships seeking vengence against Nagan VII and particularly Admiral Santana, but got all blowed up.  Tanic is about to stop a Kartouri from getting married to a resident of Nagan VII.</p>
<hr>
<p>Tanic was glad when the call ended.  Margaret continued to be a little intense at times.  She was excited that the ship was nearing completion and would be coming home, she&#x2019;s stated more than once that she&#x2019;s going to be ok with Baby Tanic, but Vanessa was the sticking point.  There weren&#x2019;t laws built around time and dimensional travel, so it wasn&#x2019;t clear what he should do.  The quantum slider he had been hit with was still pretty new, so he was gone in a life threatening other dimension for 2 years on the other hand Margaret just came back from buying bread for toast.  Without the law to go by there wasn&#x2019;t anything he could think of to know how to handle it properly.  They were all supposed to have brunch in a few weeks.</p>
<p>He wanted to lie back and just relax in the tube for the last minute or two before he got to the chapel, but Vanessa called.  </p>
<p>&#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D;  she wasn&#x2019;t having it&#x2026;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to the Chapel and I&#x2019;m gonna stop a marriage!&#x201D;  Tanic was clear in his mission.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Tan, you can&#x2019;t stop love.  Please don&#x2019;t do this.  It won&#x2019;t end the way you think and there will be unintended consequences!&#x201D;  Vanessa heard crying in the background.  &#x201C;I have to go.  Tanic Jr. needs me, but don&#x2019;t do this.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She hung up too.</p>
<p>The undertube stopped at Chapel Square.  Tanic stood up straightened his shirt, and got off the train.  He walked through the throng of people, up the stairs, and onto the Streets of Nagnarock.  It was a clear sunny day if not a little red tinged lighting from the second son.  He checked his Tech Tube for directions, and walked about a block and half through the busy street past the shops displaying everything you might expect in a city.</p>
<p>The chapel wasn&#x2019;t much to look at compared to the rest of the city.  It looked like an old building out of place and worn with time.  It had a large clearing around it and the developers around here had been kind to leave it some space in the city rather than taking every inch from it.  It could host a few hundred people, which might make this a little awkward, but it needed to happen.</p>
<p>The inside of the chapel&#x2019;s dull wood was nothing compared to the bright red&#x2019;s of the bride&#x2019;s side.  The bride, the bride&#x2019;s maids, and the most of the bride&#x2019;s friends and family were wearing Nagan Red outfits.  The bride was clad in crimson from head to to toe.  She was gorgeous even from the back of the chapel.  Across from her was Cloh who up until a second ago was grinning like an idiot gazing at his bride.  The room turned to look at Tanic as he loudly opened the Chapel doors.</p>
<p>Tanic didn&#x2019;t waste any time &#x201C;Ok people, this wedding is over.  By writ of Chairman Mago no weddings are to take place between Kartouri and the people of Nagan VII.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Cloh got down from the podium he was standing on with his bride, and headed to the Captain Tanic.  Several bridesmaids followed as well.  &#x201C;Tanic, I resigned.  I&#x2019;m not an officer.  You have no say here.  I&#x2019;ve found freedom, and I&#x2019;ve found my wife.  I&#x2019;m not going back!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic was firm &#x201C;Clearly these people are messing with your head Cloh.  You&#x2019;ve been here a month.  That&#x2019;s hardly time to figure out a new planet let alone marry anyone.  All of you are out of your minds.  This has to stop immediately.  Cloh!  You&#x2019;re coming with me this instant.  I can&#x2019;t hide this on your record.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Cloh &#x201C;Not happening captain.  I&#x2019;m done.  I don&#x2019;t want anything to do with the Kartouri.  You&#x2019;re free to sit and watch as my friend, but this is happening.&#x201D;  He put crossed his arms in an &#x201C;I dare you fuck with me&#x201D; stance.</p>
<p>Tanic took a step forward, and heard about 15 men draw a weapon on the Bride&#x2019;s side.  How are these fuckers armed all the time!?!  Tanic was thinking about what do to when one of the smaller bridesmaid&#x2019;s approached.  Tanic ignored her. &#x201C;Put your guns down, Cloh you&#x2019;re coming with me.&#x201D;  He grabbed him by the arm, but Cloh pushed back.  After just a moment of struggle Tanic tore the suit that Cloh was wearing, and now his shoulder was exposed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s it!&#x201D;  The small bride&#x2019;s maid swiftly approached them while they exchanged stunned glances over the jacket ripping and took the opportunity to promptly knee Captain Tanic in the balls.  &#x201C;That&#x2019;s for Cloh!&#x201D;  As he doubled over in pain she kicked him in the head-  &#x201C;That&#x2019;s for Kaylin!!!&#x201D;  As he curled up in the fetal position she stomped him one last time &#x201C;and that&#x2019;s for Nagan VII!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic felt strong arms dragging him forcefully out of the chapel.  While the bride&#x2019;s maid was saying &#x201C;I know, do no harm&#x2026; but it&#x2019;s also take no shit!&#x201D; He was clinging to his balls which may have just ruptured.  He had the thought that if Nagan VII could change Cloh it could change anyone.  He had to get off this rock, but first&#x2026; time to get some ice and a medic!</p>

<p>Chapter 2- Episode 2.</p>
<p>&#x201C;One week!  One fuckin&#x2019; week.  Do you have any idea how much trouble these idiots have caused in one week?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sammo, Muxxy, Swelk and Mystique were holding back smiles.  They knew this shit would happen when Santana told them she was going to bring the Kartouri down to the planet.  Bring a bunch of Kart statist idiots to &#x2018;Nage&#x2019; and you&#x2019;re gonna have trouble.</p>
<p>&#x201C;For fuck&#x2019;s sake.  Seriously, 1500 people are causing so much trouble.  We&#x2019;re fuckin&#x2019; helping them.  They came here.  They attacked us.  We didn&#x2019;t even fire, and these dickheads don&#x2019;t know how to act.  You know what one of them said to me?  &#x2018;There wasn&#x2019;t a law against killing the cow on the property so what&#x2019;s the big deal.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Muxxy and Swelk started laughing.  Even Santana crossed a smile.</p>
<p>Rho was a prominent writer and a good friend and walked over to Santana and put a hand on her shoulder.  &#x201C;It&#x2019;s gonna be ok, she said calmly, they&#x2019;ll learn, and when they do go home, they&#x2019;ll take it back with them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Santana&#x2019;s rage subsided a bit.  Yes it was frustrating to deal with all these new people on her planet.  When she&#x2019;s not explaining to another Kart newb how to use a tech tab she&#x2019;s getting constant requests for the simplist tasks.  How do you upload a picture?  I didn&#x2019;t save the planet four times just to sit around and teach you to click the camera icon&#x2026; Oh well, maybe Rho was right.  They&#x2019;ll learn.  She took a deep breath, and then Tanic and the delegation from Kartouri arrived.</p>
<p>The room got awkward quickly.  Tanic and his crew had been there to kill them all a few days back.  Things like that are hard to forget.  Tanic&#x2019;s kid lost an eye and now had a freaky little baby cyborg eye in there instead.  That served as a daily reminder why he should come back a year from now and kill everyone.</p>
<p>Tanic started &#x201C;Admiral Santana, crew, thank you for meeting with us.  The situation on this planet is quite desparate.  Since our capture there has been zero central contact, there&#x2019;s been zero central efforts, I haven&#x2019;t even heard from any specific leader.  Surely, we can negotiate an immediate return of our property.&#x201D;  </p>
<p>&#x201C;Tanic&#x201D; Santana started, &#x201C;It doens&#x2019;t work that way here.  I know it sounds pretty unfamiliar but we don&#x2019;t have a central authority.  The people in this room are your best bet, but we&#x2019;re just people.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic was frustrated.  &#x201C;Surely there is someone we can talk to.  I heard of a Mayor Aggie.  What about him?  There are people called Witnesses.  You have to be able to setup a meeting with them.  The conditions are horrible here.  Where are all the services?  Where do your taxes go to?  I don&#x2019;t even understand how your people have roads!!!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Santana was receiving all this frustrating energy.  She was about to rip&#x2019;em one, but Sammo chimed in instead.  &#x201C;Look mate, it don&#x2019;t work like that &#x2018;ere.  Ain&#x2019;t no taxes, &#x2018;aven&#x2019;t had&#x2019;em in my life.  We each do our own thing and ain&#x2019;t nobody takes what&#x2019;s mine without me agreeing.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic was yelling &#x201C;This place is out of control!!! We&#x2019;ve had over 18 Kartouri, many of them officers, shot with your stun rifles.  Who do we take that to?  Where is our recourse?  How do we get justice for that?  You can&#x2019;t simply shoot an officer of the Kartouri!!!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Santana couldn&#x2019;t let it go &#x201C;Well, what stupid shit were you officers doing huh Tanic?  Were they wandering around with a fucking knife trying to &#x201C;talk&#x201D; to kids?  I&#x2019;d shoot them too.  Nagan doesn&#x2019;t have any laws, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean we don&#x2019;t have principles.  Do no harm but take no shit is about the only rule around here that everyone agrees to.  My guess is that if I dig into each one of those, which I&#x2019;m doing, I&#x2019;m going to find some arrogant piece of shit Kartouri doing something stupid!  How could you come to our planet to kill us when you know so little about us?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic was flustered!  &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not going to hear any more of this.  If you respected our laws it wouldn&#x2019;t be an issue.  You&#x2019;re the terrorist that shot sliders.  How dare you lecture me?  I&#x2019;ll be writing a post about this Santana, and I&#x2019;ll be sure to tag many of your so called Megaloth friends in it.  We&#x2019;ll see what they have to say about it!  In the meantime please make sure you arrange for more food for us.  You&#x2019;d cause much harm if you let us all starve.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic turned in a hurumph to leave, but Santana&#x2019;s wall tech flashed up.  Incoming message stream from Beardo, Subject Tanic&#x2019;s baby :)   Santana said &#x201C;open&#x201D; and the stream opened.  Tanic stopped to hear the news.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hey Santana, I have to run in a second, but I&#x2019;m at the hospital and I just met with Vanessa and baby Tanic.  I can&#x2019;t do anything about them being Kartouri, but the good news is that the burns are healed and mom&#x2019;s back to normal, and the last round of the eye is finished.  Looks a little cyborgian blue, but it was nicely done, most people won&#x2019;t ever know.  I gotta get back to it, love to Rho, peace.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tanic&#x2019;s frustration melted after hearing his girlfriend and baby were ok.  Margaret probably won&#x2019;t be too happy about it, but he was.  He took a deep breath.  &#x201C;Can we see them now?&#x201D;  Santana&#x2019;s anger melted, she smiled warmly and said &#x201C;Yeah, let&#x2019;s do that.  I&#x2019;ll grab my coat.&#x201D;  </p>
<hr>
<p>As they were taking the deep tubes in silence across from one another she realized that for the first time in the week he&#x2019;d been on Nag that Tanic had said please and asked a question instead of making a demand.  Maybe he can change, and if he can maybe the other Karts can too.  &#x201C;Hey, I&#x2019;m sorry I yelled.&#x201D;  Santana told him.  He just nodded.  &#x201C;Me too.&#x201D;  He said quietly.</p>

<p>Adapted from Shell Silverstein,&#x201D;Hug O&#x2019; War&#x201D; from Where the Sidewalk Ends: the poems &amp; drawings of Shel Silverstein, published by Harper &amp; Row Junior Books, 10 East 53rd Street, New York, N.Y. 10022. Copyright &#xA9; 1974 by Evil Eye Music, Inc. </p>
<p>Shel liked poetry, kids, funny art, and dirty jokes.  He also wrote &#x201C;Boy Named Sue&#x201D; which Jonny Cash made famous.  I think he would have been a fuckin&#x2019; superstar on Steemit.</p>

<p>Anyway,  here&#x2019;s my adaptation.  The MSP community was talking about flagging a comment that we didn&#x2019;t like because it was snide to a member trying to do good things.  Rather than flaggin&#x2019; the rude comment we altered course to upvote more positive comments and knock it down some.  It&#x2019;s a good lesson and I&#x2019;m glad it went as such.</p>
