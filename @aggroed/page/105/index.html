<p>Hey,  my name is Aggroed.  I&#x2019;ve been in the crypto space for about a year and a half.  I mostly work with the Steem blockchain.  I&#x2019;m a Witness for Steem, which is like being a successful miner for other coins.  I&#x2019;m also a witness for Peerplays and am working on setting up a witness for BTS and EOS (when it&#x2019;s ready).  What can I say, I like Dan coins! </p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve been working with new members to the Steem blockchain in an extensive and time intensive role for the past four months.  I lead a group called the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network, which houses the Minnow Support Project, which is the Steemit official new member welcoming group.  We have over 6,000 active Steemians who communicate in there and they ask a ton of questions!  </p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve been answering crypto questions for a while, been studying blockchains intensively, and feel like I have a fairly solid handle on how things work.  I also have a PhD in chemistry so some of the complicated formulas and processes aren&#x2019;t entirely lost on me (some still are, but I get the gist).</p>
<p>All that is to say that I have some sense of what&#x2019;s driving value.  I&#x2019;ve been trying to get my dad to invest in crypto and he&#x2019;s wondering what gives it value.  So, here I am to explain for a couple paragraphs what is a currency, what is a stock, and what is a crypto.  Then I&#x2019;ll try to talk a little about why single crypto tokens are worth more than single printed dollars.  I&#x2019;m not a financial advisor, but I do like cryptos as a financial investment.  Just make sure you do your own research and take ownership of your financial future.</p>
<h2 id="A-quick-video"><a href="#A-quick-video" class="headerlink" title="A quick video "></a>A quick video </h2><h2></h2><p>Here&#x2019;s a nice video that talks about what gives a standard government issued currency value.  It&#x2019;s TED-ED so, it&#x2019;s a pretty mainstream explanation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNu5ppFZbHo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNu5ppFZbHo</a></p>
<p>The basics is that:</p>
<p>Value of the currency &#x2248; total amount of goods and services</p>
<p>I like to approximate it like this</p>
<p>The value of the currency &#x2248; total number of people using the system</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s because I believe that the the total number of people using a system is a good approximation for the total amount of good and services in that system.  This isn&#x2019;t entirely true as some groups of people are more productive than others, but I think it&#x2019;s ok when we&#x2019;re looking at global phenomena like government currencies and crypto currencies.</p>
<p>My key point here is that PEOPLE ACCEPTING IT AS VALUE IS WHAT GIVES IT VALUE!  How much value we can talk about below, but the real thing to understand when stated as simply as possible is: <strong>People are the value!</strong></p>
<h2 id="Why-do-people-even-use-currency"><a href="#Why-do-people-even-use-currency" class="headerlink" title="Why do people even use currency? "></a>Why do people even use currency? </h2><h2></h2><p>Because it&#x2019;s so much easier than barter!  Look I&#x2019;m a chemist by trade.  If I have to trade hours of chemistry labor for a certain amount of vegan meatballs it&#x2019;s going to be pretty challenging.  I need to find a vegan meatball sales man willing to accept hours of chemistry labor to make the trade happen&#x2026; Instead we all collectively decide it&#x2019;s better to have currencies we can all use and then trade for the currency as a medium of exchange.  This makes life a lot easier!</p>
<h2 id="Who-gets-to-create-currencies"><a href="#Who-gets-to-create-currencies" class="headerlink" title="Who gets to create currencies? "></a>Who gets to create currencies? </h2><h2></h2><p>For 100 years or so the only people creating currencies that are adopted on a wide scale are governments (or the private banks they employ).  They print money.  They get to print the money because they are in charge.  You&#x2019;re born under their rule and they print it as they see fit.  Sometimes they do good things with it and you experience a nice life.  Sometimes they enact horrible plans and you&#x2019;re stuck rioting as your national economy goes through a hyperinflated death spiral.  Either way you&#x2019;re not really choosing your currency when you&#x2019;re born.  You simply have the local currency and that&#x2019;s your option.</p>
<p>But an interesting thing happened with bitcoin, then it&#x2019;s clones, and then it&#x2019;s alts.  Government currencies suddenly had a new competitor.  They used to have some of that competition back in the Wild Cat Banking era, when private banks issued currencies all the time.  This was actually a pretty good time for people.  There were booms and busts in those currencies, but it was generally prosperous because people could invest as they saw fit in good private currencies and some fortunes were made.  But the USG consolidated that back in the early 1900s.  So, private currencies isn&#x2019;t a new thing.  It&#x2019;s just that now there&#x2019;s new technology that allows it and makes it fairly simple to implement globally.</p>
<h2 id="Blockchains-and-Crytpo-Currencies"><a href="#Blockchains-and-Crytpo-Currencies" class="headerlink" title="Blockchains and Crytpo Currencies "></a>Blockchains and Crytpo Currencies </h2><h2></h2><p>What&#x2019;s a blockchain? What&#x2019;s crypto?  A blockchain is a big ledger.  A ledger is basically a data table that keeps track of individual accounts, what&#x2019;s been issued, and who owns what.  The blockchain starts pretty simply and over time it adds transactions and new people.  The whole block chain is made up of individual blocks.  Each block keeps information that was stored in it during that time period.  <code>Sally sent Jim 15 tokens.</code>  <code>Jim sent Jane 10 Tokens.</code>  <code>The platform generated 1 new token</code> would be some of the transactions stored in an individual block.  Every X minutes a blockchain will store what happened on the chain in that time period in a new block and add that block to the chain.  Each block chain determines how much time is stored in each block.</p>
<p>It would be like saving just the changes to an excel table rather than the whole table every 5 minutes, and storing all those series of changes in lots of little linked files.</p>
<p>The crypto part comes from the fact that people could try to corrupt these data tables to show something like <code>everyone transfers aggroed 10% of their money.</code>&#x2018;  If you&#x2019;re aggroed that&#x2019;s awesome, but if you&#x2019;re everyone that&#x2019;s bad.  So, to make that a challenging or practically an impossible task blockchain technologies also incorporate cryptographic techniques through &#x201C;hashing&#x201D; that make it extremely difficult bordering on impossible to crack the &#x201C;crypto safe.&#x201D;</p>
<h2 id="Let&#x2019;s-talk-about-stocks-for-a-second"><a href="#Let&#x2019;s-talk-about-stocks-for-a-second" class="headerlink" title="Let&#x2019;s talk about stocks for a second "></a>Let&#x2019;s talk about stocks for a second </h2><h2></h2><p>Another investment type is a stock.  Why would you invest in a stock?  The simple answer is that you believe the stock can make more money than you can with the money that you have.  You inherently believe that a group of a people working on solving a problem or set of problems by offering a product or service to the market can do a better job earning money than you.  This is likely true.  </p>
<p>You alone aren&#x2019;t a team of people backed by capital working on a project so it&#x2019;s more likely that a company could take your money and invest it into their projects and earn you more money back than you could just by yourself.  There are obvious exceptions to this, but if you&#x2019;re not the business type, but happen to have some extra cash companies can put your money to work and so you&#x2019;re happy to buy shares in them.  One of the main things determining the value of one stock compared to others is how much money can you expect to earn from owning one share of the company either through price increases or dividends.</p>
<p>Ultimately though you like stocks because they are a store of value, you think they will make more money than simply hoarding cash, and you think that the stock will likely go up in value as people work in the company.</p>
<h2 id="Cryptos-are-a-combination-of-a-stock-and-a-currency"><a href="#Cryptos-are-a-combination-of-a-stock-and-a-currency" class="headerlink" title="Cryptos are a combination of a stock and a currency "></a>Cryptos are a combination of a stock and a currency </h2><h2></h2><p>Most of the time you don&#x2019;t trade 15 shares of IBM for your kitchen remodel.  There&#x2019;s not really anything stopping you from doing that, but it&#x2019;s really not convenient.  That&#x2019;s because stocks aren&#x2019;t much of a currency.  Yes they have value, yes they are transferable, but there&#x2019;s really no way to quickly or easily get them from one person to another.</p>
<p>A crypto currency has a neat role of being both a stock and a currency.  It&#x2019;s a stock because essentially you own a portion of the blockchain in proportion to the number of shares you have vs everyone else.  If you own 10% of the crypto tokens on a block you essentially own 10% of the blockchain.  Unlike stocks though if I want to transfer that ownership to you I can do it quite easily.  I click a button or type in a command and suddenly <code>@aggroed transfers 100 steem to @minnowsupport.</code>  That was easy.  It took 3 seconds and I didn&#x2019;t even have to leave my computer, call a broker, or god forbid write a check and schlep my way to the front entry way of my house to mail out the check.</p>
<h2 id="Cryptos-vs-Government-Currencies-and-deflation-vs-inflation"><a href="#Cryptos-vs-Government-Currencies-and-deflation-vs-inflation" class="headerlink" title="Cryptos vs Government Currencies and deflation vs inflation"></a>Cryptos vs Government Currencies and deflation vs inflation</h2><h2></h2><p>Before 1971 every government dollar was backed by a store of gold.  You could walk into any bank and say &#x201C;Hey, um, I don&#x2019;t like this dollar bill, and I&#x2019;d like to exchange it for gold.&#x201D;  They&#x2019;d give you gold.  You do that now and they give you funny looks.  That&#x2019;s because the USG took the USD off the gold standard in the 1970s.  Without the gold standard to keep printing in check the government decided to print and print and print money.  The USG/FED now prints 160M USD a day.  It&#x2019;s a lot of money, and it leads to a lot of inflation.  Essentially the money in your wallet will be purchase fewer goods and service tomorrow than it will today!</p>
<p>Crypto currencies have a range of answers to this, but generally speaking they have a cap on the number of tokens that can be printed and the currency generation is slow.  This makes crypto currencies deflationary relative to government fiat dollars.  That means that the amount of money in your crypto wallet today will buy more goods and services tomorrow than it will today.  This helps give crypto currencies value because if you have the choice of holding your money in a spot guaranteed to lose value or likely to increase in value it&#x2019;s an easy decision.</p>
<h2 id="Other-differences-between-Government-Dollars-fiat-and-Cryptos"><a href="#Other-differences-between-Government-Dollars-fiat-and-Cryptos" class="headerlink" title="Other differences between Government Dollars (fiat) and Cryptos) "></a>Other differences between Government Dollars (fiat) and Cryptos) </h2><h2></h2><p>There are some key differences between these systems too.</p>
<p>Government Fiat Dollars are generally tracked and your ID logged everywhere.  Crypto is psuedoanymous.  If I want to buy weed with a credit card it will register everywhere.  I might get arrested.  If I buy weed with crypto then people might see that @aggroed made the transaction but it woudln&#x2019;t necessarily link to me in a government registry.  Some people like crypto because of this layer of protection FROM government.</p>
<p>This is important if your government makes any retroactive laws.  What you did that was legal at one point now gets you arrested.  You made a political donation to the opposition!  Poof!  Jail for you&#x2026; It would have been safer if it was anonymous or psuedo anonymous.</p>
<p>Taxes:  Don&#x2019;t just take it from me:</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmbChKNPZJWbYAakiJkMrsnjwuGYu92VRH5k2mhgSDrjzZ/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>See, on every single purchase I make with fiat dollars I get taxed.  Salary is taxed, buying and selling is taxed, my taxes are taxed.  I don&#x2019;t remember consenting to 40% of my income being taxed away so I tend to think it&#x2019;s pretty coercive.  Luckily cryptos don&#x2019;t have this problem.  Yeah, I&#x2019;ll likely pay some capital gains taxes on this stuff, but in the grand scheme of things that&#x2019;s cheap compared to the absurd amount of taxes that I&#x2019;d otherwise have to throw at normal government dollars.  </p>
<p>That&#x2019;s also assuming I&#x2019;m going to pay taxes.  If I&#x2019;m successfully able to dump crypto for hard cash then I might avoid all taxes forever.  That&#x2019;s good for my bankroll and good for the third world people the USG would be likely to bomb with the money I fork over under duress.  It could be bad for me though if I&#x2019;m caught.  Some people do go to jail for this as it is generally considered money laundering by the people that want a cut of all your transactions.</p>
<p>Speed- I&#x2019;m used to Steem and SBD where transactions are processed in 3 seconds.  I tear my eyes out waiting the 30 min to several hours waiting for bitcoin and litecoin transactions, I laugh disgustedly at how long it takes to process USD through a bank.   IT TAKES DAYS!  You know how long that is in internet time?  That&#x2019;s like a month of internet life.  Ain&#x2019;t nobody got time for that!</p>
<p>Consensus- On the blockchain you get to decide how the blockchain will work.  You typically have a say directly proportional to how much of the blockchain tokens you own.  Want to change parameters then you and your like minded folks can get changes passed.  It&#x2019;s a lot harder to do this with governments especially when they are corrupt and bribed extensively. </p>
<p>Choice- I guess ultimately one of my favorite aspects is my ability to choose the system I like the best.  The block chains are different in terms of number of tokens, who runs them, current price, level of anonymity, reputation of the coin, and a million other things.  I like being able to choose which ones I want to own and which communities I want to support or engage with financially.</p>
<h2 id="The-long-term"><a href="#The-long-term" class="headerlink" title="The long term "></a>The long term </h2><h2></h2><p>One day I&#x2019;m going to walk into Edward Jones and my financial adviser is going to talk to me about a range of investment options including stocks, bonds, annuities, mutual funds, cryptos, commodities, and properties.  We&#x2019;re not quite there yet, but this is the wave of the future.  Cryptos do this kind of stuff better and with more transparency than anything that&#x2019;s come before it.</p>
<p>The dot com bubble was $7T in scope and almost entirely a US event.  Crypto is global and only sitting at 500B or so.  I think we&#x2019;re at the very beginning of this.  In fact I think at least 14x more money is going to pour into this place, and that these prices are going to have more 0s in them before long.</p>
<p>For now my friends and family ask me if I&#x2019;m able to convert between government fiat dollars and crypto.  Right this second it&#x2019;s an issue, but doable.  I think in the longer term everyone will accept crypto.  It makes commerce easier and as more people have them more people will demand merchants accepts them.</p>

<h2 id="Volatility"><a href="#Volatility" class="headerlink" title="Volatility "></a>Volatility </h2><h2></h2><p>One thing that&#x2019;s worth considering is that cryptos are incredible volatile.  They go up and down in price by pretty wild swings.  There&#x2019;s money to be made from that, but especially if you&#x2019;re in need of weekly income from an investment then crypto has significant drawbacks if you can&#x2019;t out wait some of the swings.</p>
<h2 id="More-to-come"><a href="#More-to-come" class="headerlink" title="More to come "></a>More to come </h2><h2></h2><p>Anyway, I&#x2019;m still just starting to build the case for why crypto.  So, I&#x2019;ll add some more points to this over the coming weeks in new installments.</p>

        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmbSrYjSwMGMJE31NThQReD6sATRtbeZMKLBrbkSn66EAX/You&apos;ve%20got%20flag.png" alt="You&apos;ve got flag.png"></p>
<p>Believe it or not the system is actually sorta working in the case of @haejin.  What the fuck is a @haejin?  Well, check out his blog.  He does technical analysis of cryptos to determine which are good buys.  It involves a quantum mentality that patterns exist in the stock ticker that can be used to understand universal trends of stocks and then pick good ones based on knowledge of those repeating patterns.  He&#x2019;s been doing this for 15 years and brings a measure of expertise to the system.  </p>
<p>Does it work?  Fuck if I know, but I believe that he is able to recognize patterns and it does seem some of those patterns are repetitive, but I&#x2019;m not sure the extent to which it works.  He&#x2019;s made some good calls, but also didn&#x2019;t call the massive correction.  He had two posts in trending at the same time.  One was calling for 23k BTC and the other saying corrections are healthy as we took a dive.</p>
<p>Some of his picks have seen substantial growth, but we&#x2019;re in a bull market.  Some of his stuff seems pretty cool, but there are other explanations.  It&#x2019;s enough that I&#x2019;ve purchased a few picks on his recommendations, but I&#x2019;m not betting a house on it.  I&#x2019;ve spoken to him once, and he seems like a normal dude.  I was wondering if he wanted to come on the Minnow Mayor Town Hall with me before all this stuff blew up.</p>
<h2 id="Rancho"><a href="#Rancho" class="headerlink" title="Rancho "></a>Rancho </h2><h2></h2><p>I found @haejin because another whale told me about him.  He was getting 4000 views on his $20 rewards posts.  It seems a lot of traders are coming here to figure out what @haejin is telling them to do.  </p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t know how Rancho found @haejin, but Rancho is one of the largest accounts on here and a very early investor in Steem, but he&#x2019;s been passive af.  The guy barely ever votes and almost never notices what&#x2019;s going on here it would seem, but some how he found haejin and started hitting his posts, of which there are several a day, with massive $260+ upvotes.  I don&#x2019;t know what he liked because he never commented or anything, but maybe he made some money on a @haejin tip?  Maybe he liked the views to rewards ratio?  IDk, but he started dropping lovebombs on @haejin.</p>
<p>As a result of the extra love on his posts basically everything that haejin wrote went into trending right away.  He picked up thousands of followers and a few prominent members of the community displeased by his share of the rewards pool</p>
<h2 id="Flagging"><a href="#Flagging" class="headerlink" title="Flagging "></a>Flagging </h2><h2></h2><p>As much I believe that Rancho has every single right to upvote posts to whatever level he wants I also believe this community has the power and authority to use their votes to nullify those rewards.  If the community thinks that the technical analysis posts aren&#x2019;t worth it they have every right to flag.  This is actually how we as a community can turn trending page, which basically just states who has the most votes, into a trending page to where there&#x2019;s some level of consensus on what a good article is.  </p>
<p>Don&#x2019;t like the circle jerk post on a recipe and don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s worth it?  Flag it.  </p>
<p>Right now there&#x2019;s a lot of stigma against flags, but as long as we&#x2019;re in linear rewards <strong>if we&#x2019;re not flagging then we&#x2019;re not actually helping to discover content.</strong>  That&#x2019;s bad for us as a platform.  We used to be able to avoid some of this with exponential rewards, but those days are gone.  Right now we&#x2019;re often just discovering who can trade or buy votes the best.  What we really need to do is figure out how to get good content on our front page so that people come here to find good content!</p>
<h2 id="Violence"><a href="#Violence" class="headerlink" title="Violence "></a>Violence </h2><h2></h2><p>Now, I&#x2019;ve stated before and stand by my argument that flagging is a type of violence.  It&#x2019;s financial violence.  You&#x2019;re removing value that other people put there.  I get the argument that it&#x2019;s not yours until pay day, but that&#x2019;s more of an experienced trader perspective than a typical author on the block.  They think it&#x2019;s theirs, and when you take it away through a flag it feels like you have stolen from them, and I tend to see merit in both sides.</p>
<p>But the part that may not always be clear coming from the leader of a peace group is that sometimes violence is ok.  This is do no harm, but take no shit land.  If you think that the reward pool is being raped or taken advantage of then by all means flag.  If they are causing you and this community harm by taking advantage of the system then give them a digital boot up the ass.  If you don&#x2019;t we all suffer from their theft!</p>
<p>If you think the rewards are way out of line then flag.  We&#x2019;re not going to have real content, people, or project discovery if we never flag.</p>
<h2 id="Gotta-be-careful-flagging"><a href="#Gotta-be-careful-flagging" class="headerlink" title="Gotta be careful flagging "></a>Gotta be careful flagging </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;ve been in short lived flag wars and they suck and this community can behave in ways you don&#x2019;t expect.  So, flagging because of rewards disagreement is actually an ok thing to do.  Sometimes it&#x2019;s necessary for people abusing the pool.  Sometimes it&#x2019;s necessary to bring rewards down to sensible levels.  Sometimes you do it to break up a circle jerk.  It can be scary af because you&#x2019;re stepping into trouble when you flag right now because it&#x2019;s a heated thing to do these days.</p>
<p>Also, it&#x2019;s clouded because at other times people are just being a dick, opinion flagging, or going on offense&#x2026; at that point the community may not respect your choices.  You may simply be drawing attention to the exact person you&#x2019;re trying to smush and that doesn&#x2019;t always work out well.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re a minnow you have to be careful flagging people because you don&#x2019;t have a lot of steem power.  Other accounts can nuke your rep, nuke your rewards, and basically revenge flag you to pieces.  It&#x2019;s tricky business just like a fist fight may get your face bloodied you might just get your financial ass handed to you for the previous week&#x2019;s rewards.</p>
<h2 id="My-point-however-is-that-the-system-is-mostly-sorta-working"><a href="#My-point-however-is-that-the-system-is-mostly-sorta-working" class="headerlink" title="My point however is that the system is mostly sorta working "></a>My point however is that the system is mostly sorta working </h2><h2></h2><p>Rancho used his power to vote.<br>This community used it&#x2019;s power to down vote.</p>
<p>This is actually healthy.  This isn&#x2019;t making Steem a horrible place.  This is actually a good thing for this platform to have some level of balance.</p>
<h2 id="3-Unhealthy-Parts"><a href="#3-Unhealthy-Parts" class="headerlink" title="3 Unhealthy Parts "></a>3 Unhealthy Parts </h2><h2></h2><ol>
<li><p>I don&#x2019;t think @haejin&#x2019;s posts are worth 260 each.  I don&#x2019;t think they are worth 0 each.  I also don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s a scammer or trying to rape the pool.  I don&#x2019;t currently believe he has some agreement or anything like that with Rancho.  He&#x2019;s not an evil guy cause he caught some rewards.  I respect the flaggers saying he&#x2019;s rewarded too high.  I&#x2019;d ask you don&#x2019;t take him down to 0, but let him continue to earn something on the posts.  I&#x2019;m sure you can find a healthy line, but I think 0 is taking it too far.  Let the guy earn at least the 20 he was making before this shit started.  He is bringing a lot of views to the platform.</p>
</li>
<li><p>@haejin you&#x2019;re following a handful of recent bad examples of how to deal with flagging poorly.  You&#x2019;re currently in the spotlight like no other person on the platform.  This isn&#x2019;t a time for a ragequit letter.  You should be thankful to get this attention and work to mitigate some of the fall out.  Shouting &#x201C;well, I&#x2019;m gonna take my ball and go home, and you guys are dicks&#x201D; which is the rough equivalent of what you wrote isn&#x2019;t a good response.  I&#x2019;d suggest you take a second to ponder a better less angry response and realize that the rest of this community has a point too.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Name calling. It would be nice if all the people could express frustration with actions and less with people.  I know tempers get high, but I would continue to express that what we&#x2019;re seeing is multiple people trying to do what they think is best for them and this platform.  This can be a healthy discussion, but not when it focuses on attacking other people.  That makes a good resolution harder.  So, if folks could try to cool it with some language.  The upvoting whales aren&#x2019;t evil, the flagging whales aren&#x2019;t evil, the author isn&#x2019;t evil, and from what I&#x2019;ve seen the commenters aren&#x2019;t evil.  They&#x2019;re just people.  All of them.  <strong>If you could all try to be mildly civil with one another that would be swell.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Take-home"><a href="#Take-home" class="headerlink" title="Take home "></a>Take home </h2><h2></h2><p>Linear rewards needs flagging to be a functional part of the platform that isn&#x2019;t filled with the stigma of flags.  We need it for honest content and people discovery.  I also don&#x2019;t think it should cost the flagger money (they don&#x2019;t receive curation rewards for flagging, so it costs money relative to just upvoting a different post).  Flagging can be an incredibly valuable service to this community because it returns all those flagged rewards back to the community for the rest of us to share.<br> Flags can be healthy, flags can be useful, people upvoting and flagging are ok humans.</p>
<p>Whales have rights to upvote AND flag, and that can be a  healthy part of this place.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re getting flagged take a deep breath, realize it might be the biggest thing that could happen to your account, and try not to write up rage quit letters that put you in a negative light.  Be gracious, see the story from the other perspective, and try to work with folks rather than against them.</p>
<p>This place is pretty amazing.  Please treat it and one another with respect even when you disagree and especially when you&#x2019;re mad.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m often the melancholy sort.  I try to have a lot of energy and pour it into projects, but there&#x2019;s always a hint of sadness.  One of he main reasons why is the passing of my mom.  She died at the age of 59.  She was a pretty extraordinary woman.  She was fierce as could be, loved deeply, and tried to make the world a better place through her actions.  Hardly a day and certainly not a  week goes by without me missing her some way.  It makes Christmas extra hard.</p>

"></a>Am I the only one that doesn&#x2019;t love Christmas? </h2><h2></h2><p>I just wish this thing was called what it is: an end of year sale.  I don&#x2019;t like how we&#x2019;re wrapping up a spirit of kindness and giving with buying stupid shit you don&#x2019;t need with money you can&#x2019;t really spare.  I can&#x2019;t sing but I was caroling.  I don&#x2019;t mind some aspects of this time of year&#x2026; but I&#x2019;ll tell you a quick story.</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t like the excessive gift giving, but that&#x2019;s not really taken into account in my home at Christmas time.  After an hour of opening presents my first baby says &#x201C;Last year we had more presents.&#x201D;  Kinda broke my heart.  I try to instill an attitude of gratefulness and I think Christmas often times brings out massive selfishness.  So, we went sledding and I tried to have a Louis CK inspired discussion of gratefulness.</p>

<p>She got a little weepy, and so maybe I&#x2019;m the worst Dad ever to make her sorta cry on Christmas, but I&#x2019;m not gonna let this abject idiotic materialism ruin my kid&#x2019;s perspective on what good fortune actually means.  It&#x2019;s no fun holding the line, but I want a child with healthy perspectives and Christmas actually doesn&#x2019;t instill them.  Sorry not sorry.</p>
<hr>
<p>To top that off I can&#x2019;t help but miss my mom.  It&#x2019;s been over 10 years since she passed.  I&#x2019;m incredibly grateful for how fiercely she loved me, but it still stings because especially on the holidays I can feel that missing gap even to this day.  </p>
<p>So, I know this is a sorta Christmas Grump message, but as we approach the new year let us remember those we loved and lost, let us carry some of their best spirit with us, here&#x2019;s to those holding the line on sensibility during the Christmas season, and as we have some family time let&#x2019;s try to stay in that moment and store just a hint of it to carry with us later.</p>
<p>Much love,<br>Merry Christmas,</p>
<p>Aggroed</p>

<p>Let&#x2019;s not bury the lead.  Don&#x2019;t power up your post 100% right now!  This is insane to do and you&#x2019;re missing larger payouts because of this mistake!  Let&#x2019;s go over some economics of how Steem works!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Steem-Steem-Power-and-SBD"><a href="#Steem-Steem-Power-and-SBD" class="headerlink" title="Steem, Steem Power, and SBD "></a>Steem, Steem Power, and SBD </h2><h2></h2><p>There are three tokens on Steem.  Steem, Steem Power, and SBD.  Steem and Steem Power have a 1:1 price ration, but serve different purposes.  SBDs have a different price point and have contention around how they work and what they do.</p>
<p>Steem is a tradeable token that can be turned into Steem power.  It&#x2019;s roughly worth $3 USD right now.  It&#x2019;s a pretty awesome token.  It moves in 3 seconds.  It doesn&#x2019;t cost anything to use.  And despite there being 260M of them there are less than 100M that are liquid.  It&#x2019;s a nice coin.</p>
<p>Steem can also be &#x201C;powered up&#x201D; into Steem Power.  When you own Steem Power it&#x2019;s like owning a stock in a company that has dividends.  Unlike a classic stock like IBM where you really only have two choices with your dividends (reinvest or cash out) Steem gives you lots of options of what to do with these dividends.  The Steem Blockchain has a little under 10% inflation and that inflation goes into new steem tokens that are distributed to authors, curators, stake holders, and witnesses.  The more Steem Power that you have the more you can control where those dividends go.  By voting (and flagging) you have the power to direct how funds are distributed on the platform.</p>
<p>Steem Power also attracts people to you.  People like to follow and interact with folks that have more Steem Power than themselves.  This way they can earn a fair amount of money by catching votes through interaction and friendship.  There is more visible financial advantage to having whale friends than minnow friends.  So, having Steem Power (or even just renting it) can help you grow your following and get sustainable rewards.</p>
<p>SBDs don&#x2019;t allow you to choose where dividends or freshly minted Steem will go.  They are simply rewarded when your posts finally payout.  These have a different value than Steem.  They are currently worth a little less than $10 USD each. </p>
<h2 id="Quick-and-Dirty-Post-Reward-Math"><a href="#Quick-and-Dirty-Post-Reward-Math" class="headerlink" title="Quick and Dirty Post Reward Math "></a>Quick and Dirty Post Reward Math </h2><h2></h2><p>Here&#x2019;s a post that just paid out for me:  <a href="https://steemit.com/mspwaves/@aggroed/minnow-mayor-town-hall-tonight-1-6m-youtubers-represented-news-flash-btc-hits-20k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/mspwaves/@aggroed/minnow-mayor-town-hall-tonight-1-6m-youtubers-represented-news-flash-btc-hits-20k</a></p>
<p>In part because of bid bot use the total rewards listed on steemit.com was $280.</p>
<p>Curators got 59.<br>I got &#x201C;$221.&#x201D;  This isn&#x2019;t actually listed in USD.  It&#x2019;s a mix of USD and SBD.</p>
<p>SBD 110.7<br>Steem 34.5</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s deciding this price ratio from the average witness price feed you can find by checking out steemdb.com.</p>
<p>The value of those coins is pretty different.  If I round SBD to 10 and Steem to 3 then that post was worth $1107 from the SBD and a little over $100 for Steem.  If you 100% power up your Steem you&#x2019;re gonna end up with roughly 70 Steem, which could be a nice payout, but it&#x2019;s missing out on the $1107 in favor of something worth $100.  That&#x2019;s CRAZY.</p>
<p>So, here&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m doing roughly to figure out the math.   The total value is 4.3X what&#x2019;s shown on Steemit.  The liquid portion right now is basically 4X.  If you accept 100% powerup it&#x2019;ll pay you author rewards in Steem exactly equal to what&#x2019;s shown as the author portion, but the challenge is you&#x2019;d be missing out on nearly 4X the rewards.</p>

<p>Oh muh Gurd!  Freaking AWESOME!!! Just crossed the 9,000 follower threshold!  Now, you might think &#x201C;Hey, what the actual fcuk?  Didn&#x2019;t he just hit 8,000 and like two weeks before that hit 7,000?  Yes.  Yes I did.  It&#x2019;s been a good December.  I don&#x2019;t normally grow 2k followers in 1 month.</p>
<h2 id="Let&#x2019;s-talk-about-how-you-can-do-it-too"><a href="#Let&#x2019;s-talk-about-how-you-can-do-it-too" class="headerlink" title="Let&#x2019;s talk about how you can do it too!!! "></a>Let&#x2019;s talk about how you can do it too!!! </h2><h2></h2><ul>
<li><p>A strong social network!  This place is as much about the content of your content as it is about the content of your character.  That&#x2019;s weird for folks.  Amazing writers get nothing on their posts!  Why?  No network!  Also, people that are great networkers aren&#x2019;t necessarily great earners!  Why?  They aren&#x2019;t making enough posts or high quality posts.  You need both.  For social network I suggest the 6,200+ Steemian off chain Discord group I helped to found called the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network.  It&#x2019;s home to the minnowsupport project.  In there you can network with some absolutely incredible people and the more friends you have the more followers, upvotes, and resteems you&#x2019;ll get.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Quality writing.  Until you make it you better be as good as you can be.  Check, double check, and triple check your posts.  Make sure you&#x2019;re using a title and an image that will catch attention.  It&#x2019;s got to have a little click bait to it, but just a little.  You need images, and I actually think headers are crucial.  They break up your story into readable bits.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Consistency.  Coming in when the price is hawt and leaving when the price is cool isn&#x2019;t going to help you.  Many people really only want to invest in posters that will return value to this community.  Fair weather fans don&#x2019;t do that.  So, make sure you&#x2019;re posting when we&#x2019;re up and posting when we&#x2019;re down.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Engage with others!!!  You want people to talk, comment, post images and all kinds of things on your posts?  Then you better do it to theirs first!  Work with a couple people at a time and make sure you&#x2019;re on their radar for having them on yours!  You want them wondering &#x201C;hey, what&#x2019;s my friend @yournamehere gonna say about this&#x201D; while they are writing it.  The secret to get that is to start by doing it for others.  This place follows your actions with rewards and not the other way around.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Help other people.  Take a second and see what problems folks have around them.  See if you can solve any of those for them.  These people make great long term friendships because they count on you and rely on you.  You need some of that to be successful.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>BONUS- Create something!  We want to see this platform grow and change and be awesome!  Investors/whales want to see that you&#x2019;re doing something awesome to help the block.  The exact details of what it is doesn&#x2019;t matter that much, but help other people, make something awesome, or spread the word.  These will get you attention.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="A-contentious-suggestion"><a href="#A-contentious-suggestion" class="headerlink" title="A contentious suggestion "></a>A contentious suggestion </h2><h2></h2><p>Without a doubt running a witness has helped my growth.  Without a doubt helping other people through the minnowsupport project has helped my growth.  Without a doubt the price spike of steema and SBDs has helped.  What actually has some doubts is the effect of bid bots.  I&#x2019;ve used these little guys extensively over the past month.  I&#x2019;ve been pumping up post rewards, and when possible I&#x2019;ve even hit trending because of it.  It&#x2019;s been a fun experiment.  I gave some competition to the shit posters, I typically broke even or better on my bids (though there are about 4-5 exceptions to that), and I generally got more followers faster.  It took a lot of capital and risk, but I&#x2019;m pretty sure it&#x2019;s contributed to my growth enough that I&#x2019;m still doing it.</p>
<h2 id="4-Docs"><a href="#4-Docs" class="headerlink" title="4 Docs "></a>4 Docs </h2><h2></h2><p>There are four docs I think people should make on this platform.</p>
<ol>
<li>A problem statement about something you don&#x2019;t like.</li>
<li>A Vision statement about what an alternative would look like.</li>
<li>A Mission statement sharing what you&#x2019;ll value along the way.</li>
<li>A Plan of how to get there.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think having this kind of level of organization is good and will lead to more success for you since it&#x2019;s easy to define what you&#x2019;re working on.  You&#x2019;ll find the right people along the way.</p>
