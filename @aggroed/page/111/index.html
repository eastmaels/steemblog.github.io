        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmd7r2p2y4MN9RuipiWvPnZYns2LJd3ZfqPdVLuNSXoisu/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For right now here&#x2019;s the tl:dr:  Take your post payout listed on steemit.com and multiply by 5.5.  That will tell you how many USD worth of Steem and SBD you&#x2019;re going to get for your post at the time of payout.  If you multiply by 5 this will give you a rough estimate of what it&#x2019;s worth in liquid rewards.</p>
<h2 id="Here&#x2019;s-the-deal"><a href="#Here&#x2019;s-the-deal" class="headerlink" title="Here&#x2019;s the deal "></a>Here&#x2019;s the deal </h2><h2></h2><p>When you look at a post and see the value that&#x2019;s not actually USD (even though there is a dollar sign there).  That number references post rewards, which is a combination of SBDs and SP that are going to be rewarded by the blockchain.  It&#x2019;s pretty complicated how it works so I thought I&#x2019;d break it down for you so that&#x2019;d you know what a post is worth.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m going to take my last post to payout as an example: <a href="https://steemit.com/mspwaves/@aggroed/minnow-mayor-town-hall-live-in-90-min" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/mspwaves/@aggroed/minnow-mayor-town-hall-live-in-90-min</a></p>
<p>The post payout was 142.01.  I&#x2019;m going to call the units here Pay (post payout)</p>
<p>As the author I received 113.79Pay.<br>As curators folks received 28.22Pay</p>
<p>From those author rewards due to conversions in the system those 113.79 Pay turn into 56.895 SBD and 33.448 Steem Power.  </p>
<p>(you&#x2019;ll notice that SBD is at exactly 50% of Pay is dolled out as SBD rewards, &#x201C;Rewards&#x201D; when you post initially says 50/50 but conversions set by the witnesses distort it from that)</p>
<p>SBDs are worth $12.8  USD at the time of writing this.  SP is worth 1.8.</p>
<p>So, from SBD I earned $728 USD.  From SP I earned $60USD.  For a grand total of $788.46.</p>
<p>So, if you&#x2019;re looking for a fast way to figure out what it&#x2019;s worth to you in USD simply take the post reward shown on the post and multiply by 5.5 and that will tell you roughly how much it&#x2019;s worth in USD (this number is undergoing a lot of change right now because SBDs and Steem values are bouncing a lot).  If you want to know what the liquid portion is worth just multiply post reards by 5.</p>

<p>This thing is subject to change so don&#x2019;t take this as certain forever.  Edit.  It would also seem that people like to edit google sheets to the point they are unusable&#x2026;</p>

<p>OOOOOOHHH BOY!  It&#x2019;s been a fun week.  You&#x2019;re watching the price of SBD start to moon.  I think I&#x2019;m in the minority in the USA that believes it&#x2019;s about to double within the week, but that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m thinking.  Should be fun.  HODL!!!</p>
<p>We had the Steem Panel Discussion this week.  Lots going on there.  Talk of SBDs and Witnesses and Bias- OH MY!</p>
<p>Just another crazy week in the land of crypto.  Anywho&#x2026; looking forward to my show that&#x2019;s going live in about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>You&#x2019;ve heard of ICO (Initial Coin Offering), but IVO should be a brand new term.  It stands for Initial Vote Offering and it&#x2019;s a funding mechanism that only exists on the Steem blockchain.  The idea is fairly simple.  For those looking to raise money (steem); particularly for those looking to elevate  capabilities on a project, you can sell votes in advance.  Essentially in exchange for money now one can trade  tokens that you can use to vote posts now or later, which are already backed by the steem you collected in the IVO.  </p>
<p>You can use the votes right away to get an immediate small return on your investment or you can wait.  Thus the risk is highly mitigated.  Through waiting you&#x2019;ll experience the benefit of project work on the account power so that when you spend the vote you&#x2019;ll get the benefit of the reward after the people that raised the money have done a lot of work.  Essentially the project will organically grow the account through posting and curation, and as an investor you&#x2019;ll see a handsome return on your investment by the time you&#x2019;re finally ready to use or sell the vote.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this.  Do you think that you can make more money holding your steem and steem power and posting with it, or do you think the team of people working on the project will earn faster than you as an individual.  Especially if you&#x2019;re not that active, don&#x2019;t like to post, or can&#x2019;t imagine putting in the time it takes to build a monster account here then this can be a way for you to invest.</p>
<h2 id="This-is-a-massive-financial-opportunity-for-the-platform"><a href="#This-is-a-massive-financial-opportunity-for-the-platform" class="headerlink" title="This is a massive financial opportunity for the platform "></a>This is a massive financial opportunity for the platform </h2><h2></h2><p>With SMTs and communities coming there are a lot of ways to buy equity into a system or simply form a group and become whales.  In a lot of those cases you have a substantial risk around the SMT and if it will be successful.  You may end up buying into tokens that don&#x2019;t ever gain traction (they may sky rocket too, but the risk is you lose your investment).  So, this is a different way to attract cash.  It has the benefit of far less risk because it&#x2019;s backed by Steem.  An IVO is <strong>immediately</strong> backed by an account with Steem Power and the ability to return your capital as soon as it&#x2019;s powered up.  </p>
<p>Why is this good for the platform?  Here is a way to pool capital, which will attract capital.  Business minded folk can be on the platform drop an IVO and have an account with more Steem they can use to upvote their own posts, and after the votes have been redeemed the account is free to use the steem power.  This should attract investors to the platform, which can raise the price, which in turn will help all of the active posters on the platform with higher post rewards!</p>
<h2 id="An-example-mspwaves"><a href="#An-example-mspwaves" class="headerlink" title="An example: mspwaves "></a>An example: mspwaves </h2><h2></h2><p>The Minnow Support Project has a streaming internet broadcast station called mspwaves.  A handful of people have delegated to it and brought the account to a 10kSP account.  Over time we&#x2019;re going to be looking to increase the capabilities of this station to provide additional media types to the platform.  In order to do that we may want to raise funds.  So, let&#x2019;s look at an example of mspwaves doing an IVO.</p>
<p>For starters the price listed below is set such that if you vote today you&#x2019;ll get your money back or close to it.  So, we&#x2019;ve done our best to reduce risk for you.  It&#x2019;s possible that the price of SBD or steem drops, but it&#x2019;s the same risk whether you hold it in your account or move it to an IVO.</p>
<p>Secondly, this would be a good example of a project to support.  It&#x2019;s a fully functional internet streaming station with 20 DJs, backed by the minnowsupport project, and the leadership of that is comprised of multiple top 20 and backup witnesses.  There&#x2019;s an actual project, team, and community around it.  As you saw it was able to host some of the biggest names on the platform during the Steem Panel Discussion.</p>
<p>This is a good project for the Steem blockchain to have it&#x2019;s own station, and it&#x2019;s a good business opportunity because with so many talented people working on it it&#x2019;s bound to grow.  We&#x2019;re still wrapping our heads around if we&#x2019;d actually do this just yet, but in theory this is a great way to raise funds today, that we can then use  to help grow the project.</p>
<h2 id="How-does-it-work-Think-of-Whaleshares"><a href="#How-does-it-work-Think-of-Whaleshares" class="headerlink" title="How does it work? Think of Whaleshares! "></a>How does it work? Think of Whaleshares! </h2><h2></h2><p>Thanks to the folks from Whaleshares and the BTS community we already have a pathway that&#x2019;s established and working for months to make this work.  In this example we can list a new token on BTS called mspwaves.  We could sell them in tranches of 10k steem.  The first tokens are cheapest because the account is smallest at that time.  Later tokens are more expensive because the account will have a larger and larger SP count on it and will be able to create higher rewards on posts.</p>
<p>Until 50% of the tokens have been redeemed or 3 months have passed the issuer won&#x2019;t use the account to upvote anything other than it&#x2019;s own posts.  After that projects have a few options.  You&#x2019;ll have to see how the experiment is running, but you could start upvoting project team members, paying them in upvote tokens, and/or distribute to users you&#x2019;re trying to attract (for mspwaves we could give them to audience participants).</p>

<p>I think ultimately my favorite reason to start today is after I participated in the Storm token sale.  That thing took a month to get through.  On day one SMTs are released they are released, but you&#x2019;re probably not ready.  You still need to get a website out, form a team, figure out the ratio, and have a giant plan in place.  That takes months of prep to do well to have a really successful raise.  So, if you want to be ready for SMTs on day 1 the best thing to do is fiddle with an example using BTS and see where that baby goes.</p>
<h2 id="Why-wait-until-SMTs"><a href="#Why-wait-until-SMTs" class="headerlink" title="Why wait until SMTs "></a>Why wait until SMTs </h2><h2></h2><p>This keeps all the proceeds on the current platform.<br>This keeps all the buying pressure on Steem.<br>Knowing exactly how SMTs take shape will give the closest approximation to what they become.<br>Better relations with Steemcentric whales.</p>

Mspwaves has 10kSP on it currently so that&#x2019;s where the starting value comes from.  Each round would add another 10kSP to the bot, so the vote value goes up, so the price goes up.  It doesn&#x2019;t currently include some of the tokens sticking with the founders, but that might be an option too.  It&#x2019;s just an example.  It&#x2019;s yet to be seen if we actualy try this with mspwaves.</p>

<h2 id="Other-logistics"><a href="#Other-logistics" class="headerlink" title="Other logistics "></a>Other logistics </h2><h2></h2><p>Not everyone is a BTS investor.  So, it&#x2019;s likely you&#x2019;d need tutorials and also a Discord group to show people how to do it and talk about it.  You probably need some live meetings during the sale to talk through how it would work.  If you end up trying something like this then be sure to come on the Minnow Mayor Town Hall to talk about your plans!  It&#x2019;s Sunday nights from 8-11pm est (0100-0400 UTC).</p>

Since the vote values are shooting sky high you can actually raise money with this.  So, kudos to high SBDs and thanks to Korean pumpers looking to maximize their value of SBD.</p>

<p>So, on the Steem Panel Discussion today we talked some about the state of the economy, and one of the points of discussion was the sudden spike in the price of SBD.  There are many voices calling for Steemit and the witnesses to alter the economics and attempt to drive the price back to 1USD / 1SBD.  There are good reasons to do that, but I&#x2019;m of the opinion that we should enjoy the SBD being high, it&#x2019;s good and egalitarian for the platform, and the plan should be to do absolutely nothing about it.  Not a damn thing!</p>
<h2 id="Options-I&#x2019;ve-heard"><a href="#Options-I&#x2019;ve-heard" class="headerlink" title="Options I&#x2019;ve heard "></a>Options I&#x2019;ve heard </h2><h2></h2><p>&#x201C;Get rid of the SBD&#x201D; - Literally stop having them be an option&#x2026; hard to implement given that 3.6M are already outstanding, but it would make Steem and Steem power the only things on the platform.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Print more SBDs&#x201D; - Do things like allow 75% payout in SBD or witness production rewards in sbd.  This should lower the price by increasing the supply.  Neat ideas, but this also adds more SBD, which is a debt instrument to the platform and could have negative consequences down the road.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Change the Bias&#x201D; - This is a witness setting that works as a platform ratio, tweaking it higher can produce more SBD, but also weakens conversion of SBD into steem (and it&#x2019;s already a 90% loss if you convert).  This feels like a band aid that isn&#x2019;t worth it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Let SBD be converted back into Steem&#x201D; - this is probably the most popular option and it would allow a direct conversion of steem into SBD, which would allow Steem the ability to capture the rise in SBD price.  I&#x2019;m against this because I want the value going to the posters as opposed to the historic owners of steem power.</p>
<h2 id="Overall-goal"><a href="#Overall-goal" class="headerlink" title="Overall goal "></a>Overall goal </h2><h2></h2><p>People want their account value to rise.  As much as this platform has great values (moral) we also are trying to extract value (financial) from it.  Naturally folks want the value of wallets to rise and that means Steem and potentially SBD rising in value.</p>
<p>I want the value of steem to rise, but here&#x2019;s my challenge.  The distribution of steem is extremely warped.  93% of the steem is in less than 1% of the accounts.  That&#x2019;s not a good distribution.  Even feudalism didn&#x2019;t have that, and while I love nearly everything this platform I truly hate that piece of it.  That&#x2019;s the distribution of Steem, but not the distribution of SBDs.  SBDs are tied to author rewards more than historic Steem ownership and so the distribution of those can be approximated to this <a href="steemdata.com">graph</a>.  </p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmT1tqM9jUVAwrvToJKSKDib9oTAVqop3ys3tC5HnFFStF/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That graph doesn&#x2019;t quite show the whole story as it doesn&#x2019;t really show how many of those post rewards are created by the bid bots and that money then flows back to the primary steem holders, but it&#x2019;s one of the best representations that I have available.  And it&#x2019;ll have to do.  Bid bots are only about 5% of the SP so that graph doesn&#x2019;t quite show that @freedom and @blocktrades and maybe a few others are getting fat paychecks from this, but at least we know that it&#x2019;s not 25 accounts that earn it all on post rewards.</p>
<h2 id="My-option"><a href="#My-option" class="headerlink" title="My option "></a>My option </h2><h2></h2><p>Do nothing and HODL!  The price of SBD will rise and rise a ton.  that&#x2019;s because we&#x2019;re trying to fuel an internet worth of commerce with 3.6M tokens that barely change amount in a given year.  So&#x2026; those fuckers are gonna keep skyrocketing if we don&#x2019;t change it.  Personally I like that idea.  It&#x2019;s going to help this place grow.  At some point you&#x2019;re going to buy a house with 10k SBD, and it&#x2019;ll be a nice house.  This is a good thing for the posters on the platform and if we keep attracting posters to the platform that&#x2019;s ultimately good for the steem investors too.</p>
<h2 id="Why-do-we-have-Steem-and-SBDs"><a href="#Why-do-we-have-Steem-and-SBDs" class="headerlink" title="Why do we have Steem and SBDs? "></a>Why do we have Steem and SBDs? </h2><h2></h2><p>When this platform first started bitcoin wasn&#x2019;t at $15kUSD/coin.  Most people didn&#x2019;t know shit about the space, and no one had any idea why we should be looking at these things.  The creators of the platform decided at the very least we were going to need something pretty familiar to money used every day to have it make any sense.  So, they created the SBD.  This was also at the time when they were using vests, which most of you may not have even heard of and vests eventually turned into Steem Power on the front end (though vests are still used in the backend).  </p>
<p>From the start SBD was intended to always be worth a dollar worth of steem, but free markets being free markets, have made SBD something closer to the following definition: a unit of exchange worth a minimum of $1 USD worth of Steem.  Witnesses can mostly guarantee a minimum of $1 USD worth of Steem by using the fact that SBD is a debt instrument.  The block can literally award people interest in steem as the currency for those holding SBD.  So when the price of SBD dips below $1 USD the witnesses can raise interest rates to make it more attractive and award the SBD holders a larger and larger portion of the inflationary awards on the system until we get back to a 1USD/1SBD valuation.</p>
<h2 id="A-Peg"><a href="#A-Peg" class="headerlink" title="A Peg "></a>A Peg </h2><h2></h2><p>It was supposed to be a peg to make transactions easier on the web.  Not only can you do fast transactions without any fees using SBDs, but you can rest easy that they are worth $1USD today of Steem and will be a week from now.  From a merchant stand point what you really want is a stable currency.  You want to be able to buy and sell goods at prices that don&#x2019;t fluctuate much.  You want it so when you order cotton to make your shirt that there isn&#x2019;t a 10x swing in the price of cotton or the shirts as it&#x2019;s really freaking hard to run a business on that.</p>
<p>A major challenge to the price stability is the supply.  There&#x2019;s only 3.6 Million of these coins in existence.  That&#x2019;s like 1/7th the number of bitcoins.  There really aren&#x2019;t that many of these suckers.  So, it doesn&#x2019;t take a lot of buying activity to push the price up and up and up!  Recently we saw a Korean exchange start trading Steem and SBD and since that happened they&#x2019;ve purchased over $8M USD worth of coins, and we&#x2019;re seeing the effect in the price of SBD and steem.</p>
<p>So, free markets being free markets and with there only 3.6M of these babies in existence we&#x2019;re getting a spike.  I&#x2019;m not ready to call this a pump.  I think it may actually be a new normal, and just the beginning of this depending on how the platform and the witnesses move forward.  The supply increases about 23k/day right now, but they can also be destroyed through converting to steem (don&#x2019;t do this now or you&#x2019;ll lose 90% of the value of your sbd), promoting a post, or lost on the interwebs.  So, if we do nothing I think the answer is that the price will continue to rise and rise!</p>
<h2 id="Benefit-of-rising-price"><a href="#Benefit-of-rising-price" class="headerlink" title="Benefit of rising price "></a>Benefit of rising price </h2><h2></h2><p>Post rewards are going through the roof.  High post rewards (especially if we switch the condenser frontend to show the value in USD instead of SBD) will bring an assload of people to Steem, which will fuel more growth, which should push the price higher!</p>
<h2 id="Fiat-inflation-wars"><a href="#Fiat-inflation-wars" class="headerlink" title="Fiat inflation wars "></a>Fiat inflation wars </h2><h2></h2><p>If you pay attention to politics in the world there&#x2019;s a lot of emphasis on currency manipulation.  A government takes out a loan, and then they want massive amounts of inflation so it&#x2019;s easier to pay it off.  Banks are happy with inflation because it&#x2019;s easier to get higher loan amounts and ultimately leads to huge amounts of debt payments.  Big companies want low dollar values typically so they can export things more cheaply and capture return basically by devaluing labor in the country.  The people that don&#x2019;t want inflation are the normal pleabs.  Especially with flat wages it just means you&#x2019;re gonna have to take on a second or third job to pay your bills.</p>
<h2 id="Deflation"><a href="#Deflation" class="headerlink" title="Deflation "></a>Deflation </h2><h2></h2><p>The banks will tell you that deflation is horrible and the sky will fall, but if you&#x2019;re brand new here let me be the first to tell you that those bankers are assholes.  </p>
<p>I want to hold a currency and wait a year and be able to purchase more groceries with them, which is the exact opposite of what we have now.  This type of deflation is good for the people.  It&#x2019;s great for the platform.  It&#x2019;s gonna make posters on here millionaires.  </p>
<h2 id="The-challenge-of-a-floating-SBD"><a href="#The-challenge-of-a-floating-SBD" class="headerlink" title="The challenge of a floating SBD "></a>The challenge of a floating SBD </h2><h2></h2><p>This makes it a challenge to sell things with SBD.  A strong currency hurts exports, but at the moment we don&#x2019;t really have any other than entertainment, so I&#x2019;m not worried about killing a Steem car industry.  So, for us, there isn&#x2019;t a down side to high SBDs.  And we lost the peg&#x2026; so what, there isnt&#x2019; a ton of commerce on the platform anyway so who cares?  Peerhubs exists, but they can just as easily list prices in USD which is relatively stable because of the volume of it, but still accept steem and SBD as payment.  </p>
<p>We dont&#x2019; have 8 million steem backed merchants, and the ones we do have already have tools to convert between USD, Euros, SBD, steem, btc, and all the other coins that they may have to deal in.  My point is that the people hurt the most by a fluctuating currency are the merchants, but the good news is that we don&#x2019;t have that many, but we do have 30k active users looking to earn money by blogging.  So, let&#x2019;s help them!</p>
<h2 id="The-skinny"><a href="#The-skinny" class="headerlink" title="The skinny "></a>The skinny </h2><h2></h2><p>The short answer is that we&#x2019;re not really hurting anyone with a high sbd, it&#x2019;s going to attract new people here, and it&#x2019;s nice to get paid in a way that supports the active community rather than the original steem holders, which don&#x2019;t have a nice distribution in my eyes.</p>
<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-my-conclusion"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-my-conclusion" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s my conclusion? "></a>What&#x2019;s my conclusion? </h2><h2></h2><p>Don&#x2019;t do shit.  Don&#x2019;t print more sbd, don&#x2019;t convert back and forth, don&#x2019;t change the bias.  Do write and post more and enjoy the rewards, do change the website to display in other currencies, do enjoy having a strong dollar, and enjoy being able to purchase other coins more cheaply from highly rewarded posts.</p>
<h2 id="What-if-SBD-crashes"><a href="#What-if-SBD-crashes" class="headerlink" title="What if SBD crashes? "></a>What if SBD crashes? </h2><h2></h2><p>That&#x2019;s different.  I would support raising interest on sbd to support a $1 point again so that we meet the promise of a minimum of $1, but I&#x2019;m pretty sure we shouldn&#x2019;t do anything to change how SBD functions and just enjoy the ride and high price.</p>
