<p>As promised I said I would increase my delegation to @msp-active to 10k.  I just did that tonight.  It was up from 5,000 when I started the account.  I had to wait until some of the personal delegations I had removed came back to me.</p>
<h2 id="auto-votes"><a href="#auto-votes" class="headerlink" title="auto-votes "></a>auto-votes </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;ve put a number of people onto auto-votes.  These are folks that are active in PALnet, chilling in radio shows on msp-waves, or helping in other ways.  If you&#x2019;re not getting these votes and you think that you should contact me in Discord.  Put together a 1-2 sentence pitch on what value you offer to the Minnow Support Project Community housed in the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Discord channel and I&#x2019;ll evaluate.</p>
<h2 id="Vote-Ranges"><a href="#Vote-Ranges" class="headerlink" title="Vote Ranges "></a>Vote Ranges </h2><h2></h2><p>Most of the voting percentages are between 5-25%.  The highest I think I&#x2019;m doing is 50%.  While the vote percentages are indeed a little small it&#x2019;s worth noting that the account voting power is currently hovering around 98%.  So, it&#x2019;s a smaller vote with a stronger overall account vote power.</p>
<h2 id="General-rules"><a href="#General-rules" class="headerlink" title="General rules "></a>General rules </h2><h2></h2><p>An occasional shit post isn&#x2019;t the worst thing ever, especially for a minnow, but if you are found to continue to put out low quality content to take advantage of the auto votes I&#x2019;m removing you from it.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re putting out content that advocate for violence I&#x2019;ll take you off of it.</p>
<p>If you get banned from PALnet I&#x2019;ll take you off of it.</p>
<p>This is my SP.  I&#x2019;m doing this as a service.  I reserve the right to end the service if people seem to treat the benefit with disrespect.</p>
<h2 id="Next-set-of-delegations"><a href="#Next-set-of-delegations" class="headerlink" title="Next set of delegations "></a>Next set of delegations </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m at 8k active SP now.  I&#x2019;d like to be closer to 15k.  I&#x2019;m going to build up my VP to not only 15k, but then add another 5k on top.  When I get to 20k I&#x2019;ll delegate 1-5k to one of the major projects within MSP.  I&#x2019;ll continue adding more and more SP into projects through July/August.  Then I&#x2019;m going to shave off some, start powering down more, and try to catch what seems to be the annual pump in December.  I&#x2019;ll try to buy back in for even more stake in Jan/Feb and then delegate to higher amounts than I have previously.</p>
<p>The four accounts I plan on pumping are msp-mods, msp-curation, msp-active, and msp-waves.  The primary account @minnowsupport has 18k SP on it that&#x2019;s organic and another 100k that&#x2019;s delegated to it.  As long as the other 4 accounts are underneath the amount of organic SP on the mothership account I plan on increasing delegations to those.</p>
<h2 id="2-ways-to-have-enough"><a href="#2-ways-to-have-enough" class="headerlink" title="2 ways to have enough "></a>2 ways to have enough </h2><h2></h2><p>You can constantly strive for more wealth to fill an ever larger and upward level of greed or you can be content with what you have and own.  I&#x2019;m going for the latter.  My family has enough to live a comfortable existence.  The goal is to spread abundance, and that means helping others.  I&#x2019;m planning to be in this for the long haul and helping to build a better world and I&#x2019;ll put my SP to the task to do that.  Thank you for your support.  </p>
<h2 id="Witness-Votes"><a href="#Witness-Votes" class="headerlink" title="Witness Votes "></a>Witness Votes </h2><h2></h2><p>Sorry to keep shilling my Witness.  I know that many people support me and I&#x2019;m fortunate to be a top 20 witness.  Recently I&#x2019;ve moved down from rank 7 to 11.  It&#x2019;s important to stick with the campaign so that I can continue to provide revenue towards the mission of the Minnow Support Project-  Spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, help the Steem ecosystem grow, and train and retain minnows (new members) on the platform.</p>
<p>If you think those goals and my approach to them are worth please consider voting for me if you haven&#x2019;t already.</p>

            <p>@ned says the plan is to have over 100k new businesses start up using the Steem blockchain.  Some of these will be revolutionary new blockchain companies.  Others will be traditional businesses that incorporate Steem payments.  Today I&#x2019;m happy to introduce you to Eye Heart Organic.</p>
<h2 id="A-homestead-farm-stand-and-grow-op"><a href="#A-homestead-farm-stand-and-grow-op" class="headerlink" title="A homestead, farm stand, and grow op "></a>A homestead, farm stand, and grow op </h2><h2></h2><p>These guys are still in their business infancy at this one business location so it&#x2019;s not going to knock your socks off just yet, but you can see it.  The guy talking is @movement19 and the website is: <a href="https://eyeheartorganic.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://eyeheartorganic.wordpress.com/</a></p>
<p>There is a main farm house, a big barn with an attached greenhouse, and a second greenhouse under partial construction.  The plan is to grow seedlings in the attached greenhouse, grow organic food and the legal limit of medical marijuana plants in the second greenhouse, have a small aquaponics setup in the garage of the barn that also will double as a farmstand. </p>
<p>They&#x2019;ll take food from other vendors in the area and sell in the common area.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/i6aylrxc8n8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://youtu.be/i6aylrxc8n8</a></p>
<p>They also want to sponsor various events.  They&#x2019;ll have a cannabis hang out lounge that&#x2019;s part of the facility.  it seems like a good time all around.</p>
<h2 id="The-farm-was-preexisting-but-in-handyman-shape"><a href="#The-farm-was-preexisting-but-in-handyman-shape" class="headerlink" title="The farm was preexisting, but in handyman shape "></a>The farm was preexisting, but in handyman shape </h2><h2></h2><p>There&#x2019;s 4 kids on the property.  They are all being unschooled there.  Here are folks working on the barn.  Still a little time before planting the seedlings starts so they have some time to finish up.</p>

<p>They are building organic grow beds.  The plan is to have the soil take care of itself through good planting and rotation rather than simply dumping chemicals in to replenish the soil they remove all the nutrients from.</p>

<p>The sceneary is pretty nice.  They have a stream literally right behind the property.  It makes me a little nervous with kids, but there are a fair number of adults and children on the property and people have managed to live by rivers for eons without all the kids dying.</p>

<p>Here&#x2019;s a picture of the farmhouse with some of the mini vehicles that are on the property.  Kids are playing non stop inside and outside.  It&#x2019;s nice to see how the old farm houses were probably run.</p>

<p>This is the garage.  It&#x2019;s going to host the aquaponics facility and also the farm stand.  It&#x2019;s a good mix.  People will want to see the fishies and start asking questions like &#x201C;what&#x2019;s the fish and vegetables doing together?&#x201D;</p>

<p>I got a bit of the shakes so the focus sucks, but here&#x2019;s the attached greenhouse that they got.  It&#x2019;s a little small but should work great as a little nursery to get them started.  It&#x2019;s March, but it was warm in there.</p>
<h2 id="Taking-Steem"><a href="#Taking-Steem" class="headerlink" title="Taking Steem "></a>Taking Steem </h2><h2></h2><p>This project have @movement19 as the VP of marketing for the project.  He&#x2019;s a Steemian.  The plan is to accept Steem for what they sell and barter, or for memberships for growop side of things.  So, to me this represents a pretty unique business that&#x2019;s a testament to the Liberty future and a throwback to the healthy past.  We have a multi-family homestead, creating a sustainable zero waste farm using up to date organic farming techniques and aquaponics.  They are going to accept the people&#x2019;s currency ie cryptocurrency, and they are pushing the business limits by running a growop at the same time.  </p>
<p>So, here we go.  Here&#x2019;s your future headed throwback small business that&#x2019;s going to help power the Steem economy.  I&#x2019;m looking forward to supporting them as they get crops up and running.  As I learned from Steemit it should be &#x201C;soon.&#x201D;</p>
<h2 id="Witness-work"><a href="#Witness-work" class="headerlink" title="Witness work "></a>Witness work </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m not programmer.  I do manage some program work to help make tools that enable community building, but the community building itself is my witness agenda.  This is a good example.  If you think that bringing a small organic farming business to the Steem ecosystem is helpful for our community at large then please consider voting for me.  This is my commitment:</p>
<p>I promise to help spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.<br>To help grow the Steem ecosystem.<br>To train and retain minnows on the platform.</p>

<p>Toying around with this new logo.  Working with a new introduction.  The music is still by @soundwavesphoton cause it&#x2019;s severely dope as fuck.  The video work is by @hardikv.  Check it out. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nNPF8D8ke0&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nNPF8D8ke0&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>
<h2 id="What-is-the-Minnow-Mayor-Town-Hall"><a href="#What-is-the-Minnow-Mayor-Town-Hall" class="headerlink" title="What is the Minnow Mayor Town Hall? "></a>What is the Minnow Mayor Town Hall? </h2><h2></h2><p>So, I founded the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord server.  It houses the Minnow Support Project, which is a witness run public organization that is designed to live up to the mission: Spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, help grow the Steem ecosystem, and train and retain minnows on the platform.</p>
<p>Within that a team built a streaming internet broadcast station called MSP-Waves.  The station now has 16+ DJs and over 30 hours a week of content on the station.  I have three shows that I run. </p>
<p>I run the Peace Academy with @isaria.  It&#x2019;s a show designed to help people figure out how to apply the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty in their lives.  That show airs on Saturday nights at 9pm EST (0200 UTC)</p>
<p>I run a Saturday morning panel discussion every week.  It&#x2019;s a rotating forum.  The second Saturday of every month is Sounds of Steem and we bring on the amazingly talented musicians from the Steem network to perform live.  I also run the Steem Panel Discussion on the last Saturday of every month.  I gather top 20 witnesses and some backup witness, maybe Steemit employees, and a handful of whales and get to talking about what&#x2019;s happening on the Steem network.  The other Saturday&#x2019;s I pick a demographic on the block along any line that interests me and gather people up.  Next week is music, the week after that is unknown&#x2026; maybe fiction writers, week after that is MSP moderators, and after that is the Witness again.</p>
<h2 id="MSP15k"><a href="#MSP15k" class="headerlink" title="MSP15k "></a>MSP15k </h2><h2></h2><p>It started a while back, but when we hit something like 5,000 Steemians in PALnet I made a post saying we were a city and I was it&#x2019;s mayor.  I&#x2019;m sticking with the riff.  We&#x2019;re up to nearly 15,000 Steemians.  We&#x2019;re probably going to hit it this week.  We hand out 2-4 thousand votes a day from @minnowsupport, which thanks to some epicly awesome people has around 125k steem power that it uses to award minnows who are just starting.</p>
<p>As part of that I decided that we need more transparency from elected witnesses, Steemit Inc employees, and more communication across the network as a whole.  I created a music show at first, but once I figured out how to handle the show I turned it into a Town Hall format.  Anyone can come on and talk about anything.  We have very few rules, which basically amount to be intentionally rude or harmful to other people.  You&#x2019;re welcome to disagree with whatever, talk about whatever, promote whatever, and so on, but we have a pretty simple low bar that we don&#x2019;t bend.  Be at least professional, and try to be kind.</p>
<h2 id="You&#x2019;re-welcome-on-air"><a href="#You&#x2019;re-welcome-on-air" class="headerlink" title="You&#x2019;re welcome on air! "></a>You&#x2019;re welcome on air! </h2><h2></h2><p>So, I usually spend between 5-30 minutes talking to people on air.  Some folks come on and perform.  Some people come on and promote a cause or project.  Some newbies just want to introduce themselves.  Some people have a bone to pick with me.  It&#x2019;s all welcome.  I try to field questions the best I can and I try to help people in general.  A lot of folks that come on my show get resteems and their projects and accounts get a nice boost.</p>
<p>Simply put, people do business with people they know.  Once I know people I&#x2019;m far more likely to help them at least with resteems.  At the moment I can get around 35,000 accounts to see a post between @aggroed, @minnowsupport, and @lovejuice.  Sometimes I&#x2019;ll even pitch projects to whales and large follower accounts to get your stuff even more noticed or rewarded.  There&#x2019;s some overlap on those accounts, but the point is that it&#x2019;s a lot and especially minnows I can try to help catapult off to a nice start.</p>
<p>So, here&#x2019;s your chance.  Come talk to me.  Choose the topic.  Choose the act.  Choose the whatever.  You get at least 5 minutes and maybe more.  Just know this is &#x201C;Do no harm, but take no shit&#x201D; country.  If you come aggitated and looking for a fight you&#x2019;ll likely find yourself on the ban list.  Professional disagreements are welcome.  Personal attacks are not.  Got it?</p>
<h2 id="What-to-do"><a href="#What-to-do" class="headerlink" title="What to do? "></a>What to do? </h2><h2></h2><p>Hop into <a href="minnowpond.org">PALnet Discord</a>.<br>Register if you haven&#x2019;t (you get dmed instructions).<br>Then join the mspwaves-audience channel or to skip all that just listen via mspwaves.com/listen.<br>There&#x2019;s a text channel too so you can interact with me or the guests.</p>
<h2 id="Dice-Bitches"><a href="#Dice-Bitches" class="headerlink" title="Dice Bitches "></a>Dice Bitches </h2><h2></h2><p>Some time during the show we&#x2019;ll play dice.  Should be fun!  25 SBD is up for grabs.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s the deal.</p>
<p>I roll, then you roll.<br>If you tie or beat my roll you go onto the next round.<br>If you don&#x2019;t tie or beat my roll don&#x2019;t roll again.</p>
<p>If I win once we play again.  If I win twice I&#x2019;ll host a 1 time roll off.</p>
<p>How to roll <code>t!dice 10d10</code> in the first round <code>t!dice 9d9</code> in the second round and so on.</p>
<h2 id="Delegation"><a href="#Delegation" class="headerlink" title="Delegation "></a>Delegation </h2><h2></h2><p>I changed my mind on personal delegations.  I don&#x2019;t think they did what I wanted them to do.  So I&#x2019;m switching to delegating to an account called @msp-active.  It has 5k on it now.  It should have 10k on it soon.  I add people that are active listeners or active chat participants in PALnet.  Delegators to Minnow Support Project projects can get higher amounts, active people get higher votes, and I reserve the right to boost or diminish vote values whenever.</p>
<p>If you feel like you contribute a lot to mspwaves listenership or are an active chatter but aren&#x2019;t getting the vote contact me in Discord.  Give me a 1-2 setence description of what you do and why you should be on it.  I&#x2019;ll review it.</p>
<h2 id="In-the-comments-below"><a href="#In-the-comments-below" class="headerlink" title="In the comments below "></a>In the comments below </h2><h2></h2><p>Lemme know what you think of the new logo and intro.  I&#x2019;m excited to see what you have to say.</p>
<h2 id="Dlive"><a href="#Dlive" class="headerlink" title="Dlive "></a>Dlive </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m gonna try using dlive tonight.  Looks like I can run two OBS instances simultaneously and send a feed to both.  Should be fun!  We&#x2019;ll see how that goes.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve shared that my Uncle died just a few days ago.  It was a mix of hard living and poor dietary choices that led to several strokes, and ultimately a heart attack.  He was in his late 70s or early 80s.  I should know, but I don&#x2019;t keep those dates in my head all that well.  He lived the life he wanted to live for the time period he wanted to live it and then had a relatively short and sharp drop decline to the end of his life.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m a little sheepish about this tradition I&#x2019;ve set.  It&#x2019;s filled with privilege for one because it&#x2019;s expensive, but it also strikes me as being weird.  Really&#x2026; I mean, who fucking goes sky diving to take an emotional load off.  Anyway, it strikes me as weird&#x2026; that said I want to share it anyway.  So, I&#x2019;m hard on myself for this anyway, but also feeling a touch defensive about it.</p>
<h2 id="My-aunt"><a href="#My-aunt" class="headerlink" title="My aunt  "></a>My aunt  </h2><h2></h2><p>I heard about my uncle&#x2019;s passing.  I think I was in shock for a few days.  I spoke to him a few days before he died.  He started hospice and I knew this was coming (even though I thought it woudl be months away) so I don&#x2019;t feel like a terrible nephew, but it&#x2019;s hard to see that side of my family die especially after my mom&#x2019;s death.  I didn&#x2019;t communicate as frequently as I should have cause it triggers me and makes me relive her dying of cancer.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I called my aunt and didn&#x2019;t reach her, and she called me back right before my lesson / flight time.  It&#x2019;s like the universe was precisely facilitating my ritual.  She kinda walked me through how he died and for the first time since I heard he died I could get some tears out.</p>
<h2 id="Flying"><a href="#Flying" class="headerlink" title="Flying "></a>Flying </h2><h2></h2><p>I then went in and did five 2 minute sessions.  2 minutes sounds short, but the closest thing I can think of is when i wrestled in high school and the periods were 2 exhausting minutes.  I&#x2019;m like 240 pounds.  It takes some physical work even with the wind doing most of the work to hold me up.  So, it&#x2019;s a little bit mentally challenging to balance and feel ones body and navigate the wind.  It was emotionally relieving.  I like feeling like I&#x2019;m floating and I like breathing the wind shooting into my lungs at 100+ mph.  The phrase take a breath of fresh air is amplified at those speeds!</p>
<h2 id="Defenses-down"><a href="#Defenses-down" class="headerlink" title="Defenses down "></a>Defenses down </h2><h2></h2><p>When the whole thing was over and I was in my car I finally could let some go.  When I was in graduate school I had the hardest time of my life.  I was literally working around 100 hours a week.  I would take every other Sunday afternoon off and otherwise I was working from around 9am in the morning to 11pm at night.  I did that for 8 months so I could graduate and get to the job that was waiting for me.  I worked at that clip and it was literally killing me.  I would get in there and dealt with a million stresses.  My wife would tell me to get her the fuck out of Texas, work would tell me to hurry up as the job wouldn&#x2019;t be there forever, and my boss would tell me I&#x2019;d never make it on time.  The stress was gruesome.  I used to leave my fume hood (I&#x2019;m a chemist), walk into the adjacent lab that was vacant, cry for a good 5-10 minutes, and then go back at it.  I didn&#x2019;t have enough time to waste more than that.  Toss in a friend&#x2019;s suicide and coping through heavy drinking and I was in a bad way.  </p>
<h2 id="Processing"><a href="#Processing" class="headerlink" title="Processing "></a>Processing </h2><h2></h2><p>Anyway, the point of that is that because of time constraints it changed the way I cry to intense 5-10 minute bouts and then life goes on.  I was in my truck right after flying and the wave hit.  My uncle lived near Austin.  So, when I went to grad school down in Texas he lent me a car, let me stay at his house, my wife and I would visit.  He was a fan a supporter.  I don&#x2019;t want to share too much because I want to write an obit for him, but this week has been a real struggle for me.  I&#x2019;m down to just 2 people living in the generation above mine, and while I wasn&#x2019;t super close to my Uncle I certainly felt loved and grateful for the time I spent with him.  He could be a little stoic and hard to know.  That&#x2019;s my mother&#x2019;s side of the family for sure, but even through stoic I felt a lot of love, which I&#x2019;ll truly miss going forward.</p>
<h2 id="Vulnerable"><a href="#Vulnerable" class="headerlink" title="Vulnerable "></a>Vulnerable </h2><h2></h2><p>So, here I am sorta at my worst just trying to let the wind take a load off.  I try to be a strong, balanced and neutral leader as much as I can be for as long as I can be.  That often means keeping parts of me at arms length from this place, from people I care about, from members of PALnet, and my digital homestead.  That said I love this place and I love being a part of this community and wanted to share a touch of weakness and vulnerability.  I&#x2019;m not always the image of the guy I put out there.  Sometimes I&#x2019;m just a sad nephew dearly missing a beloved and supporting uncle.  It&#x2019;s just being.  It&#x2019;s just me.  I thought I&#x2019;d share what that&#x2019;s like at the tough times.</p>
<p>Steem is the broken hearts club.  Here&#x2019;s another piece of my heart ripped off.  I&#x2019;m betting folks can relate, and I&#x2019;m hoping this can positively impact at least one other person to hear this story and see the approach even if it is a little off the wall and in the air.  Much love Steem.  I&#x2019;ve gotten some very supportive comments and kindness.  It matters and thanks for your caring.  Please keep my family in your prayers for a bit.</p>
<p>Namaste,</p>

<p>The Boston meetup was a success.  I&#x2019;ll share more details shortly.  I have a variety of posts to make and that I&#x2019;m behind on.  Se la Vie.  Ok, onto my last project of the day: THE PEACE ACADEMY!</p>

<p>Last week @isaria was out of town so I had @r0nd0n on the show to talk about Liberty.</p>
<p>This week I want to talk a bit about victim mentality&#x2026;.how to become more empowered and also how to deal with others who exhibit victim mentality and other toxic behaviors.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve also experienced the passing of a loved one this week so we may talk about dealing with grief as well.</p>
<p>An abundance discussion may also be in order as I&#x2019;ve noticed a bit of negativity in the air here and there.<br>This is often a result of having a scarcity mindset which is fear based.<br>Let&#x2019;s spend some time focusing on all the positive that is going on around us here on Steemit.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you all tonight!</p>

<p>I got a busy day lined up for you.  We&#x2019;re starting off with Steem Visions.  It&#x2019;s a Saturday morning panel discussion hosted by @stellabelle and @juliakponsford.  We&#x2019;ve lined up some great artists to present their work and talk about it.  I&#x2019;m excited to share this with you!  I&#x2019;ll play some music starting in about an hour to give people time to come into the <a href="minnowpond.org">Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Discord Channel</a>.  The show starts at 11am EST (90 min from when this posts, and 1600 UTC).</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s the <a href="https://steemit.com/art/@aggroed/steem-visions-an-artist-discussion-and-online-exhibit-hosted-with-stellabelle-and-juliakponsford-boston-meetup-saturday" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major details to Steem Visions!</a></p>
<p>Guests include:<br>@elohprojects<br>@everlove<br>@yusaymon<br>@poeticsnake<br>@overkillcoin<br>@alexandravart<br>@denniskonstantin<br>@mrblinddraw<br>@paolobeneforti<br>@drawingly<br>@reinhard-schmid<br>@zipporah</p>
<p>Hosts include: @stellabelle and @juliakponsford.</p>
<h2 id="Boston-Meetup"><a href="#Boston-Meetup" class="headerlink" title="Boston Meetup "></a>Boston Meetup </h2><h2></h2><p>After this morning&#x2019;s presentation I&#x2019;m going into Boston to host a meetup.  It&#x2019;s not too late to join us.  It&#x2019;s all happening on Beacon St in Brookline.  We&#x2019;re going to start by getting some Sushi at 2pm and we&#x2019;ll wrap up by playing some board games at Knight Moves.</p>
<p>You can find the details for the <a href="https://mspsteem.com/meetup/@aggroed/boston-meetup-this-saturday" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boston meetup here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Peace-Academy"><a href="#Peace-Academy" class="headerlink" title="Peace Academy "></a>Peace Academy </h2><h2></h2><p>Ok, wrapping up a busy Saturday is the Peace Academy.  At 9pm EST (0200 UTC) I&#x2019;ll have just gotten home from Brookline and I&#x2019;ll dive right in with my cohost @isaria and we&#x2019;ll talk about how to live in state of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  This week will likely include a discussion of dealing with grief and how to break free from a victim mentality.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;ll be doing this online at <a href="https://mspwaves.com/listen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">msp-waves</a> and in <a href="minnowpond.org">Discord</a>.  I hope to see you there!</p>
<h2 id="Witness-work"><a href="#Witness-work" class="headerlink" title="Witness work "></a>Witness work </h2><h2></h2><p>Witnesses are two things.  They are a server and a person running the server.  The server&#x2019;s job is to responsibly and ethically create the blockchain.  Servers have to stay up to date and not attempt to put fake transactions to enrich individuals into the block.  As for people they typically fall into the category of developer or community builder.  Most of the witnesses in the top 20 are developers.  A handful are community builders.  There&#x2019;s 1-2 unicorns in there that can do both.</p>
<p>All of these kinds of projects listed above represent contributions I&#x2019;m making to add value to the Steem blockchain.  The goals remain the same since I started my Witness campaign: Spread the Values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, Help Steem grow, and Train and Retain Minnows on the Platform.  If you like what I&#x2019;m doing and what I stand for I would ask that you consider voting for my <a href="steemit.com/~witnesses">witness</a>.</p>
<h2 id="The-law-of-intensifying-bullshit"><a href="#The-law-of-intensifying-bullshit" class="headerlink" title="The law of intensifying bullshit "></a>The law of intensifying bullshit </h2><h2></h2><p>This is a rough week.  Normally in my life when bad things happen it tends to pour in.  I&#x2019;m gonna try keep my shit together, but this week saw my uncle die.  He was the last remaining member of my mother&#x2019;s side of that generation.  Down to me, my brother and two cousins&#x2026;  I&#x2019;m now down to my Dad and his sister as the remaining members of the generation above mine.  It&#x2019;s a lonely feeling.  Anyway, please send my family some love, prayers, white light, or whatever.  It&#x2019;s a rough time, and if today doesn&#x2019;t go perfectly that seems likely to be part of the day&#x2019;s plan.  Please bear with me.</p>
