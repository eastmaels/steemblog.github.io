<p>I went on a hike near my house.  Sat down at the peek and while having a popcorn snack the family realized we were a few feet from this bird.  It basically sat there unmoving while we had a popcorn break.  It gave us the stink eye the whole time.  I went to get the uber closeup.  Here is the result.</p>

<p>Side note all hell is breaking loose on the blockchain today.  Some notable flags I&#x2019;ll be mentioning soon.  Also a ton of technology failures that I can see the Devs working on and the witnesses talking about.  For some of the bot services they aren&#x2019;t going to be available because they rely on a a steem node that&#x2019;s down.  @minnowsupport is one example.  I&#x2019;m assuming mercury is in retrograde.</p>

<p>Imagine if you will the late 1990s and early 2000s.  I&#x2019;ve recently graduated from a world renowned high school.  I was league MVP for wrestling.  I was cut, handsome, arrogant, bright, had the world at my finger tips, and a future so bright I had to wear shades&#x2026;</p>
<p>Upon entering college one of my best friends in the world suggested to me &#x201C;Hey Dude, come be on my radio show with me.  You&#x2019;ll have fun.&#x201D;  Little did I know that for several years I would be hosting multiple radios shows.  I had a heavy metal with my best friend show.  I did an indy rock show with my buddies.  We had 90s rock, which will forever be my favorite genre.  The room was filled with compact discs and we had to literally pick out the music CD by CD and put it in the player.  That&#x2019;s right millenials, take off your furry costumes long enough to hear this through your earholes-  Back in my day we didn&#x2019;t have streaming music services.  We had CDs, and they got scratched, and it was aggro-vating as hell as you jogged because the laser would skip and your song would eff up.  ^%&amp;%<em>&amp;^%</em>&amp;^&amp;^%$^#%^$^$</p>
<p>There was a sign hanging in the studio.  &#x201C;Please don&#x2019;t have more than four guests in the studio at once,&#x201D; but some hillarious asshat changed the sign to read &#x201C;Please don&#x2019;t shave more than four guests in the studio at once.&#x201D;  Cute, but it&#x2019;s stuck with me.</p>
<p>Anyways,  that was then.  Since then I&#x2019;ve been married 20 years (nearly divorced at least thrice), finished grad school, had several kids, had an industry career, a professing career, and had another industry career.  I&#x2019;ve been blown up, fired, in the hospital a few times, my mothe, many of my uncles and aunts, and all my grandparents have died, and honestly I&#x2019;ve had a bit of a bizarre life.  Much of it has been amazing, and much of it has been depressing and anxiety inducing.  Somewhere in 2012 I realized the hard truth that Jet Fuel can&#x2019;t melt steel beams, and the resulting discoveries about how our world works and the pedophiles in charge has been agonizing.  Turns out drinking isn&#x2019;t that great of a solution to any of this.</p>
<p>So, these days, I put my war paint on, try to get up, and go to work. I try to keep a positive attitude, but so much of it seems a strain.  The world is changing agonizingly slowly and it isn&#x2019;t clear that it&#x2019;s all for the better.  Work is getting better, but it&#x2019;s a challenge to stay connected to the fiat world when all I want to do is leave it.  I know that every single time I use a dollar it empowers people that cause harm.  Like all marriages we have our ups and downs, but I have a way of making the downs downer.  My body which used to be ripped is now overweight and my physical ass kicking days are over. My kids are amazing little people and I&#x2019;m grateful, but sometimes their energy is overwhelming when other parts of life are blargh.</p>
<p>Such is life.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, it&#x2019;s with that open discussion that I can deliver the actual point of this.  Last night for just a few hours I was transformed back to that 18 year old kid.  I was playing 90s rock from the convenience of my office.  I was wracking my brain trying to remember all the songs I love.  I was there like John Cusack in High Fidelity poking away at Spotify and Twitch trying to make the music play that brings a special love and joy.  At various points all members of my family were caught live on air.  Baby 2 was perhaps the cutest when she stole my headphones listened to the music and squeeeeelllleeed in delight, but she didn&#x2019;t know the mic was hot.</p>
<p>I played love songs, dance songs, rock songs, sexy songs, and personal favorites.  I took requests, and I played what I wanted when I wanted it.  I interjected smooth DJ lines like &#x201C;You&#x2019;re on the air with MSP WAVES&#x201D; I even brought back my old DJ name Skanky J.  We discussed banksters, trolls, fiat, love, music, posting, and I thanked our supporters @lovejuice and @rhondak for her latest project Steemshelves.com, which I&#x2019;ll post about later tonight.  I haven&#x2019;t brought back naked radio&#x2026; but it&#x2019;s on the list.</p>
<p>Not only was it one of the best nights I&#x2019;ve had on PALnet, the Discord home of the Minnow Support Project, not only was it one of the best nights I&#x2019;ve had interacting with Steemians, it was honestly one of the best nights I&#x2019;ve had in 20 years.  I didn&#x2019;t know how much I missed muh music and muh show.  </p>
<p>So, Cork, or @sircork, this whole thing is a bit of bromance letter.  Thank you for the time machine, thank you for the media server to create MSP Waves, thank you for patiently helping me setup OBS to broadcast, thank you for setting up a website, thank you for onboarding and wrangling a dozen lowtech minnows to get this going, and thanks for being awesome.  You&#x2019;re a wonderful person, extremely generous, and I&#x2019;m blessed to count you as a friend.</p>

<p>When people first start on the platform they almost always start the same way.  &#x201C;Follow for follow?&#x201D;  &#x201C;Upvote for upvote?&#x201D;  Soon after they realize that it didn&#x2019;t get them very far.  Then they try spending hours a few hours on their perfect post&#x2026; it flops.  Then they get frustrated.  Then they think Steemit is a scam.  Sometimes they even go after people personally that are making good money on posts.</p>
<p>&#x201C;How dare you earn, when my post went unnoticed?!?  I deserve to be paid.  How dare the whales skip my post and award that other post?!? It isn&#x2019;t even talking about what I deem to be good, important, or well-written.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sometimes they start confronting the whales.  &#x201C;You circle jerking asshole, how dare you upvote that shit content!&#x201D;  Sometimes it&#x2019;s true.  Most of the time it&#x2019;s just a whale voting for someone they&#x2019;ve interacted with positively before and supporting their content.  Yeah, so, they go a little insane.  Then they catch a flag.</p>

They can&#x2019;t hold themselves responsible for their actions.  They are used to causing harm and harassing people all day without consequence.  When they get to steemit and find out for the first time that there are consequences for their actions and they are held responsible it&#x2019;s like they snap.  They can&#x2019;t take it.  </p>
<p>So, now it&#x2019;s flag war time, but these fuckin&#x2019; morons don&#x2019;t understand stake weighted down votes.</p>

They go on posts, they go into comments, maybe they build bot armies.  They say horrible shit about you.  They start tracking down friends and family.  They post all of that shit online thinking they are some empowered crusader on a holy war of biblical proportions because you held them accountable with a flag.</p>
<h2 id="Ok-so-now-you-have-to-escalate-cause-these-fuckers-are-everywhere"><a href="#Ok-so-now-you-have-to-escalate-cause-these-fuckers-are-everywhere" class="headerlink" title="Ok, so now you have to escalate cause these fuckers are everywhere "></a>Ok, so now you have to escalate cause these fuckers are everywhere </h2><h2></h2><p>What else are you gonna do?  You&#x2019;re mad.  They broke the rules.  You were within your rights to flag, and now they go even further out.  Worse yet, the flags didn&#x2019;t go down as you thought they would.  Instead of outright nuking the little fuck now they found a whale that supported them.  All the post rewards you took and all the ways you shattered their rep just bounced back and got more monies.  So, not only did you not silence the critic, not only did you not take away all their rewards, but now you have a pyschopath with a whale backer that didn&#x2019;t exist before.  So, while you&#x2019;re trying to escalate and nuke the moron that&#x2019;s clearly in the wrong.  You&#x2019;re burning SP and wasting rewards on some little shit who keep getting saved.</p>
<h2 id="First-off-the-answer-is-deescalate"><a href="#First-off-the-answer-is-deescalate" class="headerlink" title="First off the answer is deescalate "></a>First off the answer is deescalate </h2><h2></h2><p>I found this out in my very first flag war.  I dropped some nukes and a very clear psychopath ending up getting whale support and none of it went as planned.  So, I realized even while clearly in the right that it didn&#x2019;t have the effect or consequence I was looking for.  So, now while I still support flagging in the sense of self defense going balls out nuking isn&#x2019;t so much of a great plan.  You gotta find a way to deescalate shit.</p>
<h2 id="Stopping-others-from-upvoting-Satan"><a href="#Stopping-others-from-upvoting-Satan" class="headerlink" title="Stopping others from upvoting Satan "></a>Stopping others from upvoting Satan </h2><h2></h2><p>Let&#x2019;s say there is a massive troll that&#x2019;s up to no good.  We&#x2019;ll call them not2good.  And let&#x2019;s say they are supported by a powerful whale with millions of SP or for god&#x2019;s sake what if even one of the founders was supporting a well known troll.  What do you do?</p>
<p>I think the trick is to undermine the whale support.  Going all out on attack isn&#x2019;t going to have intended consequences.  Getting the whale or possibly the founder if that&#x2019;s necessary to realize they are supporting people calling for violence, rape, trolling behavior, the death of family members, etc seems critical.  Doxxing isn&#x2019;t ok.  Calling for harm is bad.  Literally just going deep into personal insults or involving family is way over the line.  </p>
<p><strong>Cause once the troll is isolated you&#x2019;re in a better stronger place, but when you nuke this platform seems to have a way to support the troll.</strong></p>
<p>So, moral of the story from what I can figure out is when hit with a troll you can flag them, but it&#x2019;s probably best not to nuke them, because it calls in support of other people who think even troll rapists flaming every post with drivel have a right to speak.  Violence in self defense seems aok, but when you switch to offense this place will rally for the wrong team.  If you go too far, it&#x2019;s best to deescalate yourself and get the whale support to back off.  </p>
<h2 id="But-please-check-yourself"><a href="#But-please-check-yourself" class="headerlink" title="But please check yourself.  "></a>But please check yourself.  </h2><h2></h2><p>If you find a well known troll on the platform please don&#x2019;t upvote them, don&#x2019;t support their posts, and don&#x2019;t encourage them.  And if you&#x2019;re a massive whale or you&#x2019;re like a founder with a ton of sway please don&#x2019;t spend a ton of your SP on saving horrible people on this platform.</p>

<p>The Minnow Support Project is exceptionally awesome.  We&#x2019;ve had intense growth, a ton of projects, and I&#x2019;m literally listening to msp-waves radio right now.  WE HAVE OUR OWN RADIO STATION!!!  That&#x2019;s amazing!</p>

The Discord Channel is called Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  We don&#x2019;t have a lot of rules.  Keep General pretty cool.  No porn.  Don&#x2019;t flame or doxx people.  Pretty simple </p>
<h2 id="Some-people-just-want-to-watch-the-world-burn"><a href="#Some-people-just-want-to-watch-the-world-burn" class="headerlink" title="Some people just want to watch the world burn "></a>Some people just want to watch the world burn </h2><h2></h2><p>You know with 4000 people we haven&#x2019;t really seen that many trolls.  I can count them on one hand still.  One is now pretty good active community members.  I get some people that tell me PALnet is the best internet community they&#x2019;ve been on.  I have others that say they dealt with trolls in their community every day.  We&#x2019;ve been extremely fortunate to be this big and have this few trolls.  So, what do you do when you have someone that basically just wants to pick a fight?  My suggestion is to de-escalate the situation.</p>
<p>In all things, from moderating the channel, to working on steemit, to business, to family, and marriage, I tend to think the answer is to de-escalate.  It&#x2019;s a commitment to it really.  In all things deescalate.  Usually it involves a customer service voice.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for registering your complaint.  I&#x2019;m sorry you experienced that.  yes, I hear your concern.  That&#x2019;s very sad and thank you for sharing.  By the way, we have community standards around here.  Everyone in the community is welcome here, but they have to abide by some very low guidelines.  Can you agree to abide by these?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#x2019;s it.  Then dead silence.  I&#x2019;ve even been known to remove posts that &#x201C;break the ice&#x201D; because I want the ice.  Anything that represents a potential acknowledgement is usually enough to get going again and get life back on track.  I&#x2019;ve tried escalation in another approach, and almost immediately regretted it.  I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s the way to go.  Peace and de-escalation.  Those are the options that I think work in this platform and in life in general.</p>
<p>If people aren&#x2019;t able to agree to general terms and state that publicly then it&#x2019;s pretty easy to ask them to leave at that point.  they&#x2019;ve admitted they won&#x2019;t follow the rules, which are very low bar, so it&#x2019;s on them to realize that&#x2019;s why they aren&#x2019;t welcome.  So, far it seems to be working.  </p>

Whenever given the choice between escalating a conflict and de-escalating a conflict do everything in your power to de-escalate while holding your ground.</p>

<p>This is a quick PSA to let folks know that starting a week from this Sunday I&#x2019;m going to be hosting a radio show in the PALnet Discord Chatroom on Sunday evenings from 8pm-10pm NYC time.  It&#x2019;s called Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  It&#x2019;s just meant to be a Q&amp;A session with some funny anecdotes tossed in there. </p>
<h2 id="Why-we-started-this"><a href="#Why-we-started-this" class="headerlink" title="Why we started this "></a>Why we started this </h2><h2></h2><p>There are tons of people with lots of good ideas, but it&#x2019;s hard to get them out there.  You need to interact with folks and form community in order to get things accomplished.  The radio station is aimed at pulling people together and getting to work.  Some of this is just to foster a sense of community, some is to share news, and some to make friends.  I continue wanting to support the values of peace, abundance, and liberty.  This seems like a way to make connections, spread Steemit, and get the word out.</p>

<p>Well, the little fund raiser I planned for a single mom to help her out turned into a generosity fest of around 900SBDs.  I know some more are coming too.  Every now and then this community makes me weep, and this is one them.  I think @clevercreator is in a better spot today than yesterday.  You guys are awesome!</p>
<p>Honestly, it started when I saw the donation that @ausbitbank made.  That guy has been through hell with his family. He has two non verbal autistic kids and he&#x2019;s publicly stated it&#x2019;s cost him over $300,000 on therapy so far.  He and his wife have sacrificed so much to give their kids some quality of life.  I&#x2019;ll stay up late chatting with him over Discord and he&#x2019;ll personally share various bits of hardship that his family goes through financially, emotionally, and medically.  I know his house needs repair, and I know he&#x2019;s living a modest lifestyle.  So, when that dude breaks out a 200 SBD donation to help a stranger on another continent&#x2026; I have no words.  I&#x2019;m just grateful to find people like that at all let alone be literally surrounded by people like that on here.  Aus, you&#x2019;re my brother.  Thanks for doing this journey with me.</p>
<p>@benjojo thought he might have escaped from this too, but nope.  Here&#x2019;s another example of maximum philanthropy.  Dude let&#x2019;s @minnowsupport sit on a 90k SP delegation for months.  He asks nothing in return.  Not even a fucking resteem or something.  He&#x2019;s just happy to see minnows growing because of it.  So, without a stake he&#x2019;s still able to grow his account because people like him and he&#x2019;s a great author and has creative works coming out.  So, what&#x2019;s he do.  He donates.  He tosses out 60 SBD to the single mom that needs help like he&#x2019;s just getting breakfast.  It&#x2019;s incredible to me to see how he just operates on the condition of generosity and I hope to emulate it if I&#x2019;m able to grow pure huge on here.</p>
<p>@steemitqa deserves a special mention too.  He&#x2019;s not a rich guy.   I know that.  But he&#x2019;s in there with a 50 SBD donation too.  Steemitqa has the honor of being the funniest Steemian I know.  He hangs out in Steemspeak all the time and is the only guy out there dropping more and funnnier wisecracks than me.  He&#x2019;s hilarious, a blast, and a very kind soul.  If you&#x2019;re interested in ZAPPL and making Steemit more like some of the other social media platforms he&#x2019;s your man.  I think they&#x2019;re fund raising now too.</p>
<p>I couldn&#x2019;t forget the minnows either.  Both people in general, but more specifically the Minnow Support Project.  You can check the logs and see that lots of people are giving what they can in 2 SBD to 10 SBD batches.  If you cross reference that with folks in the PALnet Discord channel you&#x2019;ll see some very familiar faces.  These are people working day and night trying to make it on Steemit who put hours into posts that get a dozen views and a few bucks.  They&#x2019;re also in there donating what they can.</p>
<p>@isaria, @gmuxx, @abh12345, @ilyastarar, @gmuxx, @calamus056, @morodiene, @drpuffnstuff, @neoxian, @dogeking, @drakos.  I hope it&#x2019;s not your turn for something like this, but you can bet your ass I&#x2019;ll be there for you too when it is.</p>
<p>I saw a bunch of people not only send donations, but also topped off some of her active posts.  @ausbitbank did that, @canadian-coconut did that, @calamus056 did that.  I need to think up a generosity medal&#x2026;</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#x2019;m sorry to be a weepy sap on here a bunch, but when I&#x2019;m not thrashing about the immoral banksters that cause violence and run the world I&#x2019;m just a dude that wants to sit back, make jokes, and laugh in peace and abundance with my friends.  They&#x2019;re easy to find on this platform, and I&#x2019;m grateful to be here and grateful to this community.</p>
<p>Many blessings of peace, abundance, and liberty to you and yours and I stand in awe of your generosity.</p>
