<p>Lovejuice started as a weird joke to me.  I was mad at how much circle jerking was going on and I was going to build a bot that would flag posts and spray some lovejuice on it and tell people that lovejuice is best shared between at least two consenting adults.  That didn&#x2019;t happen and so I had this account lying around.  After HF19 bid bots came out and you could purchase super large votes, but finding the smaller less well used ones was hard.  So, I fired up a linux box, installed Dr. Otto by @inertia, and turned lovejuice into a bid bot.  She/he/it/furryx has been running on 5k, then 10k, then 15k SP.  It&#x2019;s putting around 20USD on a post when it&#x2019;s fully bought (going up with the newest spike).</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s pulling in about 6-10/day SBD right now, and that&#x2019;s a fair amount of money.  I don&#x2019;t just want to take from the community I want to give back (one way you can see that is through my delegations).  So, somewhere along the way I decided to post some weird erotic stories on there to go with the erotic theme of the name lovejuice.  I&#x2019;m not much of a sexy time writer so I started asking a few people to write some content on there and I would pay them for that.  It started at 5sbd, but then that went crazy, so we switched to 5usd, and then 5 steem.  Now, I&#x2019;m pretty happy to pay 20USD worth of steem or sbd for a story.</p>
<h2 id="The-content"><a href="#The-content" class="headerlink" title="The content "></a>The content </h2><h2></h2><p>Lovejuice started with erotic content, but meh, I&#x2019;m happy to accept just about anything.  This is geared towards helping minnows who are just starting with no steem and no followers to try to build some equity on the platform.  So, I care a little less about the content and more about supporting new users on here.  So, don&#x2019;t shitpost, but write about whatever you want, do art, make stories, showcase talents, and make this kinda like a variety mag.</p>
<h2 id="Logistics"><a href="#Logistics" class="headerlink" title="Logistics "></a>Logistics </h2><h2></h2><p>@isaria runs the day to day.  So, find her in the PALnet discord channel and message her (you can find the link on the @minnowsupport wall).  Give her the text and a link to an image and if it&#x2019;s accepted she&#x2019;ll post it on Lovejuice and when payout happens we&#x2019;ll send you 20USD worth of Steem.  For now we&#x2019;re looking for roughly 1 a day.  We&#x2019;ll see how reception to this goes.</p>
<h2 id="Marketing-your-posts"><a href="#Marketing-your-posts" class="headerlink" title="Marketing your posts "></a>Marketing your posts </h2><h2></h2><p>So, I&#x2019;m gonna market the posts that you make on there too.  How will I do that you ask?  Bid Bots!  As coowner of steembottracker.com and helping to manage a series of bots on Steem I am a believer in these as a tool to help promote people and as a potential revenue model.  So, how does it work.  You send us the original text of a new post (typically delivered on a hackmd.io markdown page), we post it, and I&#x2019;ll nuke it with some bid bot rewards to try to get some eyes on it.</p>
<p>The author gets exposure, I have a sustainable revenue model, shit posters have more competition, and we have a sustainable economic model to promote minnow content with heavy votes that hopefully break even  and maybe catch a few extra votes or would be pre-runner curators.  Hopefully getting put on the page will get you more followers and friends as you&#x2019;ll get an immediate viewership of 1400 from @lovejuice and then here&#x2019;s hoping the bid bots collect more eyes too.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s meant to be fun and helpful to new members in the community.  Hopefully this all goes well.</p>

<p>With 7 days to Christmas I want to do a Scavenger hunt to help minnows on the platform out.  Mom always told me to leave the world better than I found it and here&#x2019;s a way I can try to live up to that.  I&#x2019;m a little nervous with the price of things going haywire right now, but oh well.  It&#x2019;s Christmas.  Time to help minnows for the holidays, here&#x2019;s hoping you&#x2019;ll have a little more in your stocking this year.  </p>
<p>I&#x2019;m the very proud founder of the Minnow Support Project, which is the largest off chain Discord community for Steemians.  We have a simple charter.  Promote the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  Help Steem grow.  Train and retain new members on the platform.  We have a couple programs that can help new people get started.  Now, because there&#x2019;s a pump and a lot of new people are going to join us I thought I&#x2019;d go the extra step and pay you personally to get acquainted with some stuff you should be likely be doing anyway.  We have so many examples of success it&#x2019;s silly.  Basically you should be working with the Minnow Support Project as a new user, building a community around you by making friends in the PALnet Discord server, and I&#x2019;d go so far as to say if you&#x2019;re not doing this you&#x2019;re Steeming wrong.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m going to give out 10 Steem per person that completes my Scavenger hunt.  I&#x2019;ll limit it to 60 people for now.  This may cost me a small fortune, but so be it.  If it goes haywire I may complete my first power down ever to pay, but we&#x2019;ll see how this baby goes.  Anyway, it&#x2019;s a bunch of steps, but these steps will help you grow and I&#x2019;ll send you something like 30USD (give or take 10? 20?) for having done it&#x2026; so, there&#x2019;s that too.</p>
<h2 id="The-Spirit-of-Steem-Christmas"><a href="#The-Spirit-of-Steem-Christmas" class="headerlink" title="The Spirit of Steem Christmas "></a>The Spirit of Steem Christmas </h2><h2></h2><p>I believe in the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  We&#x2019;re going to use some random acts of kindness to help others and make them feel valued.  We&#x2019;re also going to practice some good behaviors.  And as a reward everyone that participates is getting 10 Steem.  You must be a minnow (5,000SP or less) or member of the Minnow Support Project to participate, and it&#x2019;s ok to become a member just to participate.</p>
<h2 id="Rules"><a href="#Rules" class="headerlink" title="Rules "></a>Rules </h2><h2></h2><p>Step 1.  Resteem this post (I&#x2019;ll resteem your entry later, but I&#x2019;ll do it to 8500 people on @aggroed or 7k on @minnowsupport so I&#x2019;ll pay you back for this!)</p>
<p>Step 2.  Create a post on mspsteem.com (this is a clone of steemit.com, but it has a 5% beneficiary to @minnowsupport and it&#x2019;s run by @netuoso) and put the following stuff in it:</p>
<p>Start by finding a good Christmas/Holiday pic from pixabay.com and linking that image.  If you wanna do something non-Christmas or some other holiday ok&#x2026; get a yule log&#x2026; </p>
<ul>
<li>Find 3 minnows (people with under 5k Steem Power) and post a thoughtful comment on different posts.  I&#x2019;ll accept a meme or a gif with a friendly comment with it.  Take snapshots and include those in your mspsteem post.  Hopefully you&#x2019;ll gain some followers for this.</li>
<li>Comment on 3 posts by dolphins or whales.  Take snapshots and put those in the post.  Hopefully you&#x2019;ll catch some nice votes for this.</li>
<li>Join the Minnow Support Project Discord Server called PALnet by clicking this: <a href="https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy</a>.  Take a snapshot of you typing in there.  Hopefully you&#x2019;ll build a community around you by doing this.</li>
<li>Get registered in there and use the $upvote URL command to get a small vote from the account @minnowsupport.  Enjoy the vote as a free gift, and take a snapshot to show it happened! </li>
<li>Compliment someone in PALnet (take a snapshot).  Hopefully you make a friend.</li>
<li>Listen to a mspwaves radio show and take a snapshot of yourself in the audience in Discord.  You can check out the schedule at mspwaves.com.  Post that image.  Hopefully you find some entertainment here and learn something about other Steemians.</li>
<li>Go to steemit.com/~witnesses and vote for any witness.  Hopefully you pick some from the Minnow Support Project, but they all count.  Take a snapshot of a witness vote you made and include it in the post.</li>
<li>Share your gratefuls.  Tell us three people and 3 things you&#x2019;re grateful for this end of year.</li>
<li>Share your hopefuls.  Tell us what you&#x2019;re looking forward to in 2018.</li>
<li>Share your freedoms.  Tell us what you&#x2019;re not going to carry into 2018.</li>
<li><p>Share a story of how the Minnow Support Project or someone in it helped you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optional: delegate any amount of Steem Power to @minnowsupport (doing so will earn you automatic upvote from @msp-lovebot) -  <a href="https://mspdelegator.herokuapp.com/mspdelegator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://mspdelegator.herokuapp.com/mspdelegator</a>.  Folks that delegate even just a handful of Steem Power are likely to catch larger votes from @minnowsupport.  Also, don&#x2019;t delegate unless you will still have more than 50Sp left on your account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 3.  Publish your post (has to be on mspsteem) and link the post URL into the comments in here.  Use the tag Santagroed.</p>
<p>Step 4.  Aggroed and/or @minnowsupport will resteem it and you get some more followers.</p>
<p>Step 5.  Aggroed will send you 10 steem.</p>
<p>Step 6.  Extra good posts will receive large Christmas votes from @minnowsupport.</p>

<p>@theywillkillyou BOOYA 1M subscribers, @davidpakman KAPOW 400k subscriber, @brianturner BOOM 200k subscribers.  On top of that we had a fantastic audience and rounded out the show with our very own homegrown stars from PALnet, the Minnow Support Project, and even some visitors from neighboring groups!</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m really excited to bring you this show because we&#x2019;re trying to talk through what it&#x2019;s going to take for us as a community to be able to bring YouTube content providers here and start getting a glance of what is needed on and off the block to make this transition happen.</p>
<p>We also have a tentative date set right now for January 13th for a 5M YouTube subscriber panel discussion.  The plan is to get YouTube Personalities and Steem folks together to build a community of YouTubers on the block to help ease the transition by having a community to work with.  I&#x2019;m excited to see where we can take this!</p>

<p>Giant show tonight.  We have some big people and big plans to discuss!  Over 1.6M Youtubers will be represented on the show primarily by three key people.</p>
<p>@davidpakman from the David Pakman Show is going to bring a left wing political audience of 400k from YouTube.<br>@theywillkillyou via Angelo has 1M YouTube audience.<br>@brianturner with a 200k YouTube audience will be there too.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s 1,600,000 people represented and hopefully made more aware of Steem and how this blockchain community can help them.</p>

The goal is to bring people that have 5M Youtube subscribers on the show and have them talk about their experience and what it might mean for them on Steem and with Steem.  This is framed by the ongoing adpocolapsye  where YouTube is demonitizing content and basically financially censoring people who have opinions they or their corporate sponsors don&#x2019;t like.</p>
<p>I know a Blockchain that could help, and I know a distributed YouTube service that might come in handy!</p>
<h2 id="Show-Logistics"><a href="#Show-Logistics" class="headerlink" title="Show Logistics "></a>Show Logistics </h2><h2></h2><p>The show is on tonight from 8pm-11pm (we often run over).  Show starts at 0100 UTC.  The format is a Town Hall style where folks from the audience are welcome to come on air.  This one is a little different because we have 3 invited guests.  So, when they are around I&#x2019;ll be sure to give them preference for on air time, but in between the invited guests the general public is welcome to come on air and hangout with me. Standard rules apply, you can voice concerns or complaints, you can promote yourself, others, or projects, and you can perform some too if you&#x2019;d like, but just make sure that you&#x2019;re not doing personal attacks.  PALnet and MSP are do no harm, but take no shit land.  Short leashes for anyone that wants to attack others or Steemit (complaints and concerns are ok, but characters attacks get people muted, kicked, and banned).</p>

<p>You will need a working mic and a headset if you want to participate on air. </p>
<h2 id="Funky-Aside"><a href="#Funky-Aside" class="headerlink" title="Funky Aside "></a>Funky Aside </h2><h2></h2><p>Still working on putting together an all inclusive Crypto Forum.  @haejin is building up quite a name and following as a crypto trader.  Seems like he&#x2019;s willing to come on air not this Sunday, but on Christmas Eve.  Should be fun, but only if you&#x2019;re interested in making gobs of money from his trading tips and advice.</p>
<h2 id="News-Alert"><a href="#News-Alert" class="headerlink" title="News Alert "></a>News Alert </h2><h2></h2><p>BTC hits 20k.  More money to be plowed into crypto.  Good times!</p>
<h2 id="Delegation"><a href="#Delegation" class="headerlink" title="Delegation "></a>Delegation </h2><h2></h2><p>Delegation will happen tonight as per normal, but I&#x2019;m putting out a notice.  I&#x2019;m likely going to shift how I&#x2019;ve been doing delegation.  I&#x2019;m going to start another msp account dedicated to the audience and I&#x2019;m going to shift from a delegation model to individuals to a community pot that all the DJs can use to add their active listeners onto the autovoter.  For now it stays the same&#x2026; but it may be changing.</p>
<h2 id="Dice-Bitches"><a href="#Dice-Bitches" class="headerlink" title="Dice Bitches "></a>Dice Bitches </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;ll be giving away 50 steem on air.  We do this through dice.  Roll dice with the <code>t!dice 10d10</code> command, and then I&#x2019;ll shrink it to 9d9 and so on.  If you beat or tie my roll you can move onto the next round.  If you win you get the money.  If I win it goes to msp-waves.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/10/13/16/01/bees-486872_960_720.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So, I have to say it&#x2026; Jerry is onto something with the Worker Proposal system.  I think it&#x2019;s proven to be pretty effective in a number of cases and coins to decentralize the work necessary to grow various blockchains and their networks.  I think Steem could benefit from having one. </p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re unfamiliar with a worker proposal system it&#x2019;s essentially a fund that is segregated by the block.  People can submit projects to the fund and be paid for working on behalf of the Steemit community.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m not an expert on worker proposal systems themselves so I don&#x2019;t want to dive into exactly how the worker proposal side of things should work, but @timcliff and I have been poking around in the block this week and we think we have a way to pay for this.  Personally, I want to simultaneously unwind one of my least favorite aspects of the Steem blockchain as it stands today, distribution, while enabling a block empowering worker system that should lift up the whole platform.</p>
<p>As we say in New England &#x201C;a rising tide lifts all ships.&#x201D;  We&#x2019;re at $2, and if we did nothing except for hang in in for the ride that btc is on we&#x2019;d be at $6.  This platform is amazing and undervalued, and I think we have to do a little more to get investor attention.  I think this could be it.</p>
<h2 id="Distribution-now"><a href="#Distribution-now" class="headerlink" title="Distribution now "></a>Distribution now </h2><h2></h2><p>93% of the Steem sits in less than 1% of the accounts.  That&#x2019;s not good for us.  In fact I think it hurts us and our credibility as a network substantially.  Three things contributed to this more than anything else.  Initial distribution of Steem.  Mining of Steem.  Stake weighted inflation of Steem.</p>
<p>Not only did some accounts get early access to large amounts of steem, followed by some of the earliest accounts having access to mining which has added up to at least 10 Million Steem to a handful of accounts, but then arguably worse than all of that we had Stake Weighted Inflation set at a ridiculous percent.  So, all that early access Steem grew at least 2X and possibly larger simply because we had an absurd inflation on the platform.  Instead of it being dolled out in post rewards to active users it went to the people who ALREADY had the most Steem on the platform.  Essentially the Steem holders grew their stake by a massive margin and it drove the price down to seven cents.  </p>
<h2 id="We-can-do-better"><a href="#We-can-do-better" class="headerlink" title="We can do better "></a>We can do better </h2><h2></h2><p>We have an incredible network.  We often have the most transactions out of any block.  We hold the record for most transactions.  We are the fastest block going.  We have free transactions.  We have 30k active daily users and growing.  We have a ton going for us, but we&#x2019;re undervalued relative to other chains and their block activity by about 100X maybe even 1000X (check out <a href="http://blocktivity.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://blocktivity.info/</a>  for where I&#x2019;m pulling that number out of).  I think we&#x2019;re still crawling our way out of stake weighted inflation shoving the price down to seven cents.</p>
<p>Stake weighted inflation was toned way down, but it still exists. It&#x2019;s hard coded into the block that 15% of the newly minted Steem that hits the platform from inflation goes to stake holders.  As of yesterday you can see that the effective stake weighted inflation rate is at 7% of all the steem rewards that come through platform inflation.  This number changes due to a number of factors, but it fights to get to 15%. </p>

<h2 id="How-much-is-that"><a href="#How-much-is-that" class="headerlink" title="How much is that? "></a>How much is that? </h2><h2></h2><p>For ease of Math the platform has 260M tokens outstanding.  It has a 10% inflation.  26M tokens will be produced in the next 12 months.  Of those tokens 7-15% of them will go to the less than 1% of all accounts that have the most stake already.  This is roughly 1.8M Steem on the low end 4.5M Steem on the high end.  This is worth $4-9M USD over the next 12 months (without any additional changes to the price of Steem).</p>
<h2 id="Which-sounds-more-likely-to-skyrocket-Steem"><a href="#Which-sounds-more-likely-to-skyrocket-Steem" class="headerlink" title="Which sounds more likely to skyrocket Steem? "></a>Which sounds more likely to skyrocket Steem? </h2><h2></h2><p>Whales have roughly 6M more Steem.<br>Steem as a community has a strong worker proposal system funded with 6M +/- 3M USD enabling thousands of projects to get off the ground.</p>
<p>Yes, whales will get slightly less Steem, but I think the value of every individual Steem they already have will be worth loads more.</p>
<h2 id="I&#x2019;m-pro-investor"><a href="#I&#x2019;m-pro-investor" class="headerlink" title="I&#x2019;m pro-investor "></a>I&#x2019;m pro-investor </h2><h2></h2><p>Please don&#x2019;t take this the wrong way.  I&#x2019;m not anti-whale.  I think our investors should be rewarded heavily.  I want investors to be rewarded on the platform.  I&#x2019;m glad they earn a healthy amount by posting, curating, delegating, and bidboting without the extra lovekick through stake weighted inflation to merit an investment here.  </p>
<p>I also think if there&#x2019;s a vibrant community working specifically on the Steem blockchain and all its possible needs we&#x2019;ll rise up much faster than what we&#x2019;re currently doing.  In short I think this will provide a better investment opportunity to investors who are looking to maximize Steem value.</p>
<h2 id="tl-dr"><a href="#tl-dr" class="headerlink" title="tl:dr "></a>tl:dr </h2><h2></h2><p>Rather than grant steem on stake weighted inflation lets send it into a worker proposal system.  </p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re a whale please ask yourself which is going to earn you more money.  Even more Steem sitting in the largest accounts or a worker system designed to improve projects in a decentralized way, to spread the gospel of the blockchain, make product improvements, help bring in investors, build applications, and a ton of small projects that people do with $3-7.5M meant to grow this platform.</p>
<p>Should be fun and I hope many of the whales on the platform vocally support a plan like this.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
