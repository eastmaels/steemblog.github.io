<p>Congratulations to @h0bby1.  In addition to your post earning $150 You&#x2019;re also getting an additional 50 SBD from me!!!  (You didn&#x2019;t put the post in the comments, so I missed the resteem window otherwise I would have done that too!)</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s the winning post on the basics of Linux!</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/linux/@h0bby1/basics-of-linux-operating-system-101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/linux/@h0bby1/basics-of-linux-operating-system-101</a></p>
<h2 id="Time-to-archive"><a href="#Time-to-archive" class="headerlink" title="Time to archive "></a>Time to archive </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m going to send this link off to steemshelves through @rhondak and you&#x2019;re officially in the MSPL!!!</p>
<h2 id="Next-Contest-HTML"><a href="#Next-Contest-HTML" class="headerlink" title="Next Contest: HTML "></a>Next Contest: HTML </h2><h2></h2><p>Let&#x2019;s keep this baby rolling!  We&#x2019;re trying to help people become developers and provide some posts that will encourage them.  Before we get to actually coding on the block chain let&#x2019;s get some basic programming stuff in the library.  I&#x2019;m running a contest to write about coding so we can build a library about it (everything gets archived at steemshelves.com).  The best post will get 50 SBD from me, archived in the library, resteemed, and probably some fat post rewards on it&#x2019;s own.</p>
<p>What we&#x2019;re looking for here is for you to make a post that covers some of the basics of writing in HTML.  It&#x2019;s eventually meant to help people build and design applications for the Steemit blockchain, so while you&#x2019;re writing please keep that in mind.</p>
<p>You can use @h0bby1&#x2019;s guide as a starting point.  I&#x2019;d ask that you consider adding a video as well.  But just walk us through HTML.</p>
<p>If you write a post, tag it with MSPL, and link it in the comments in here.  I&#x2019;ll resteem it, so even if you don&#x2019;t win the contest you&#x2019;ll get some sweet exposure (and I have some good whales who would be happy to support someone on a topic like this that follow me).</p>
<p>So, HMTL basics, write like you&#x2019;re talking to a total noob (more advanced stuff later), tell us where HTML is a good fit, and walk us through the some of the starting commands, link the post you make in the comments below, and you have a good shot at sitting 50 SBD + post rewards richer.</p>
<h2 id="Good-Luck"><a href="#Good-Luck" class="headerlink" title="Good Luck! "></a>Good Luck! </h2><h2></h2><p>PS check my transfer history to see I paid him!</p>

<p>This may seem off topic at first, but have you read Snowcrash by Neil Stevenson?  It&#x2019;s a really fucking good book.  My only problem is that every time I try to read just a little bit of it I&#x2019;m sucked in for 6-8 hours until I&#x2019;m finished.  I come out pretending to slash invisible government people-hackers with katanas.</p>
<p>Anyway, in that book (which I of course highly recommend) is a really unique setting.  It&#x2019;s a raft that sales across the ocean.  In the middle of the raft is a nuclear powered submarine (loaded with a nuclear warhead) and attached to it are a million little life rafts.  Some are big boats.  Some are just tiny one person rigs, but The Raft is the conglomeration of all those boats together.</p>
<p>I think it&#x2019;s equal parts having gone to and taught at institutions heavily influenced by military cultures combined with nautical themes that I can get the idea of The Minnow Support Project as a ship we&#x2019;re all on together.  Somedays that feels like we&#x2019;re on a speed boat racing in America&#x2019;s cup.  Sometimes that feels like we&#x2019;re on an aircraft carrier slowly turning in the middle of the ocean.  Sometimes it feels like we&#x2019;re a million people latching our boats together in a giant raft so we don&#x2019;t float away from each other.  No matter which one of those I&#x2019;m feeling like it is it always feels like home.</p>
<h2 id="Peace-Abundance-and-Liberty-as-Verbs"><a href="#Peace-Abundance-and-Liberty-as-Verbs" class="headerlink" title="Peace, Abundance, and Liberty as Verbs "></a>Peace, Abundance, and Liberty as Verbs </h2><h2></h2><p>While to most people the words Peace, Abundance, and Liberty are values; in here they are also direction.  It&#x2019;s the wind that guides our tact.  It&#x2019;s a verb.  It&#x2019;s an action.  Peace isn&#x2019;t something static to achieve.  It&#x2019;s a moving target every day with a new set of criteria and a different way to think through things each time.  There are a new set of challenges every day and how to apply the value of peace, abundance, and/or Liberty is a daily question and puzzle.</p>
<p>The French existentialist Sartre wrote once about the Bible and the short comings he found in it.  I&#x2019;ll paraphrase him as saying &#x2018;Bibilical understanding of life is easy at the extremes.  It&#x2019;s simple to say do not kill or steal.  The challenge is that most of life is in the grey zone, and the simple commandments don&#x2019;t clearly state how to proceed.&#x201D;  I don&#x2019;t mean to down play the Bible for our religious friends, but I feel like steering a 5,000 Steemian ship, raft, minnowschool, flotilla, or whatever it may be isn&#x2019;t always clear.  I just do my best to act on simple guidelines and treat this place with the humor it needs and the seriousness it deserves.  It&#x2019;s not just my home.  It&#x2019;s all of our homes.  And I try to treat the members like I would family members who I love even when that&#x2019;s hard to do.  But what&#x2019;s the other option&#x2026; they&#x2019;re my family.</p>
<h2 id="Digistead"><a href="#Digistead" class="headerlink" title="Digistead "></a>Digistead </h2><h2></h2><p>So, along with that sentiment I&#x2019;ve been thinking of this place as my digital homestead.  For a while I was really considering wether to spend my time buying a greenhouse to practice aquaponics that I love dearly or stake my flag in the ground in Steemit.  So, I&#x2019;m cristening the term &#x201C;digistead.&#x201D;  It&#x2019;s the amalgamation of digital and homestead.  PALnet is mine (it&#x2019;s my home, but that&#x2019;s not to stop others from claiming it as their home.  Many of us belong there!).</p>
<p>As simple as it is this image has captivated me for a while.  </p>

<p>It has so many elements of clever from the historical nature to the internet culture.  I love it, but it also got me thinking.  </p>
<h2 id="I-do-give-a-fuck"><a href="#I-do-give-a-fuck" class="headerlink" title="I do give a fuck "></a>I do give a fuck </h2><h2></h2><p>I give many fucks.  And in this Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network I shall sow my seeds of fuck and harvest the fruits of my labor in the form of digital wealth and an international family.  So, have I staked this claim and put my body to the task.  There would be no home, no digistead without it.  I will tend this place for as long as it will fulfill the simple mission of P.A.L.  See my fuckfields and gasp slack-jawed at my harvest of freshly given fucks.</p>
<h2 id="Shane"><a href="#Shane" class="headerlink" title="Shane "></a>Shane </h2><h2></h2><p>So, with this backdrop I&#x2019;ll share that there are plenty of times that I second guess myself.  There are times that I&#x2019;m unclear of how to execute best on Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  There are times when the needs of the many are beyond the scope of my limited heart and brain.  I seek enlightened council.  I need strong people with caring hearts and a deeply shared passion for the mission to help guide me and make sure my eyesight is clear.</p>
<p>In this regard one of the first people I constantly turn to is @swelker101.  He cares deeply about this place.  He approaches things with a level and even tempered head.  He understands the long term vision of the Minnow Support Project and what this group of immensely talented people are capable of when we work together.  He is kind, funny, charming, and deeply committed.</p>
<p>It seemed at the time like a lucky find to have him join early, but to see him be a wonderful guide and fantastic leader I&#x2019;m shaking my head in wonderful disbelief.  He&#x2019;s a blessing to have in the group, and one I&#x2019;m deeply thankful for.  And I&#x2019;m blessed to have had him enter the group nearly at it&#x2019;s founding!</p>
<p>Shane; I love you like a brother, I trust you like a wise teacher, I&#x2019;m grateful like a warm smile, and I&#x2019;m your friend like two 10 year olds playing in the woods.  When I come home to PAL and see you in there another day I&#x2019;m filled with joy, gratitude, and relief.  It&#x2019;s another day I&#x2019;ll have my bud, wise council, and a steady/firm hand that knows the way.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s no fancy prize, no award, not much more than an attaboy, but I&#x2019;m immensely grateful you&#x2019;re here and it&#x2019;s a remarkable honor to serve this population beside you.</p>
<p>Thanks Shane.  I love you.  Pure bromo!</p>
<p>PS sorry to ruin the moment with a Witness vote thing, but please make sure you upvote his Witness.  Shane needs 100 votes and 10 PV before he can be a managing Witness with full elected and accountable authority in there.  The sooner we can get him there the better.  www.steemit.com/~witnesses</p>

<p>Man,  I love doing muh show.  Thanks to @sircork, @r0nd0n, @ma1neevent, @uniwhisp and @globocop for helping to make the station run.  Thanks @eturnerx for helping to keep the lights on through your thing that you do.</p>
<p>Told a couple stories.  There was a brief &#x201C;ask me anything&#x201D; where we talked about what makes for a good mod, and what makes for a good witness. We spoke a little bit, but not overbearingly long about how global finance is controlled by immoral banksters and how Peace, Abundance, and Liberty are the right response to that.</p>
<p>We listened to some 90s rock and a little bit of classic rock.  So, the toonage was solid.</p>
<p>We played some dice.  The first two round were inconclusive so as I did last week I sent the 25 sbd prize pool off to our newest mod.  in this case it&#x2019;s @travelnurse.  So, she was a recipient of 25 SBD.</p>
<p>We played a second dice game.  This time @diggerdugg kicked in 5sbd and I kicked in 15 sbd.  The action was fast and furious, but again no one could beat my dice roll.  So, we did a 1 time roll off.  And coming in hawt with a 98 out 100 @negativer walked away with 20 SBD.</p>
<p>Last but not least I ran a competition where people in the show had to go out and recruit for the show.  Every person who came in and said who brought them in became eligible for the 1000 SP delegation.  There were 17 entries of folks who joined the show because of recruitment, which helped get the show up to 30 Steemian listeners (still short of @crimsonclad ath of 40 listeners).  Here are the recruiters and recruitees-</p>
<p>Recruiter    Recruitee<br>choogirl    gohba<br>choogirl    scooter77<br>choogirl    shelly<br>mikepm74    ethandsmith<br>torico    dingo<br>morodiene    kitchen<br>mikepm74    ArbitraryKitten<br>morodiene    rougebot<br>mikepm74    shadowspub<br>mikepm74    topkpop<br>torico    dunstuff<br>choogirl    wholesomeroots<br>choogirl    lunatic<br>torico    krazykrista<br>morodiene    negativer<br>choogirl    ed<br>choogirl    diggerdugg</p>
<p>The winner by random chance was @mikepm74.  He had the option to split his delegation as he saw fit and decided to keep it all!!!  Boom.  So, I attempted to award him 1000 SP, but I effed up and gave it to a bot I was using as a practice URL for steem connect.  Whoops.  So I undelegated that, and then I sent him 500 delegated steem.  I&#x2019;ll send him another 500 in two days.  He can keep it until he&#x2019;s a dolphin or earns a total of 5,000 Steem.  After that I&#x2019;ll yoink it back and give to another deserving minnow.</p>
<p>I gotta tell ya.  I love being a witness.  I love running muh show.  I love delegating a shit ton of steem to a deserving minnow every week, and I love running PALnet and the MSP and seeing where we go.  Thanks for riding the waves with your host Skanky J.</p>

<p>OK, so, next up on the Meet your Mods series is Rhonda.  She&#x2019;s in the footehills in Appalachia.  She&#x2019;s tough as nails and spends her time in the Minnow Pond running the Fiction Workshop.  It&#x2019;s been hugely popular and helped numerous people win Curie Votes and is a part of the Minnow Support Project that helps uphold the educational mission of this place to improve the quality of content.  Maybe one day we&#x2019;ll get more variety in the trending pages, and when we finally do you can bet your ass some of the folks in there will have benefitted from some tough critiques from @rhondak.</p>
<p>Back in her physical world she&#x2019;s fighting corruption and animal abuse with her animal shelter project.  The liquid rewards of this post will help her kick some maleficent official ass and take care of some abused animals.</p>

<p>Word of caution.  The Fiction Workshop isn&#x2019;t  a place to fuck around. Don&#x2019;t post and run.  And don&#x2019;t act like a brat when they tear your word baby to shreds.  That&#x2019;s what they do and that&#x2019;s exactly how you get real help.  But there isn&#x2019;t hand holding in this group.  So, drop your shields and keep your chin up.  You can thank them later when it pays off and you&#x2019;re doing better.</p>
