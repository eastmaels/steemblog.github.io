<p>Working on putting together 1-2 min of animation for the Talia background story.  I&#x2019;m modifying the story I wrote into a animation script!  This may be longer than 2 min.  Let&#x2019;s see what they say.</p>
<p>Setting: a forest path.<br>Lyanna is 7 months pregnant and forced to flee her home with her 6 year old Talia and 8 year old Kiara. Talia looks human, and is wearing a tight white choker around her neck with a quartz emblem.<br>They are headed down the forest path in a fast carriage pulled by two silvershield warriors. Lyanna is pregnant and uncomfortable in the jostling carriage. Two serpentine soldiers and a cerebus which have been chasing them fade into the distance.</p>
<p>A very exhausted and uncomfortable Lyanna lifts the carriage latch and yells at Natalium: &#x201C;Stop! We&#x2019;re getting out!&#x201D;</p>
<p>The carriage halts and Natalium looks back with a worried expression: &#x201C;M&#x2019;Lady! Are you mad?!?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Lyanna says firmly as she steps out &#x201C;They&#x2019;re hunting a carriage, not a woman and children on foot. You can&#x2019;t be more than a day&#x2019;s ride from East Haven. Take the carriage and race to town.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Natalium: &#x201C;What will you do? If you are harmed, Aggroedius will have my head. Peace be damned.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Lyanna looks to the West and sees the ooze caves in the distance. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll head there.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mom, that seems insane, we know that oozethma lives in there. Those caves haven&#x2019;t been cleared since Dad lost his Mace of Abundance. He&#x2019;s said that over and over to people to warn them.&#x201D; Kiara says.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The girl is right,&#x201D; Natalium interjects but Lyanna waves him quiet. &#x201C;Talia and Kiara you&#x2019;re coming with me.&#x201D; She turns her attention to the carriage: &#x201D;Go,&#x201D; she insists, sending the carriage on its way.</p>
<p>Lyanna looks back behind them. &#x201C;Serpentine Soldiers, Cerberus, or a little ooze. I&#x2019;ll take the ooze. I doubt they&#x2019;d go looking in the caves for us.&#x201D; Lyanna looks her daughter in the eye &#x201C;Talia, no matter what, you have to keep your cool. Can you do that for me? Whatever happens don&#x2019;t take off daddy&#x2019;s calming necklace ok?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Talia touches her necklace. &#x201C;Yes mom,&#x201D; Talia says looking both scared and sheepish.</p>
<p>A rain drop falls between them. They look up at the sky together. Another falls, then rain&#x2026;</p>
<pre><code>******
</code></pre><p>After an arduous hike through the wet woods the family make it to the base of the ooze caves. Lyanna is exhausted. It&#x2019;s pouring rain.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We need shelter mom!&#x201D; Kiara says. Lyanna is shivering.</p>
<p>They enter the cave. Thunder and lightning smash and streak across the sky accentuating the decision.</p>
<p>Once inside it is dark. Kiara casts a quick light cantrip to brighten it a little, and Talia summons a few fire beetles to poke around. &#x201C;They&#x2019;ll keep us warm&#x201D; She says.</p>
<p>Lyanna looks around. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re too close to the entrance. They can still find us. Keep moving.&#x201D;</p>
<p>They walk in a close group deeper into the cave, accompanied by the beetles but quickly find that beneath and around them isn&#x2019;t just rock and root. Something crunches and cracks under their feet. It is bone. Very brittle bone. &#x201C;It smells in here Mom&#x201D; Talia says.</p>
<p>The beetles moved around some more and one encounters a small puddle. There is a hissing noise as it steps in it and the beetle hurriedly retreats. A fine mist hangs in the air, and a light smoke effect can be seen as Lyanna sniffs. &#x201C;Acid!&#x201D; she says worriedly. The cave itself seems to let out a slow moan. &#x201C;This was a mistake and we have to go now!&#x201D; Lyanna declares, turning towards the exit, but it&#x2019;s too late. A sudden gushing waterfall appears behind them blocking the way.</p>
<p>A splash hits one of the fire beetles first. There is a drawn out hissing sound and the beetle staggers away. Kiara quickly powers up her light spell from dim glow to maximum strength. The cave lights up. It is filled with bones everywhere, and where there isn&#x2019;t bone it is like watching a giant moving swirling waterfall. This is no ordinary ooze. It fills the whole cavern, dripping between the bones and moving slickly across the floor and ceiling.</p>
<p>Lyanna instinctually starts summoning. &#x201C;SWAMP THING!!!&#x201D; she shouts. She moves as if through the steps of a dance and calls the Earth to open. The very rock opens up underneath her as she summons. The swamp thing emerges from the ground and growls fiercely.</p>
<p>Kiara too is summoning. She darts her hands back and forth. She swirls her fingers through the air and a pulse of light bursts forth in front of her as an air elemental spontaneously appears in the cavern. It screeches and the noise echoes across the vast room.</p>
<p>Talia tries to summon. As she starts her necklace tightens and shines. Only a small fire beetle appears.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s a moment of silence between them all and a small lizard scurries into the bedrock.</p>
<p>The swamp thing shouts like a wookie. Lurching forward, it sends tendrils into the ooze and they go straight through it. As it pulls them back they are disfigured and brown, as if withering.</p>
<p>Balls of acid and ooze started whizzing past the group of summoner and creatures. Kiara easily dodges. Lyanna is slower, but does not get hit either.</p>
<p>Kiara conjures up lightning and directs it through her air elemental, thereby powering it up, to also strike the ooze.</p>
<p>The lightning explodes into the beast, amplified by the spirit of the air elemental. It seems to open a gash in the monster and for a flash it looks as though it has a giant tumor inside. Liquid simply rushes back in around the cut and the ooze surrounding the group draws even closer.</p>
<p>The room moans like deep laughter.</p>
<p>Lyanna moves too slowly as more acid blobs come flying and fails to dodge an acid blob which hits her in the leg. Her leg quivers where it is struck. &#x201C;Run!&#x201D; She yells, panicked, but there is no visible opening to the room. Only ooze and bone.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s nowhere to go!&#x201D; Kiara shouts back.</p>
<p>Lyanna gestures and starts speaking &#x201C;SPIRIT OF THE FOR&#x201D; but another blob of goo hits her in the face and it turns into a gooey scream.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mom!&#x201D; Kiara shouts. She rips a flask from her hip and slams it on the ground. &#x201C;Clay to LIFE!&#x201D; She shouts.</p>
<p>And a Clay Golem starts coming from the rock below.</p>
<p>Kiara screams at her sister Talia, who has been standing watching all this in horror: &#x201C;RUN! JUST RUN!!!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Talia moves towards a wall. She sees a beetle step towards a glob and the fire on its back touches some of the slime, causing it to burn off. She puts her arms in front of her and a burst of fire shoots out. It opens a gap through the ooze as that section of slime sizzles out of existence. She runs through it.</p>
<p>She looks back at her mother and sister fighting for their lives as the ooze closes in. Then the ooze fills in the gap she blasted. She blasts another hole in the ooze so she can see, shouting for her mother and sister. It fills in again.</p>
<p>She looked at her hands. She looks at the ooze. She looks at her hands again and then steadies herself. She snarls a little with the exertion and starts glowing red.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Open Up!&#x201D; she shouts and fire bursts from her hands opening a new hole in the ooze. Talia runs through the back to her family.</p>
<p>&#x201C;LEAVE THEM ALONE!!!&#x201D; She screams at the encroaching ooze. Her hair lifts from her head and a tremor moves under her skin showing scaly flesh beneath .</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m FIREBORN! YOU DON&#x2019;T SCARE ME!&#x201D; From her hands a jet of fire pulses. The ooze hisses a little, but it seems to never run out of liquid. It barely notices. Now Talia is angry. &#x201C;I&#x2019;M WARNING YOU!!!&#x201D;</p>
<p>A portion of the ooze collapses around the swamp thing enveloping it completely. More ooze splatters on her mother and sister. It is enough that Kiara cannot dodge. Lyanna doesn&#x2019;t appear to be moving. She is covered up to her neck in a glob of ooze.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I SAID STOP!&#x201D; Talia screams at the ooze. Full fire jets pulse from her hands towards the globular mass. This time it presses into the creature slightly. The necklace choker squeezes her neck tighter.</p>
<p>Another part of the ooze collapses and covers the clay golem and air elemental. The elemental gives a muffled shriek as it is practically consumed. The Clay Golem looks confused as it tries to move inside the ooze. It starts to cover over Kiara and Lyanna.  Kiara is still standing, but half inside of ooze.</p>
<p>Talia enrages. Fire bursts from all around her. Her hands go invisible inside the raw jet of flames.</p>
<p>An opening pushes towards what looked like a gross and infected tumor on the inside of this gelatinous creature.</p>
<p>She screams. The choker breaks. There&#x2019;s a boom and a crackle.</p>
<p>Horns grow from her head, wings sprout from her back, fire continues to jet from where her hands were, and a set a talons take shape in their place. A tail sprouts from her backside.</p>
<p>&#x201C;BUUUUUURRRRRRRNNNNNNNNNN!!!&#x201D; She screams. The cave ooze moans in pain as fire reaches the tumor inside of it.</p>
<p>A loud &#x201C;caw caw&#x201D; cry comes from inside her.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Come my friend and BURRRRNNNNNNNNN!&#x201D;</p>
<p>A golden Phoenix shoots forth from her chest and hands. It takes center stage in the room. It screeches and explodes in magnificent light.</p>

<p>Man, time flies when you&#x2019;re feeling swamped.  As they said in Aeon Flux, that which does not kill us makes us stranger.  So, I ran up to vermont, got my shit together, came back, had some rough moments here and there.  I had a long conversation with my wife and Baby 1 about coming home from camp.  That was and is still a big deal to me.  Trying to move on.</p>
<p>I went down to NJ for a little bit.  I have a family reunion there every summer.  Was excited to see my family have a big birthday and anniversary celebration.  That was cool.  Spent some time talking to my family about block chains.  It&#x2019;s pretty important to me to get the word out there.  </p>
<p>I&#x2019;m still waiting on some product changes, but before long I think we&#x2019;ll make it so that people can buy steemmonsters packs from other websites and keep a portion of the sales.  This can turn any website into a profitable business.  I&#x2019;m looking forward to exploring this in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>Steem Monsters continues to take up a large percentage of my time.  The most recent thing is putting together a Kickstarter for it.  That should go live in the next couple of weeks or so.  I got most of the basic copy done in a first draft round.  Now it&#x2019;s time to make the video and really crank this stuff out.  I&#x2019;m pretty sure it&#x2019;s going to be great visibility for the platform, for this project, and help give us some working capital to get fighting and future developments off the ground.</p>
<p>Minnow Support seems to be going ok.  I&#x2019;m seeing a lot of the channels around the steem ecosystem are a little low population.  There&#x2019;s a few standouts where people still seem to be congregating, but between it being summer and low prices it would appear the steem ecosystem including Discord is feeling the lull.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m nearing 100k SP delegated out.  Nearly all of that is in parts of the minnow support project.  It&#x2019;s more than just @minnowsupport.  We have curation, a radio station, and try to support the active members too.  I think I&#x2019;ll take a delegation break after I hit 100k delegated and try to build up my @aggroed account some.  It&#x2019;s fun to have 15k active SP, but I&#x2019;d like to be able to hit posts a little harder&#x2026; so, time to save.</p>
<p>I hope you&#x2019;re enjoying watching the value of crypto coins out there start marching back up.  Here&#x2019;s hoping for new all time highs for crypto and Steem in the near future.  I think that&#x2019;s gonna drag some Steemians back into the mix too.  Should be fun!</p>

<p>Hey guys.  I&#x2019;m super stoked for the show tonight.  Steem Monsters just released the Monster Market and it&#x2019;s booming.  There have been hundreds of sales and thousands of dollars spent.  It&#x2019;s pretty to watch this thing bloom.</p>
<p>Matt&#x2019;s gonna come on the show and we&#x2019;re going to talk about what we&#x2019;re planning on doing, how we can grow the game, some of the next stuff for fighting, the market, and expanding business and the blockchain in general.  It&#x2019;s pretty awesome stuff and you&#x2019;re not gonna wanna miss this.</p>
<h2 id="Logistics"><a href="#Logistics" class="headerlink" title="Logistics"></a>Logistics</h2><p>Show starts in 30 minutes.  It&#x2019;s going to be held in the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network.  Just a word of caution.  Discord has been super wonky lately so who knows how cleanly the show goes.  Worst case guests will hop on in a variety of ways like skype, hangouts, and discord (if it works).</p>
<p>Just hop into minnowpond.org and scroll down through the channels until you see us.</p>
<p>You can also listen in at mspwaves.com/listen.  If you go there you can see my screen too and we&#x2019;ll be talking about stuff on it so maybe that will clarify what we&#x2019;re talkign about.</p>

        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This is part two of the background story for Talia.  Talia is a summoner that will be launched in round 2 or 3 of the cards.  She&#x2019;s going to be in the intro animation and she&#x2019;s based on my second child.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUYCwQ9AFgj6mrbREQdarVb1TEyWrMCKGQ7dtAhJnAWMT/20141106__Talia_Shorts_and_Dragon_face%20(1" alt="20141106__Talia_Shorts_and_Dragon_face (1) (1).png">%20(1).png)</p>
<h2 id="Talons"><a href="#Talons" class="headerlink" title="Talons"></a>Talons</h2><p>Talia sat twiddling her human thumbs on a chair looking sheepish as the firefighters put out another fire that her summoned monsters caused.  Talia would get nervous, scared, or angry and depending on what she was feeling if she wasn&#x2019;t completely in control she&#x2019;d start summoning monsters&#x2026;  That wouldn&#x2019;t be the worst thing in the world.  It happens to a lot of summoners when they are growing up, but Talia wasn&#x2019;t like most other summoners.  She was born to a nature and life spirit, but called on a full red moon.  She was a fire spirit living in the University.</p>
<p>If there&#x2019;s one thing the University doesn&#x2019;t handle very well it&#x2019;s fires.  If there&#x2019;s anything worse than a fire it&#x2019;s many fires.  If there&#x2019;s one thing Talia did it&#x2019;s summon many monsters that created lots of fires.  This apparently was the worst one yet.  It was just a little fire beetle&#x2026; but even those can get red hot.</p>
<p>Her dad Aggroedius came around the corner talking hurridly to the Chancellor holding his bright magic lantern.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t do this.  My research!!! We&#x2019;re so close!&#x201D;  He sounded desparate, and he looked unwell past the burn he had started to feel.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Lyanna is pregnant again.  Kiara is in the academy.  You can&#x2019;t be serious!&#x201D;</p>
<p>The chancellor stopped for a moment.  &#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t just my decision.  And it isn&#x2019;t personal.  Your daughter is an extremely gifted and talented young lady, but we aren&#x2019;t equipped to deal with this.  We&#x2019;re a university.  There&#x2019;s enough alchemical concoctions around here to burn down the Splinterlands and your daughter seems determined to make that happen.  Aggroedius you&#x2019;ve been my friend for 25 years, but your family is endangering us all.  Look in the mirror! Between going back and forth between Scalvin and the fires in the halls.&#x201D;  He gestured around the room to where there were multiple scorch marks left along the otherwise pristine white quartz.  &#x201C;They simply have to leave until she can learn to control herself.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Aggroedius looked crushed and he noticed Talia sitting there.  Talia wasn&#x2019;t supposed to see or hear that&#x2026; but she did.  She was old enough to know it was her fault her family would have to leave home.  The sudden wave of guilt and shame hit her.  She&#x2019;d been doing emotional control lessons with her mom and some of the protection instructors, but it wasn&#x2019;t enough.  She started sobbing and as she did magic emanated around her.</p>
<p>Aggroedius was right there this time to see it.  He had placed a protection spell on her chest to help keep some of this in.  He started casting.  He drank an elixir of clarity.  He called forth the elemental spirits of his ancestors.  His hands moved in quick motion almost like a dance helping to clear his head.</p>
<p>Out of the floor a serpent of the flame started to wiggle and rise.  It looked confused, and then it looked angry.  It looked at the chancellor and at Aggroedious and hissed.</p>
<p>Talia started feeling her fathers calming energy.  It was like cool soothing waves.  She focused on that and started to pull herself together using her emotional control training.  She started to breathe deeply.  She let her fears enter her mind and then leave them.  She&#x2026;</p>
<p>The chancellor seeing the present danger said &#x201C;Enough of this.&#x201D;  He pulled back his tunic grabbed a jar and threw it at the ground by the fire serpent.  Lightening sizzled and the quartz halls shook, but it wasn&#x2019;t enough.  The serpent of the flame was now enraged.  It charged at the chancellor while he was thinking &#x2018;that should have been enough.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Aggroedius called into the air &#x201C;Light the way!&#x201D;  The lantern shifted it&#x2019;s form from magical lantern to magical mace, and he swung down upon the Serpent as it&#x2019;s teeth nearly sank into the chancellor.</p>
<p>Talia again lost control, but this time magical fire started sprouting all around her.  &#x201C;Noooooo&#x201D; she cried, and a burst of flame shot upwards above her bursting through the walls of the quartz tower, into the night, and lit the sky like a shooting star.</p>
<p>Aggroedius put the mace before him and started walking towards his daughter as she screamed.  The heat was searing and it pulled at old burns from the Essence of Lava.  &#x201C;Talia!  You must stop!&#x201D;  But she couldn&#x2019;t.  All she could do was scream.  Her family was moving.  Her new pet Serpent was dead.  it was all her fault.  The magic rushed through her and seemed to almost distort her flesh.  Ripples like scales could be seen under her human skin in the magical glow.  Her eyes turned fiery red.  There was a renewed surge coming, but it stopped abruptly.  The chancellor picked up a piece of quartz she had knocked off the tower and he hit her in the head with it.</p>
<p>The two men exchanged looks.  &#x201C;You have until tomorrow to get her out of here Aggroedius.  May the light the shine for us all.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Aggroedius looked defeated, but nodded.</p>
<p>Lyanna wasn&#x2019;t happy.  Being 6 months pregnant and having to move across the world with a uncontrolled fire born was one thing, bringing her sister was another.  Aggroedius was saying he couldn&#x2019;t come for another month, and if that wasn&#x2019;t bad enough there&#x2019;s now rumors of serpentine soldiers and even a report of a cerebus roaming the land outside the city!</p>
<p>In fact she was wasn&#x2019;t just unhappy&#x2026; she was pissed.  It wasn&#x2019;t just the hormones.  Honestly anyone leaving like this would be pissed.  Her husband suffered from the burn, some kind of spiritual possession, and either or can&#x2019;t or won&#x2019;t leave his research to find a cure for either.  Her children were a wreck.  One just tried to burn down the tower.  The other was going to when she found out she would have to leave.  Kiara had just made it into the Academy, and now she was being pulled out.  Lyanna was with child.  At least this one wasn&#x2019;t burning her from the inside out.  But even their friends were scared to travel with them because of the &#x201C;Flaming Red Head.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Talia was just a girl.  A simple human girl.  It didn&#x2019;t make sense that such a little lady could summon such monstrous flames, but the quartz tower begged to differ&#x2026;</p>
<p>Aggroedius wouldn&#x2019;t budge on leaving either.  The lunar arrangement is what he&#x2019;d been waiting on for almost two years.  The White moon was full and the black moon was empty.  If there was a chance to rid himself of Scalvin with any help for lunar magic he would have to wait just a few more weeks and the it would be perfect.  Then he said he&#x2019;d meet up with them.</p>
<p>Aggroedius started taking their padlocked chests to the wagon at the base of the tower.  She peered through the window.  Travoneous and Natalium at least were there.  They apparently volunteered to travel with themt.  A favor pulled in by Aggroedius having helped them pass their entrance exams to the Academy many moons ago.  Hopefully the rumors of the serpentine soldiers were fake, but she felt a little better knowing that two Silvershield Warriors were coming with them.  That made it so they were a party of 3 summoners (even though two were just children) and two Silvershield Warriors.  She wanted to cry, but just set to finish up packing.</p>
<p>Dawn was slightly past them.  The family huddled together in a hug one last time by the wagon.  They stood there for a minute.  The girls cried, Lyanna already looked exhausted, and it hadn&#x2019;t even fully dawned on Aggroedius yet&#x2026;  &#x201C;If you find Ouasthma on your journey ask him for my father&#x2019;s mace if you will.&#x201D;  Aggroedius said.</p>
<p>The joke fell flat.  No one wanted to think about the cave ooze that almost killed him 20 years ago.  Nor did she want to think about the Mace of Plenty he left buried in it.  Seriously&#x2026; sometimes this man didn&#x2019;t get even the simplist of things.</p>
<p>She put a hand upon his face.  He held her hand. They touched foreheads together.  They breathed for a few moments.  Aggroedius put his hand on the stomach of his wife.  &#x201C;Be kind to your mother.&#x201D;  He said.  She pulled herself away and into the wagon.</p>
<p>Lyanna and the children got into the wagon and watched as Aggroedius started shrinking into the horizon.</p>
<p>Two days had passed mostly without incident.  There was some sniffling from the girls, but the larger problem was boredom.  Being in a carriage is boring.  That left Kiara thinking about the Academy and everything she was missing.<br> Talia was left thinking about being the reason they all had to leave.  The only thing worse than the boring part for the girls was the discomfort for Lyanna.  The carriage was nice, but it&#x2019;s still a carriage ride across a continent while pregnant&#x2026;</p>
<p>The carriage halted abruptly.  She could hear the muffled talking of the Silvershield brothers through the wood and quartz of the carriage.  Travoneous came in through the roof opening.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Lyanna, we&#x2019;re pretty sure we&#x2019;re being followed by Serpentine Soldiers.&#x201D; He said gruffly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mom?!?&#x201D; Kiara said.  &#x201C;What do we do?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Talia&#x2019;s eyes went wide.  Serpentine Soldiers here???  Her blood started racing.  She started to do her breathing work to calm herself down&#x2026; but she was scared.  In part&#x2026; she could&#x2026; sense them&#x2026;  This wasn&#x2019;t good.  She started rocking back and forth and began to glow.</p>
<p>Lyanna was now unsure of what to do.  Aggroedius had protection spells that could calm this child down&#x2026; but if she starts raging here there isn&#x2019;t much that Lyanna has in her magical bag of tricks to calm her down.  She pulled Talia onto her lap with a pregnant grunt.  &#x201C;Shhhhh, buddy, we&#x2019;re going to be ok, no one will hurt us.  We have Silvershield Warriors with us.</p>
<p>Kiara started thinking about the limited amount of training that she had taken already.  She started working through some of the movements, thoughts, motions and swirls to summon.  Her best so far was an air elemental.  She was hoping she wouldn&#x2019;t need to call one.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ember and Ash&#x201D; Natalium shouted.  Then there was a thunk on the carriage and then another.  Arrows.</p>
<p>Lyanna pushed the hatch up and shouted at Natalium &#x201C;Go!&#x201D;  He looked at her like she couldn&#x2019;t handle the ride&#x2026; &#x201C;But you&#x2019;re pregnant?&#x201D;  He said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you think I know that!?!&#x201D;  Another arrow hit the carriage.  &#x201C;Just go!</p>
<p>She could faintly here dogs barking&#x2026;  Cerebus.  This wasn&#x2019;t good.  &#x2018;There&#x2019;s been peace&#x2019; she thought.  &#x2018;Why are they attacking?&#x2019;</p>
<p>Talia accidentally summoned a fire beetle inside the carriage.  &#x201C;Shoo Shoo&#x201D; her mother called at it as she pushed it out the carriage.</p>
<p>The Serpentine Soldiers were fast, but they were no match for beasts at the front of the carriage.  They also seemed to stop at the fire beetle.  The carriage moved well past them and arrows ceased to rain.  Talia saw them through the back window.  Somehow they seemed ok now and she calmed down watching them fade.</p>
<p>An hour or so from then a very exhausted and uncomfortable Lyanna told Natalium to stop the carriage.  &#x201C;We&#x2019;re getting out!&#x201D;  </p>
<p>Natalium &#x201C;M&#x2019;Lady!  Are you mad?!?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Lyanna said firmly &#x201C;They&#x2019;re hunting a carriage not a woman and children on foot.  You can&#x2019;t be more than a days ride from East Haven.  Take the carriage and race to town.  We&#x2019;ll be ok.  There&#x2019;s bound to be more of them around here.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Natalium &#x201C;What will you do?  If you are harmed Aggroedius will have my head.  Peace be damned.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Lyanna looked to the West and saw the ooze caves in the distance.  We&#x2019;ll head there.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mom, that seems insane, we know that beasts lurk in there.  They haven&#x2019;t been cleared since Dad lost his mace.  He&#x2019;s said that over and over to people to warn them.&#x201D;  Kiara said.</p>
<p>Lyanna looked back behind them.  &#x201C;Serpentine Soldiers, cerebus, or a little ooze.  I&#x2019;ll take the ooze.  I doubt they&#x2019;d go looking in the caves for us.  They&#x2019;ve mapped these lands too ever since that Scarlet Witch has been coming to our lands on her scouting missions.  It seems a poor choice to head to the ooze.  That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;ll go.  You two take the cart and head for town.  We&#x2019;ll head to the caves.  Hopefully they&#x2019;ll follow you and you&#x2019;ll be able to get help from the East Haven Watch.  There&#x2019;s a SilverShield outpost there.   Kiara keep your sword ready.  Take some food from the carriage and pack it up.  Toss it in bags for you and Talia to carry.  Talia.  You&#x2019;re coming with us.  No matter what you have to keep your cool.  Can you do that for me?  Can you promise mommy?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes mom.&#x201D;  Talia said.  And she meant it.  Something about them didn&#x2019;t scare her after she&#x2019;d seen them.  She felt ok.  Then she felt a drop.  And another one.  Rain&#x2026;</p>
<p>After an arduous hike through the wet woods the family made it to the base of the ooze caves.  Lyanna was exhausted.  Every muscle hurt.  Healing magic can cure an open flesh wound, but it doesn&#x2019;t do much for cramps and muscle soreness.  She found a big rock and sat on it. </p>
<p>&#x201C;We need shelter mom!&#x201D;  Kiara said.  It was true too.  The rain wasn&#x2019;t freezing, but it was cool to the touch.  Lyanna knew that if she was sitting outside for long after she stopped moving she&#x2019;d be freezing.  She looked at her belly.  She looked at the cave.  She looked at her little starting warrior and red headed child.  She closed her eyes.  <code>Spirit of the Forest help us</code> she thought.  &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go inside.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Thunder and lightening smashed and streaked across the sky accentuating the decision.</p>
<p>Once inside it was dark.  Kiara cast a quick light cantrip to brighten it a little, and Talia summoned a few fire beetles to poke around.  &#x201C;They&#x2019;ll keep us warm&#x201D; She said.  Lyanna looked around.  They were far enough in that no one from outside would see the glow off of them.  They scurried off a bit and it looked like there might be people farther off.  They could see shadows of something that looked human on the walls.</p>
<p>They walked closer and quickly found that beneath and around them wasn&#x2019;t just rock and root.  It crunched and cracked.  It was bone.  Very brittle bone.</p>
<p>The beetles moved around some more and one found a small puddle.  Hissss it sounded as it stepped in it.  The air grew a fine mist, and a light smoke both cleared their noses and burned them&#x2026;. <code>acid</code> Lyanna thought.  The cave itself seemed to let out a slow moan.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This was a mistake&#x201D; she claimed.  &#x201C;We have to go!&#x201D;  But it was too late.  A splash hit one of the fire beetles first.  There was a hissss.  Kiara quickly powered up her light spell from dim glow to maximum strength.  The cave lit up.  It was filled with bones everywhere, and where there wasn&#x2019;t bone it was like watching a giant moving swirling waterfall.  This was no ordinary ooze.  It filled the whole cavern.</p>
<p>Fear struck Lyanna first and instinctually she started summoning.  From the ground she called up a Swamp Thing.  She moved as if through dance and called the Earth to open.    The very rock opened up underneath her as she summoned.  He lumbered forth from the ground and growled a fierce growl.  He sent tendrils into the ooze and they just went through it.  When it pulled them back they were disfigured and brown.</p>
<p>Kiara too summoned.  She darted back and forth with her hands.  She swirled the air and a pulse of light burst forth in front of her as an air elemental spontaneously burst into the cavern.  It screached and it echoed across the vast room.</p>
<p>Talia was scared.  She&#x2019;d never used magic like this before.  She was more than scared.  She was terrified.  It wasn&#x2019;t like just seeing the Serpents. This was different.  She tried to summon, but it wasn&#x2019;t working.  She started on her breathing trying to call forth something powerful like she had when the Chancelor was there, but no luck.  She was too terrified and all that she could summon was another fire beetle.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence between them all and a small lizard scurried out of the room.  Then balls of acid and ooze started wizzing by them.  Kiara had studied these things in the academy.  She didn&#x2019;t know of any this large, and the globs were far larger than her teachers had explained.  She conjured up lightening and powered it through her air elemental to then also strike the ooze.</p>
<p>The light exploded into the beast amplified by the spirit of the air elemental.  It seemed to open a gash in the monster and for a flash it looked as though it had a giant tumor inside.  Liquid simply filled back in around the cut and the ooze globbed closer to them.</p>
<p>Lyanna was hit first.  She wasn&#x2019;t as quick as she used to be, and fighting wasn&#x2019;t the first thing you do when pregnant.  The glob stung and burned, but worse yet it made her tired and her leg quivvered where it was struck.  &#x201C;Run!&#x201D;  She said panicked, but the light in the room showed no opening.  </p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no where to go!&#x201D;  said &#x201C;Kiara.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Lyanna suddenly knew it was time.  She was afraid to use them much magic while pregnant, but she had no choice.  She had to save her girls.  She had to save her baby.  She had to call the Spirit of the Forest.  She started gesturing and speaking, but another blob of goo smacked her in the face.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mom!&#x201D; Kiara shouted.  &#x201C;By the LIGHT!&#x201D;  She sreamed.  She didn&#x2019;t know what else to do.  The lightening had barely done anything.  She dodged a blob of acid, and a second one struck off her shield.  She took a flask from hip and slammed it on the ground.  &#x201C;Clay to LIFE!&#x201D;  She shouted!</p>
<p>And a Clay Golem started coming from the rock below.</p>
<p>Kiara screamed at her sister &#x201C;RUN!&#x201D;<br>The fire beetles lit her path first and as they stepped towards the monster the little globs sizzled off of them.  She looked at her sister using the golem as a shield and her mother struggling to even breathe, and her fear started to turn to anger.  &#x201C;MOM!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Kiara screamed again!  &#x201C;JUST RUN!!!&#x201D;</p>
<p>The opening looked to be closing up.  She took another step towards the hole.  She saw the beetle step in a glob and it sizzled and burned off.  She was scared to go through the whole.  She put her arms in front of her and a burst of fire shot out.  It opened a gap in the ooze as the beast sizzled out of existence.  She ran through it.</p>
<p>She looked back at her mother and sister.  She felt scared, and was watching her family lose this fight, but then the ooze filled in the gap she had blasted.  She looked at her hands and blasted another hole in the ooze so she could see, but it looked just as grim.  She looked at her hands.  She looked at the ooze.  She looked at her hands and then steadied herself. She snarled a little.  &#x201C;Open Up!&#x201D;  she cried and fire burst from her hands opening a new hold in the ooze.  Talia walked through the hole and started running back to her family.</p>
<p>&#x201C;LEAVE THEM ALONE!!!!&#x201D;  She screamed at it.  She began to glow red and orange.  Her hair lifted and a tremor moved right beneath her flesh.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m FIREBORN!  YOU DON&#x2019;t SCARE ME!  AND YOU&#x2019;RE NOT GOING TO HURT US ANYMORE!&#x201D;  From her hands pulsed a first jet of fire.  And the ooze hissed a little, but it seemed to never run out of liquid.  It barely noticed.  Now Talia was angry.  &#x201C;I&#x2019;M WARNING YOU!!!!&#x201D;</p>
<p>A portion of the ooze collapsed around the swamp thing enveloping it completely.  More ooze splattered on her mother and her sister.  It was enough that Kiara couldn&#x2019;t dodge.  Lyanna didn&#x2019;t appear to be moving.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I SAID STOPP!&#x201D;  She screamed at the ooze.  Full fire jets pulsed from her hands towards the globular beast.  This time it pressed into the creature slightly.  The tingle of magic started racing through her, but seemed to slow as it hit the protective spell her father had placed at her chest.</p>
<p>Another part of the ooze collapsed and covered the clay golem and air elemental.  The elemental gave a muffled shriek as it was practically consumed.  The Clay Golem looked confused as it tried to move inside the ooze.  Kiara was standing, but more ooze was on her.  Like it was draining her energy away.</p>
<p>Talia couldn&#x2019;t take it anymore.  She was full enraged.  Fire burst from all around her.  It started to sizzle her flesh, but she felt like she didn&#x2019;t need it anymore anyway.  She could feel something harder forming underneath.  As she pushed the fire of her anger through her she could even feel like her body was trying to change, but it kept stopping short at her heart near the protection spell.  She focused on her hands and tried to pulse as much rage through them as she could.  </p>
<p>She looked like the picture books she read of the crazy goblin engineers.  Giant jets of fire burned out of her hands.  They started melting her hands and for a second there was nothing there but magic and fire.  It hurt some, but she wasn&#x2019;t going to let this thing killer her mom or sister!  The ooze seemed to back off just the slightest as it encountered this.  Again, an opening pushed towards what looked like a gross and infected tumor on the inside of this gelatinous creature.</p>
<p>It still wasn&#x2019;t enough.  The ooze simply pulled more liquid from within it somehow, and again a portion collapsed.  It couldn&#x2019;t get close enough to Talia as she was too hot, but it finally engulfed Kiara and Lyanna.  There was nothing left for Talia to do but rage!!!</p>
<p>She thought of every single lesson she&#x2019;d ever had on controlling her anger, she thought of every item her sister had taken without her permission, she thought of every fire she had accidentally set, and she thought about how her birth had almost killed her mom, and she focused on her mother and sister slowing down inside the gel and the magic raced through her.</p>
<p>Horns started growing from her head, wings started poking through her back, fire continued to jet from her hands used to be, and a set a talons started to take shape where her hands had been.  She felt a tail start protruding brom her backside.  She could feel the magic pushing her face outward and her human flesh burning off.  It wasn&#x2019;t enough.  Her father&#x2019;s spell was still there.  She looked at her new claw, looked at her chest, and used the claw to rip open the flesh where her fathers spell had rested.  It hurt, but mostly it was loud.  There was a boom and a crackle.  Then for a second she felt free.  </p>
<p>She looked again at the Giant Ooze and screamed &#x201C;BUUUUUURRRRRRRNNNNNNNNNN!!!!&#x201D;  From her hands came forth a giant flame bigger than any she&#x2019;d ever seen and this time it touched the tumor inside of the ooze, but it wasn&#x2019;t enough.  But as the magic came through her so too did something ancient.  It was as if it was called into existence by the power of her flames and the falling ash on the floor.  Talia could hear a &#x201C;caw caw&#x201D; come from inside her.  it felt like an old friend.  An old and very powerful friend.  With an understanding she didn&#x2019;t quite grasp she called out &#x201C;Come my friend and BURRRRNNNN!&#x201D;</p>
<p>A golden Phoenix shot forth from her chest and hands.  It took center stage in the room screached into the air and exploded in magnificent light.</p>
<hr>
<p>Talia woke to gentle mumbling at her feet.  She sat up slowly and looked at her claws where he thumbs had been.  She didn&#x2019;t really recognize herself, but this felt&#x2026; better?  Across from her sat a very old female.  She had a certain glow about her and wore a deep red cloak.  Talia thought she may have heard of her.   &#x201C;Are you the Scarlet Witch she asked?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Some have called me that!&#x201D;  She answered kindly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Are you here to kill us?&#x201D;  Talia asked.</p>
<p>&#x201C;No my dear,  No one is here to hut you and your family is safe thanks to you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Talia looked around the cavern.  There were Serpentine soldiers and Cerebus dogs.  Some of the Soldiers were facing her and bowing towards her.  Others were painting a mural of a little dragon girl incinerating a gigantic ooze.  Talia smiled and then looked at the scarlet witch.</p>
<p>&#x201C;How did you know we were here?&#x201D;  Talia asked.</p>
<p>The old woman chuckled.  &#x201C;Everyone for miles knew you were here girl.  You nearly caved this whole cavern in my darling.  It looked like the Essence of Lava had erupted herself.  It&#x2019;s quite a power you have there dear.&#x201D;  Talia looked up and saw starlight.  &#x2018;Hey, there had been a rock ceiling there before&#x2019; she thought.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why have you come?&#x201D;  Talia asked.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When I was a child your father came to my home and asked to save your mother.  She saved your mother&#x2019;s life and he promised you would spend time with the Essence of Lava.  I was there and saw it.  She asked me to find you and I&#x2019;ve waited almost a hundred years to meet you young lady.  We&#x2019;re to go home.&#x201D;  The scarlet witch said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And I&#x2019;m to die there?&#x201D;  Talia asked.</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, my dear.  You&#x2019;ll go there to train&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
<p>A Serpentine soldier interupted the conversation when he brought a very large mace over.  &#x201C;My lady.  What would you have us do with thissssss?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Talia glanced at the Mace and remembered some of the pictures of her Grandfather holding it.  &#x201C;Oh&#x201D; . She said &#x201C;that&#x2019;s my grand father&#x2019;s.  It&#x2019;s the mace of plenty.  What&#x2019;s it doing here?&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Scarlet Witch glanced over it.  &#x201C;I believe this was inside of the ooze you shrank.  What should we do with it?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Can you give it back to my dad?&#x201D;  Talia asked.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Consider it done.&#x201D;  The witch said.  &#x201C;My name is Regina.  You can call me Gina if you like.  the serpents are taking your family to East Haven, and we&#x2019;re going to Ferexia.  The Essence of Lava will be so happy to meet you.  I have to say this is just like the dreams I&#x2019;ve been having about this since I was a girl, but I will say this.  I didn&#x2019;t know what to expect from you, but I&#x2019;m so excited to finally meet.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Talia looked at her new talons, her green skin, and was a little sad, but she saw in a glint of moon light in a puddle of ooze that used to belong to a giant monster that she at least she still had her red hair.  &#x2018;This felt better&#x2019; and it was great to get rid of Dad&#x2019;s silly protection spell. </p>
<p>For some reason she trusted and loved this woman already.  &#x201C;When do we start?&#x201D;</p>

            <p>Talia is an unreleased character.  She&#x2019;ll be coming in the next batch or two.  She&#x2019;s based on my second baby.  Here&#x2019;s the start of her origin story.  Kiara is the rainbow warrior, Talia is the dragonish kid, Scavin is the impish demon, and we&#x2019;ll see who the character below the imp is later.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQBM7GjAxWC6rAmhmhEN8RurbFWGisDvfSoFoZPHPw9hZ/image.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Fire-Moon"><a href="#Fire-Moon" class="headerlink" title="Fire Moon"></a>Fire Moon</h2><p>Aggroedius was looking forward to today.  The fire moon would be full tonight and nearly all people of all cities and towns would hold festivals.  There&#x2019;s likely to be drinking and often brawling.  The brawling could be tournaments, duels, or frankly just drunken debauchery.  Even the University and the University professors would sometimes engage.  While magic and alchemy are to be studied what good are they if they can&#x2019;t be used for some fun too.</p>
<p>Also important to note is that Lyanna&#x2019;s mother was at the high tower as well.  That meant she could take Kiara.  That meant he could finally get some alone time with Lyanna again.  His first challenge was that Lyanna looked tired.  Kiara refused to sleep at normal intervals.  She seemed to pick her sleeping habits based on when Lyanna couldn&#x2019;t sleep.</p>
<p>Aggroedius asked his wife &#x201C;when do you think your mom will be around?  I&#x2019;m looking forward to the fire moon festivals.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Lyanna said &#x201C;Sometime around mid day.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Aggroedius swept up Kiara.  &#x201C;Get some sleep Ly.  We&#x2019;ll have fun tonight.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He felt a little sheepish not working that much today.  He&#x2019;d been creating some contact with a small impish demon named Scalvin.  Sometimes you have to consult bizarre allies in the world of magic to make progress.  Some people had recently started succumbing to plague many were calling &#x201C;the burn.&#x201D;  It felt weird to take a day off of research, but it was much needed rest.</p>
<p>HIs mother&#x2019;s side of the family was rumored to be long distant relatives of dragons and lava elementals.  The dragons would say &#x201C;tomorrow can wait.&#x201D;  Though&#x2026; even they may feel different if everyone starts feeling the burn.</p>
<hr>
<p>The morning passed easily.  Watching Kiara walking was fun.  It&#x2019;s a pretty normal activity, but it seemed very special when she did it.  He was happy to watch her explore the world.  He took her outside to the market.  She kept trying to touch everything, and when she wasn&#x2019;t touching things she was still trying to put them in her mouth.  As a parent he was always careful to keep the magical things away and high up on shelves in the house, but in the markets the traders weren&#x2019;t always so careful.  He basically spent the morning hunched over running after a toddler.</p>
<p>He came back home to a well rested Lyanna talking to her mother.  &#x201C;How was the market she asked?  Could you get a good deal with fish trader Jararal?&#x201D;  Aggroedius was proud of the fact that Kiara came back without injury.  He hadn&#x2019;t been thinking about fish.  &#x201C;No dear, we were wandering.  I didn&#x2019;t get any food while there.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Lyanna, looked briefly annoyed, but her mother stepped in.  &#x201C;It&#x2019;s ok Ly, I&#x2019;ll go back to the market with Kiara and we&#x2019;ll find something for today.  &#x201C;Whose grandma&#x2019;s darling?&#x201D;  She inquired of Kiara.  &#x201C;It&#x2019;s good to see you Aggroedius.&#x201D;  </p>
<p>Aggroedius liked Lyanna&#x2019;s mother Wynne.  She motioned to take Kiara.  He passed her over.  Grandma and baby looked happy.  Wynne got ready to head out.</p>
<p>When she finally did leave Aggroedius didn&#x2019;t waste time.  He wrapped his arms around his wife and kissed her neck.  &#x201C;Aggroedius, the fire moon celebrations are later tonight&#x2026;&#x201D;  She said.</p>
<p>Aggroedius told her &#x201C;I think we should start them early&#x2026;&#x201D;  He started firmly caressing her body with his strong hands.  &#x201C;Aggroedius, it&#x2019;s a fire moon.  I&#x2019;m not carrying a fire child in my belly nor do I want to risk that.  You&#x2019;ve said before that you come from efreets, and elementals, and dragons on your mothers side.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Aggroedius was undaunted.  &#x201C;My mother dyed her hair and I never saw no truth in those tales.&#x201D;  It was mostly true&#x2026;  &#x201C;If true they are 400 yeas old.  The blood is thin.  We&#x2019;ll be fine my dear.&#x201D;  She didn&#x2019;t quite agree with his assessment, but the fire moon energy was in her too.  She felt rested finally, and this would be nice.  She gave into his embrace.</p>
<hr>
<p>Seven months later and she burned in agony.  She would sit in the lake all day pulsing her healing magic all over her own body, but it was getting worse.  She was with child, but this was no ordinary child.  She could feel the magical heat emanating from her womb.  As the child grew larger it grew hotter.</p>
<p>Aggroedius did the best he could to keep protection spells on his wife, take kiara whenever possible, keep working on his research with Scalvin, and try not to be murdered by his unhappily pregnant wife.  It was understandable.  She was of the earth and occasionally would belch fire.  Acid reflux be damned spitting fire is a million times worse.</p>
<p>Though sleeping was becoming a problem.  She&#x2019;s frequently waking up with a fever and screaming in pain.  The healers swear the baby is fine, but the mother is not.  Lyanna is a powerful healer, but it&#x2019;s different when the infection causing the trouble is your own child.  </p>
<p>When she awoke last night in pure agony that seemed to rattle the whole city Aggroedius had had enough.  The spells weren&#x2019;t working.  His own protection magic wasn&#x2019;t working.  He wasn&#x2019;t willing to use experimental alchemy on them.  The healers had nothing else to offer&#x2026;   Aggroedius knew without help she would die.  It was time to go within.</p>
<p>Aggroedius set off to the lab while his wife and unborn were at the lake.  She can be ok for a day there.  He lit all of burners and set them at maximum.  He closed all the doors so no one would see what he was doing.  It wasn&#x2019;t quite forbidden&#x2026; but Aggroedius knew he may need to go farther than one should because the line was so far back.  The heat was getting to him already.  He stripped off his robe and sat bare chested cross legged and prepared for astral travel.</p>
<p>First he cleared his mind and let the wandering thoughts of his wife and baby come and go as they needed.  He let the pressures of teaching the young summoners what he&#x2019;s learned enter his thoughts and leave.  He simply breathed.  Calming breaths.  And as they came in he would soak in the energy of the planet below, and he would funnel in the energy of the sun and sky from above.  His body became a great conductor of al things magic.  From his heart he produced a single golden thread of magic.  Pure in essence with a touch of it&#x2019;s own spirit and he breathed life into it.</p>
<p>The golden thread barely eeked out of him, but as his channelling grew it thickened and a golden chord wrapped in a white protective lace like energy flowed from his chest.  It travelled directly above him and created a golden orb.  The orb was as small as a pea at first, but as he pumped this golden energy into it it expanded and filled the room and completely encompassed him.</p>
<p>Inside this orb he lost track of himself, of time, of thoughts, of space, of being a physical being.  All he felt was the great connection to the all eternal.  The golden light sensing his intention felt pulled  to Ferexia, The Burning Lands.  The golden light felt the pull and shot out.  It passed through walls, doors, windows and people.  Neither flesh nor quartz would stop it.  The golden light travelled not just through space but time as well.</p>
<p>It went straight across the great Fissure, through the embered lands travelling above the small fire beetles and great rocs alike.  It moved to Talithianna, the Great Volanco.  There it stopped by the home of essence of lava herself.  While no being in it&#x2019;s journey could see this golden light the lava soul turned  her eyes and gazed straight at it.  She waited patiently as Aggroedius brought himself behind his golden light in his golden orb and brought his astral self to join her.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aggroedius&#x2026; to what do I owe this unexpected visit?&#x201D;  she asked him telepathically.</p>
<p>To Aggroedius the sudden onslaught of the mental strength of this great essence was almost more than he could bear.  The voice in his head sounded like a thousand thunderstorms crashing in the sky at once.  The golden orb istelf wavered and nearly disappated.  If not for years of training and a will to see it done no matter the cost for his wife.  The storm passed nearly as quickly as it hit.  Sweat dripped out of every pour of his body in his lab, and the temperature of the room grew hot.  He calmed his breathing and steadied himself before the great lava essence.  </p>
<p>The heat of the room not only effected him, but began to heat the glassware, quartz, and dragon glass of his lab.  The bottle he used to call forth Scalvin started building pressure, and a barely audible hiss started leaking.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My lady&#x201D; he started.  &#x201C;It is with dire haste that I come to you.  Though the magic of efreet, lava and phoenix lie in my ancestry it would seem to be hundreds of years back.  My wife is with child and only through the rarest of portals on a full fire moon has a spirit been pulled from that line.  My wife is human and life bonded to the path of nature.  I call the world of spirit and alchemy my home.  Neither of us is prepared for this.  I beg you, as your distant son, spirit father to one of your brood, and desparate man wishing life for mother and child.  Help us, please.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Spirit of Lava let the words echo through her.  She felt for the baby&#x2019;s spirit.  She let her own mind wander to touch upon the soul of the child and smiled.  Oh yes&#x2026; she thought.  Woah, she thought as the depth of the moment dawned on her.  This has been foretold and she let out a slight laugh.</p>
<p>The laugh sounded like thunder straight into his ears.  The gloden globe around him expanded as if it were a balloon heated.  The light flickered on and off and nearly burst.  He was filled with pain.  His ears started bleeding, his head felt like it was on fire, parts of his flesh suddenly starting to burn and sear.  In the tiny window he forced his soul to exist all he could see was Lyanna.  He had fallen deeply in love at first sight.  He told his friends he would marry her the day they met and they all had laughed at him, but this was written in the stars and eternal history of the grand creator.  He saw his wife nearly dying and writing in agony of birth.  Through the pain and agony of the laugh he steadied his breathing and readied himself for her words.</p>
<p>Inside his lab the alchemical amalagram would tolerate no more heat.  The bottle in the plain black glass broke and the mixture fell on the floor.  Scalvin started to take shape.</p>
<p>The esssence of Lava looked at Aggroedius in pain and determination.  She knew the spirit well that he had called forth into the world.  Perhaps he was a man and a family worth saving.  &#x201C;I shall spare her life, but the child will come here for a time&#x201D; she whispered so she wouldn&#x2019;t shatter the man.</p>
<p>Blood burst from his ears and nose and burned as it travelled down his skin.  More fissures ripped apart his skin and burning wounds appeared across his body.  &#x201C;I accept.&#x201D;  For a just a beat he saw a little red girl staring at him too from the base of the volcano.  Then with little motion the Essence of Lava cast a spell and Aggroedius found himself flying through space and time faster than he&#x2019;d ever dreamt possible.  The universe passed around him and through in in the blink of an eye.  It moved so fast he missed nearly all of it, but swore a golden pheonix brushed past him and bowed if only for the briefest of moments.  Then he opened his eyes.</p>
<p>In his hand he held a small jar that he knew would save his wife&#x2019;s life, and above him he saw the demon Scalvin seared from the heat but grinning ear to ear.  In any other state on any other day Aggroedius could have crushed this spirit and blinded him or splattered him with light so intense it would cease to exist, but on this day none of that was possible.  Scalvin intertwined his spirit with the  broken and weakened body and soul of Aggroedius.</p>
<p>When Aggroedius woke he felt different.  His body was in pain.  He was covered in blood.  He could feel a strange voice in his head and the memory of his voyage stirred him some.  He looked at his hand and saw a small jar.  It was worth it.</p>
<p>He sat up slowly.  The first thing the do was wash off.  He looked like he&#x2019;d been in a war.  He was covered in cuts and blood.  He stood under the safety shower and pulled the cord.  He instantly regretted it.  Every part of his body lit up in pain as the water touched him.  It was agony, but after a second or two his body calmed slightly by the touch of the water and the blood ran down into the drain.  He started to feel slightly more like himself.</p>
<p>He found some towels above the safety shower and wrapped himself part as towell and part as bandage.  The turned red quickly, but it didn&#x2019;t look like he was still bleeding anywhere.  He looked in the mirror and for a second thought he saw not only himself, but Scavin still in the room.  He turned around, but saw no one there.  He could swear he heard mocking laughter.</p>
<p>He gave himself a few minutes to dry and then pulled the bandages off.   He looked ugly.  He had  cuts over his body,  and dried blood still in places, but he was ok.  He grabbed his clothes and opened the door to his lab.</p>
<p>He did his best as he struggled to walk to the lake.  The path itself would be a light, enjoyable, and refreshing walk on any other day.  Today it was arduous.  His muscles ached.  Trying to go up a stair was like climbing a mountain.  He would lean his arms into his legs to help push them he could climb, but it was opening up the cuts on his legs again.  He wanted to rest, but he could hear his wife howling in agony.  A voice in his head she&#x2019;ll die no matter what you do.</p>
<p>When he got to the lake she was half in and out of consciousness.  The in consciousness part was pain.  Her whole body was red with heat even as she was in the lake.  He approached past the healers.  Some could sense he wasn&#x2019;t well, but he was determined.  He sat beside his wife, procured the bottle, and said drink.  </p>
<p>The salty and ashy drink was gross.  It was like drinking burnt eggs.  She coughed and spattered.  When it hit her stomach though it was as if her baby finally had something it needed.  Almost immediately the child stopped producing heat, and soon her skin went back to flesh toned from red.  She awoke some and as she looked at her husband could see a changed man and upon further inspection saw fresh blood leaking from different parts of his outfit.  &#x201C;What have you done?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Part Two will be entitled Talons</p>
