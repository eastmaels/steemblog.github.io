        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmRyQGq91TECBfsCqbNsRvqdqZD4ktmbgu8rGXPK4yvTcY/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The github for Nitrous is now live: <a href="https://github.com/eonwarped/nitrous" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/eonwarped/nitrous</a>.  It&#x2019;s fully open source.  You can track the changes we&#x2019;re making and see how we&#x2019;re turning condenser into a more revenue friendly tool.  We started closed, but it didn&#x2019;t long to decide to open source it.  As I mentioned before you can go from closed to open, but going back closed is impossible once the genie is out of the bottle.  So, we just took a few days to make sure it was the right call for us.</p>
<p>Now that we are open source it means that if you want to see Nitrous do more things you can help!</p>
<h2 id="Critical-Priority"><a href="#Critical-Priority" class="headerlink" title="Critical Priority"></a>Critical Priority</h2><p>Getting revenue in the door as soon as possible for users of Nitrous is our highest priority.  Steemit.com is integrating freestar (I think it&#x2019;s freestar.com) services into their site.  Adwords and other options exist to generate revenue.  We&#x2019;re going to work on this ourselves, but if anyone that&#x2019;s part of the open source movement wants to help us that would be great.</p>
<p>Short term figuring out how to easily allow custom instances of Nitrous to incorporate adsense or similar ads would be very helpful!  More broadly though&#x2026;</p>
<h1 id="Problem-Statement"><a href="#Problem-Statement" class="headerlink" title="Problem Statement"></a>Problem Statement</h1><p>The challenge for the steem ecosystem is finding advertisers, and it&#x2019;s especially hard when sites are new.  If we go with some of the traditional advertising it&#x2019;ll make money in the short run, but in the long run utilizing other people&#x2019;s ad systems will always net less money than if we run our own.  Furthermore, the adwords stuff will likely generate less revenue than a crypto based system.  It&#x2019;ll also likely do things like pay in fiat, which isn&#x2019;t always convenient.  In short we need our own ad revenue system that can tie all Nitrous instances together.</p>
<h1 id="Vision-Statement"><a href="#Vision-Statement" class="headerlink" title="Vision Statement"></a>Vision Statement</h1><p>In my vision for Steem Engine and Nitrous there&#x2019;s a central place that advertisers can purchase ads and site operators can sell ads.  There&#x2019;s a market for it.  There&#x2019;s a top banner, side banners, and bottom banners (feed is through promotion in the site rather than banner ads) which can be traded.</p>
<p>The closest thing I can think of is Nicehash.  An advertiser puts up a bid for 1 cent per click for 1000 clicks, and if they are the highest bidder their advertisement will run.  They put money into a contract or account to start the ads and the money is transferred as the ads run.  If a different advertiser comes along and is willing to pay 1 eng per click for 1000 clicks then sites would switch over to showing those banner ads until they run out money, and then revert back to 2 eng per for 1000 click ads.</p>
<p>Steem-Engine would take a small cut (3-5% initially and trend down over time as volume increased) of the action for facilitating the trade and expanding the use cases and tooling.</p>
<p>Now with this system functioning people with sites that generate traffic will get money which should in theory offset what they have to pay to run the site!  </p>
<h1 id="Market-cap"><a href="#Market-cap" class="headerlink" title="Market cap"></a>Market cap</h1><p>The second way sites make money is doing &#x201C;programmatic selling&#x201D; like steemit inc does.  Hopefully these nitrous sites have much smaller costs than Steemit Inc does so the programmatic selling can be much smaller.</p>
<p>Steem has 1M accounts and 50k active users.  It has a market cap of 110M.  How much do you think a community with 5k active accounts will be worth?  Do you think you can make a community with 500 or 5000 people?  Does that seem attainable?</p>
<p>If steem-engine.com charges for scotbot or Nitrous do you think you can use ad revenue that will come along soon or selling tokens to settle the cost?</p>

<p>Steemit has started engaging in the rewards conversation.  I think this is a good thing.  It&#x2019;s a worthy conversation.  I think before the Steem community or Steemit can figure out the perfect rewards curve I think we first have to define what this chain actually is.  To me Steem is a marketplace built on a blockchain for startups.  Come here, engage the community, find a need, build an app, launch it, solve problems, and get money. </p>
<p>Are we a social media blockchain?  I think we moved past that.  We are a blockchain for apps with a big one being steemit.com and social media.  But Steem is no longer a social media blockchain.</p>
<p>I think it begs the question of should the reward pool of the social media application be comprised of steem anymore?  I&#x2019;ve seen this popping up a number of times and think it&#x2019;s a worthy question.  Maybe an smt would be more appropriate when they launch.  This would involve shrinking the inflation down substantially to just funding a worker proposal system and paying the witnesses to run servers.  All of the posting and rewarding would go through the SMT.  It&#x2019;s a fairly radical change, and one that I think the community should weigh in on.</p>
<p>If the steem stakeholders still want Steem distributed via inflation and proof of brain the next question is what reward system to choose, and for that there are tons of answers.  The different answers will have different known and unknown effects.  I think it&#x2019;s likely impossible to find the one perfect solution since there will be winners and losers in every scheme.</p>
<p>What I like is the idea that various communities can make their own rules.  Via scotbot and nitrous or via SMTs whenever they hit this community will have the ability to define how the distribution works on their own accord.  You no longer have to find a 1 size fits all rewards process.  You just have to find what works for your community.  This can lead to experimentation.  This can lead to competition and finding what works best.  I&#x2019;m pretty excited for this.</p>
<p>I think scotbot and Nitrous as well as SMTs whenever they arrive have the ability to radically reshape the landscape.  We can reengage users we&#x2019;ve lost.  We can attract new people to new communities.  We&#x2019;ll start getting wins and seeing what&#x2019;s possible.</p>
<h2 id="The-Payoff"><a href="#The-Payoff" class="headerlink" title="The Payoff"></a>The Payoff</h2><p>Steemit has 1M accounts and 50k active users.  The market cap right now is 100M USD.  If a community captures 1%, so 500 users could they get a 1M USD valuation?  500 users seems pretty achieveable.  Maybe it&#x2019;s not quite as good as the core chain.  Maybe it&#x2019;s only 10% as good.  Would 500 users get you a marketcap of 100,000 USD?</p>
<p>There appears to be some major magic possible with Steem, scotbot, and Nitrous.  I&#x2019;m not sure where it&#x2019;ll land, but I think there&#x2019;s a promise of financial return and economic freedom.</p>
<p>Those are two amazing things in my book!</p>

<p>So, this baby seems pretty popular.  It&#x2019;s been a few days and we have 4 of them already in the works and several more that are likely coming soon.  It can take a lot to figure out so I&#x2019;m not surprised it takes a few days to make decisions.  You&#x2019;ll see a couple of names you might already know hopping along soon.  It&#x2019;s getting kinda hot in here!!!</p>
<h1 id="Why-would-you-go-through-this"><a href="#Why-would-you-go-through-this" class="headerlink" title="Why would you go through this?"></a>Why would you go through this?</h1><p>I can&#x2019;t tell you what&#x2019;s right for you, your family, and your finances, but for me the exciting part is the future potential.  First off if you&#x2019;re successful I think you can get a market cap that&#x2019;s worth real money.  10k active users is 1/5 of what steem has as a blockchain.  Steem has a market cap of $112M right now.  You&#x2019;re not guaranteed 1/5 of that, but if you get anywhere close you&#x2019;re gonna be a happy camper.</p>
<p>Second off, now&#x2019;s the time.  There&#x2019;s a 20% discount available by purchasing the tokens on the market.  I already sold 25% of those so it won&#x2019;t last long.  They are being consumed by people making a Scot, distributing it with Scotbot, and viewing it in their custom website powered by Nitrous.</p>
<h1 id="What&#x2019;s-the-process"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-the-process" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s the process?"></a>What&#x2019;s the process?</h1><p>Scot is a 100eng transfer on the web with a short list of settings.<br>Scotbot is 1000eng and you have to share the active key for the account. You also gotta read up on the settings, which are fairly technical, to decide how your community should work.  This payment is automated too.</p>
<p>Nitrous is different.  It&#x2019;s so new that we can&#x2019;t even accept automated payment for it yet!  For now, people that are starting it are doing the scot and scotbot steps through steem-engine.com, messaging me in discord, and transferring 650 eng to steem-eng to get started.  Once that&#x2019;s done I get them in touch with Eon (the dev) and try to get you up as quickly as we can.</p>
<h1 id="The-costs&#x2026;"><a href="#The-costs&#x2026;" class="headerlink" title="The costs&#x2026;"></a>The costs&#x2026;</h1><p>Seems like a shit ton of people want this, and then see the cost and get frustrated.  A few things about this.  We have to run a business.  I know crypto people want things for free, but free doesn&#x2019;t automatically scale well.  Growing a business takes leadership and incentive.  If there&#x2019;s no money coming in it&#x2019;s hard to incentivize people to do things.  With money coming in we&#x2019;re able to hire devs, get servers up and running, upgrade the look and feel, and get things moving!  </p>
<p>There&#x2019;s little concern about Scot.  100eng to make a token seems to have been accepted pretty well.</p>
<p>$200 to setup Nitrous and $50/month to run it hasn&#x2019;t run into many problems.  Especially when I share that Nitrous requires it&#x2019;s own server to run for just your website then hopefully that&#x2019;s a little more clear.  We&#x2019;re doing some custom work on each install.  If there&#x2019;s a lot of custom work we&#x2019;ll be charging $100/hr (paid in ENG).  So far it&#x2019;s mostly simple stuff and we&#x2019;re trying to get it into the sites as we create them without further charges.  Anyway, there hasn&#x2019;t been a lot of issues here so far.</p>
<p>Scotbot is where the challenges lie.  It costs 1000 ENG to get started.  That&#x2019;s around $300.  People seem fairly understanding of that.  The one that folks really are either scared of or don&#x2019;t like is the 1ENG/active user per month.  </p>
<p>I get that it can be daunting.  If you get a lot of users how will you pay for this?  Where will the money come from?  How will you keep the project alive?</p>
<h1 id="Token-sales-and-ad-revenue"><a href="#Token-sales-and-ad-revenue" class="headerlink" title="Token sales and ad revenue"></a>Token sales and ad revenue</h1><p>Well, all of that goes back to token sales and advertising.  If you airdrop all of your token on day 1 and don&#x2019;t have any left to sell that&#x2019;s probably bad for you or you&#x2019;re going to need an alternative source of cash to support the network.  Reserving and selling the token may have to be the way to pay for this service initially.  Keep in mind though that having some costs is part of what will give the token value.  </p>
<p>I know it doesn&#x2019;t exist yet, but this is day 2 or something.  We&#x2019;ll get banner ads on the site that you can easily monetize and work to improve the revenue stream over time.  So, who you collect today will be worth ad dollars in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Is-the-price-of-scotbot-high-or-low-What&#x2019;s-the-alternative"><a href="#Is-the-price-of-scotbot-high-or-low-What&#x2019;s-the-alternative" class="headerlink" title="Is the price of scotbot high or low?  What&#x2019;s the alternative?"></a>Is the price of scotbot high or low?  What&#x2019;s the alternative?</h1><p>Well, let&#x2019;s start with Steem.  Right now the proof of brain requires essentially 21 witnesses to operate.  Each one requires 110k steem/yr right now.  So, that&#x2019;s ~2.3M steem for ~50k active users.</p>
<p>Scotbot piggy backs on the steem blockchain.  If you get 50k users you&#x2019;ll owe 600,000 eng/yr, but thats way less than you&#x2019;d be paying to run dpos on your own.  It&#x2019;s about a 75% reduction compared to running your own full fork of steem.  It&#x2019;s also technically vastly easier and doesn&#x2019;t make you start your community from scratch or lose any of the tooling (like keychain) that&#x2019;s already built for steem.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s possible we&#x2019;ll scale pricing in the future especially if we add staking to ENG.  That is under consideration, but for now and likely through at least 10k users we&#x2019;ll be sticking with 1eng/active user per month.  An active user is someone who at a bare minimum has staked your token.</p>
<h1 id="Nitrous-is-booming-right-now-as-we-speak"><a href="#Nitrous-is-booming-right-now-as-we-speak" class="headerlink" title="Nitrous is booming right now as we speak!"></a>Nitrous is booming right now as we speak!</h1><p>If you have a community that you want to power with Nitrous now&#x2019;s the time to capture first mover advantage.  Now&#x2019;s the time to collect community members.  Now&#x2019;s the time to to pull this together.  Popular communities are already forming and there&#x2019;s a good chance that if you wait then the thing you&#x2019;re passionate about will already be in someone else&#x2019;s hands.  Don&#x2019;t be that guy!</p>
<p>Get your scot created, setup scotbot, and then for now just dm me in Discord- <a href="https://discord.gg/whqnzqT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/whqnzqT</a></p>
<p>Be blessed and don&#x2019;t miss your chance at your dream community with Nitrous by waiting!</p>

<p>A few years ago before I was even a witness (or just starting)  I realized distribution was broken and the solution I thought of at the time wasn&#x2019;t &#x201C;steem sucks fuck this&#x201D; but &#x201C;I&#x2019;m gonna make my own steem with hookers and blackjack.&#x201D;  So, I asked around for who could do something like make a fork of steem and get it running.  People pointed me to Jesta.  So, as a fairly unknown newb on the platform I start messaging him to see if he could help me setup memethenews as a fork of steem.</p>
<p>Jesta politely blew me off.  I don&#x2019;t blame him.  If me 2 years ago came knocking I&#x2019;d probably blow me off too (though, not the Jerry way).  I mean, looking at it from his perspective the liklihood that a fairly brand new user and non-dev without much stake was gonna make shit happen seemed pretty low at the time.  I also didn&#x2019;t have much money for stuff like this, so I didn&#x2019;t even have a good financial solution to offer.</p>
<p>Anyway, I had to look elsewhere.  The dude I found was modprobe.  He was one of the original coders of the steem blockchain and later went to work on EOS with the Dan migration.  So, we took a few weeks and I paid around $1000 in bitcoin to make a fork of steem that I could launch.  We completed it and I was gearing up to do this when Ned strolls into Steemspeak and says &#x201C;I&#x2019;m gonna tell you all about Smart Media Tokens.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It sounded like it was a neat idea and wouldn&#x2019;t take forever to complete so I said goodbye to memethenews and $1000 I just spent on it, and said &#x201C;ok, I&#x2019;ll just wait for SMTs.&#x201D;</p>
<h1 id="Bear-market"><a href="#Bear-market" class="headerlink" title="Bear market"></a>Bear market</h1><p>When the bear market hit Steemit started scaling back on employees and scope of work. SMTs went from front and center, to maybe we&#x2019;ll just get the lite version out, to SMTs are on hiatus until after MIRA.</p>
<p>When that happened Matt and I realized that the ecosystem needed Steem-Engine and we shouldn&#x2019;t just wait.  Since Harpagon already had the layer 2 solution started we could get it going quickly.  Asgarth pitched in and helped up get the (d)ex coded up and steem-engine.com was born.</p>
<h1 id="Custom-Steem"><a href="#Custom-Steem" class="headerlink" title="Custom Steem"></a>Custom Steem</h1><p>Matt realized that we could get the functionality of SMTs done on the smart contract layer and worked out a lot of details with holger who coded scotbot.  Now without leaving steem you can create your own version of steem, but still take advantage of the existing community and tooling that exists.</p>
<h1 id="The-dream"><a href="#The-dream" class="headerlink" title="The dream"></a>The dream</h1><p>Anyway, I&#x2019;m trying to give perspective on the dream here that we&#x2019;re building through Steem Engine and custom tokens and websites.  Steem has some fundamental distribution issues that I can&#x2019;t fix.  The underlying tech is awesome though and if everyone is empowered to make their own token and have it distribute like Steem it&#x2019;s a thing of beauty.  That&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ve been working on and just had our major break through with Scotbot and Nitrous as demonstrated in the first custom instance of Weedcash.</p>
<p><strong>Get your own Scot, run it with Scotbot, and fuel it with some Nitrous!  When the dust settles and people are making money through ads and promotion into the ecosystem the whole ecosystem can explode.</strong></p>
<p>That means more players for the games we build, more people holding the tokens, more people offering services, more devs building tools, and a nice revival of our ecosystem.  If this coincides with a bull market hang onto your hats.  It&#x2019;s gonna get interesting.  I like to think I&#x2019;m at the vanguard of this ecosystem, and from what I&#x2019;m seeing I&#x2019;m pretty stoked even if there is a divergence in price from future activity for now I don&#x2019;t think it will last too much longer.</p>
<h2 id="When-it&#x2019;s-all-working&#x2026;"><a href="#When-it&#x2019;s-all-working&#x2026;" class="headerlink" title="When it&#x2019;s all working&#x2026;"></a>When it&#x2019;s all working&#x2026;</h2><p>You&#x2019;ll create your token, distribute it with scotbot (or a smart contract version), and run it with Nitrous.  You&#x2019;ll launch an ICO on Steem-Engine through our version of Kickstarter for ICOs, and you&#x2019;ll get some money to attract new users.  You&#x2019;ll put ad space up for sale on an ad portal we operate to run ads on your Nitrous instance.  Now you&#x2019;re making money to lambo-up and also spend some to burn tokens to elevate the token price for the whole community.</p>
<p>Should be fun!</p>

<p><strong>Big Picture</strong>: Your engine needs Nitrous to really blast off!  Nitrous is software to create a custom website that looks like Steem, but is built for your community and shows rewards in your Scot (token)! </p>
<p>With Nitrous up and running you have your own version of Steemit.com, but tailored to you!  The style is yours, the colors are yours, the logo is yours, and the token rewards that are displayed are yours!  The service costs money, but if you do it well you&#x2019;ll make money through token sales, advertising, and new ways to monetize your community.</p>
<p>This is tricky.  It&#x2019;s also worth it.  Forgive me while I put a professor hat back on for a few minutes and try to get you all up to speed on the opportunity in front of you.</p>
<h1 id="What-the-hell-is-all-this-stuff"><a href="#What-the-hell-is-all-this-stuff" class="headerlink" title="What the hell is all this stuff?"></a>What the hell is all this stuff?</h1><p><strong>Steem Stuff</strong><br><strong>Steemit Inc</strong> is a blockchain development company that built the steem blockchain</p>
<p><strong>Steem</strong> is a blockchain which allows for custom data storage outside of posts through a thing called custom json.  It&#x2019;s like leaving post it notes on the blockchain.  Steem is also the name of the cryptocurrency used on the Steem blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>Steemit.com</strong> is a website/application that distributes rewards through proof of brain and proof of bidbot.</p>
<p>As it turns out, steemit.com isn&#x2019;t the only way to view the blockchain.  You can use sites that aren&#x2019;t currently integrated with keychain (old school) like steemit.com or busy.org.  You can also visit more modern sites that do integrate with keychain like steempeak.com or cryptoempirebot.com.</p>
<p><strong>SMTs</strong> are smart media tokens.  The white paper exists, but the tokens don&#x2019;t currently exist.  Some of the code has been written already, but it&#x2019;s unfinished.  SMT lite is a token that&#x2019;s issued directly on the Steem blockchain that can be issued and traded.  Full SMTs are custom tokens that distribute like a customizable version of Steem and live on the primary blockchain level.  </p>
<h1 id="Steem-Engine"><a href="#Steem-Engine" class="headerlink" title="Steem-Engine"></a>Steem-Engine</h1><p><strong>Steem-Engine</strong> is comprised of two majors parts.  A front end and two back ends.  The front end is a private website.  Steem-engine.com is a proprietary front end owned by me and others.  The goals include turning steem-engine.com into a site where any asset class can be exchanged for any other, we help people create their own business or community through tokenization, and we plan to make it the premiere place on the web to launch a security or utility token!</p>
<p><strong>Steem Smart Contract</strong>- Part of the Steem-engine.com backend for the tokens is run off of the steem smart contract platform that harpagon built.  I don&#x2019;t own it.  We coordinate with harpagon, but that&#x2019;s his baby and it&#x2019;s separate from the site.  It&#x2019;s a second layer smart contract platform.  Custom json operations are posted to the chain by users and interpreted and executed by the node (it reads your postit note, and does the thing).  </p>
<p><strong>Steem-Engine.com service backend</strong> We (Steem-engine/beggars) are building services on a separate (second) backend to the site that allows things like automation of tasks to occur on the smart contract platform that harpagon built.  So, trading happens through the frontend by calling on the harpagon backend. Facilitating your airdrop runs on the front end by calling on the second (beggars) backend to execute transfers on the smart contract (harpagon) backend.  </p>
<p><strong>Smart Contract Node status</strong>- The current smart contract node isn&#x2019;t yet fully decentralized, but it is opensource and completely verifiable by people familiar with basic node operation skills and access to github.  The plan is to have a completed Peer-to-Peer layer constructed before the end of 2019 so that the Smart Contract backend is completely decentralized.  This will include block production and rewards paid in newly minted ENG.</p>
<h1 id="Scot"><a href="#Scot" class="headerlink" title="Scot"></a>Scot</h1><p>Scot stands for smart contract organizational token.  Scot is interchangeable with words like coin or token, but specific to Steem-Engine.  When you issue a Scot on Steem Engine it&#x2019;s a smart contract built on the smart contract platform.  After you create your Scot on Steem-Engine.com you have two additional options to help distribute it: Scotbot, and Nitrous!  </p>
<p><strong>Business tokens</strong> -  The tokens you create on Steem-Engine.com we call Scot.  As it turns out Scot already has everything you need to serve as a business token.  You can issue and transfer Scot, and it turns out that&#x2019;s all a business really needs the token to do.  This is like all your IBM stock really needs to do is be issued and transfered.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re selling simple scot tokens it&#x2019;s pretty likely these are actual securities.  If you&#x2019;re selling them in the US then they&#x2019;ll need to be registered or an exemption filed with the SEC otherwise you may be illegally selling securities in the USA.  Our legal services partnership can do that work on your behalf and it&#x2019;ll cost around $10k and allows you to raise unlimited amounts of money from accredited investors (rich people) or up to $5M/yr from accredited and non-accredited investors while avoiding the challenges (financial and reporting) of full registration.  </p>
<p>The cost to create a simple Scot token on the steem-engine platform is 100 ENG.  ENG is initially priced at 1ENG=1Steem, but there&#x2019;s some good deals on the market at times.  So, just creating the token these days is $20-30 bucks and a one time fee.</p>
<h1 id="Community-Tokens-Scotbot-and-Nitrous"><a href="#Community-Tokens-Scotbot-and-Nitrous" class="headerlink" title="Community Tokens: Scotbot and Nitrous"></a>Community Tokens: Scotbot and Nitrous</h1><p>A community token starts like a normal Scot, but distribution of the token is powered by proof-of-brain (or proof of bidbot).  It&#x2019;s a way to incentivize content creators to post to your specific community through rewarding them for the content they create.</p>
<p><strong>Scotbot; Community Tokens with proof of brain distribution</strong>- If you&#x2019;re looking to distribute Scot similar to Steem then your options are Scotbot or wait for SMTs!  We will support SMTs too, but they don&#x2019;t exist yet.  So, if you want to start now Scotbot is your only option.</p>
<p>Scotbot is a python voting bot that holger80 built that utilizes design specs of the SMT white paper.  It&#x2019;s kinda like a really pimped out version of the postpromoter bidbots.  Scotbot is not an SMT.  It doesn&#x2019;t even live on the Steem blockchain.  It&#x2019;s on a separate server running python code to distribute Scot in a way similar to what&#x2019;s described for SMTs in the SMT whitepaper.</p>
<p>The bad news is that it costs 1000ENG to setup (~$200-350 on the market), and costs 1eng/active user every month to maintain.</p>
<p>The good news is that if you combine this with things like an ICO and/or you can monetize your content then you should be able to make more money than what you spend for the distribution service.  Additionally, as we automate we expect prices to come down, but for now there&#x2019;s still a fair amount of manual work that goes into this and we need this to operate as a profitable business or risk failing.</p>
<h2 id="Steps-for-Scotbot"><a href="#Steps-for-Scotbot" class="headerlink" title="Steps for Scotbot"></a>Steps for Scotbot</h2><p>If you&#x2019;re using Scotbot you have to issue tokens, users stake them, then start posting with a special tag that you coded in the settings when you initialized Scotbot.  </p>
<p>From then on any post on steemit.com, busy, steempeak, cryptoempirebot or others will reward posts with your token as long as voters have the token staked (and assuming your community is up to date on payment or the bot will auto shutoff).</p>
<p>If a user is a Steem whale and a Scot whale then you&#x2019;re gonna be a happy camper.  You&#x2019;ll be able to claim rewards in both Steem and Scot.  We&#x2019;re going to allow Steem +2 Scot to get claimed on any given post.  So, yeah, you can double/triple dip on the same content.</p>
<p><strong>Scotbot settings</strong> - I&#x2019;m not gonna lie.  There&#x2019;s a lot of options setting up Scotbot and if you&#x2019;re not techy or math inclined I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s pretty daunting.  If you have a sense of how you want it to operate, but you&#x2019;re unsure of the best settings message me or post in general in the Steem-Engine Discord.  Me or someone in there should be able to help you figure it out.  The official announcements section has the posts to read through to figure out how to set it up.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you can reconfigure settings if you screw up or want to change it, but we do make people burn 100 ENG whenever the account owner alters them.  We want to enable people to alter the settings, but also discourage people with an active community from changing the settings frequently.  It&#x2019;s a bad user experience if you invest and suddenly the rules change.  It&#x2019;s pretty likely that as communities grow larger we&#x2019;ll have a burn cost for making changes that grows with community size.</p>
<h1 id="New-Service-Offering-Nitrous"><a href="#New-Service-Offering-Nitrous" class="headerlink" title="New Service Offering: Nitrous"></a>New Service Offering: Nitrous</h1><p><strong>Nitrous</strong>- Nitrous is your own custom website for your own custom coin with it&#x2019;s own custom distribution!</p>
<p>Nitrous is a brand new service that you can get after you&#x2019;ve created your Scot and setup Scotbot.  I had described it as a vision before and we just launched the prototype for it.  We know more changes are necessary, but we work with the theory of make it live and iterate rather than make it perfect before launch!</p>
<p>We (eonwarped) cloned the github repository (the code) for steemit.com and then started making changes.  We added in keychain, customized images and colors, and reconfigured how the promotional tabs will work (they&#x2019;ll be more useful).  Now we&#x2019;re already integrating custom Steem Engine tokens so post rewards show up as tokens earned rather than Steem earned.  </p>
<p>We&#x2019;re debating whether we open source or close source this.  For now it&#x2019;s close sourced, but we are actively considering if we want to go a different way in the future (can start closed and go open, but it&#x2019;s harder to go the other way).</p>
<p>Nitrous completes the picture of how you deliver tokens.  Create them, configure scotbot, and see them displayed on your own site.</p>
<h1 id="Nitrous-Costs"><a href="#Nitrous-Costs" class="headerlink" title="Nitrous Costs"></a>Nitrous Costs</h1><p>Nitrous will cost $200 to setup and cost $50/month.  It will be charged and collected through steem-engine.com.  For now it&#x2019;s manual, but we should have it up and running in the next week or two.</p>
<h2 id="Sinks"><a href="#Sinks" class="headerlink" title="Sinks"></a>Sinks</h2><p>Currencies require faucets and sinks.  Scotbot and Nitrous cover how to distribute them (the faucet).  Nitrous can also be used as a sink, which is why it&#x2019;s so critical!</p>
<p>Generally speaking distribution is only 10% of the problem.  The real value and the real challenge comes from the sinks for the currency.  Why does someone want to hold your Scot?  What gives it value?  Why should someone buy it?  The answer to those questions are heavily influenced by &#x201C;what is the token good for?&#x201D; or &#x201C;what is the sink?&#x201D;  even better &#x201C;what is the sink for this currency that I can&#x2019;t get anywhere else?&#x201D;</p>
<h2 id="Ad-revenue-and-post-promotion"><a href="#Ad-revenue-and-post-promotion" class="headerlink" title="Ad revenue and post promotion"></a>Ad revenue and post promotion</h2><p>So, our next step is to focus sinks for the token, and our first step is to focus on generating revenue for everyone that operates Nitrous.  By the time we&#x2019;re through you should be making much more money on your site than we&#x2019;re charging you.  </p>
<p>To start we&#x2019;re currently reconfiguring how the promotional tab works and we&#x2019;re in early stages of rolling out an ad service.</p>
<p>The short term ad service will likely just be adsense or something like it that can be plugged into your site.  The longer term picture will require building a crypto ad service.  </p>
<p>A few months down the line we&#x2019;ll match advertisers looking for sites and sites looking for advertisers together.  We&#x2019;ll take a small cut, and otherwise the plan is to help the entire ecosystem get monetized through advertisement!  The advertiser will pick some keywords and be able to float through 10k different custom communities to deliver their ads to their perfect target audience.  The site operators will be able to focus on content generation and not have to track down individual advertisers all day long.</p>
<p>If it&#x2019;s all working it&#x2019;ll be conventient for everyone and a great place for advertisers to get attention and site operators to get money.  What you do with that money will be up to you.  </p>
<h2 id="Community-Token-Distribution-Decisions"><a href="#Community-Token-Distribution-Decisions" class="headerlink" title="Community Token Distribution Decisions"></a>Community Token Distribution Decisions</h2><p>You&#x2019;ll want to figure out how you&#x2019;re going to distribute your community token.  You will likely want to start with an ICO or an Airdrop.  The ICO starter is a feature we&#x2019;re working on.  The airdrop already exists on the site through the launch tab.  These are two examples of how to get your token in the hands of users (who then need to stake them in order for scotbot to use those tokens for voting calculations).</p>
<h2 id="Ongoing-Distribution"><a href="#Ongoing-Distribution" class="headerlink" title="Ongoing Distribution"></a>Ongoing Distribution</h2><p>Once your tokens are distributed you&#x2019;re going to want to figure out ongoing distribution.  You may have a few roles that earn your token (like a moderator).  You may also want to reward people that delegate to your primary steem account.  We&#x2019;ll be working on tools and scripts that make ongoing distribution possible and simple.</p>
<h2 id="I-know-this-is-a-lot"><a href="#I-know-this-is-a-lot" class="headerlink" title="I know this is a lot"></a>I know this is a lot</h2><p>I&#x2019;m a flawed human and I over communicate.  I nerd out and I really like this stuff.  I want you to understand it so that you can make good decisions.  Hopefully you have a sense now of what it&#x2019;ll cost to operate, but also how you&#x2019;ll be able to make money back if you&#x2019;re successful.  </p>
<p>I think this will literally usher in a whole new era for steem where thousands of Scot are powered by Scotbot and fueled Nitrous.  Should be fun and I hope you come along for the ride.</p>
<p>On the off chance you didn&#x2019;t immediately absorb all that and still have questions: <a href="https://discord.gg/YhSuY6Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/YhSuY6Y</a></p>
<p>I think as more examples come into the world it&#x2019;ll be easier to see how this whole thing will work.  Maybe you&#x2019;ll be one of them.</p>

<p>Powered by steem-engine.com, check.  Using Scotbot, check.  First custom website, check.  Keychain integrated, check.  Awesomeness, check.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s got everything you might want as a new PoB distribution token.  Please welcome our first operator to the ecosystem, thanks to @richardcrill for signing up with us, trusting us with a key, putting up with a few little bugs, and helping us get the first scotbot and custom site live.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the steem-engine.com wizards.  </p>
<h2 id="The-number-one-problem-with-Steem-Distribution"><a href="#The-number-one-problem-with-Steem-Distribution" class="headerlink" title="The number one problem with Steem: Distribution"></a>The number one problem with Steem: Distribution</h2><p>I&#x2019;ve said since I got here that the distribution is broken.  I figured that out in like 3 weeks of being here.  It leads to a lot of badness on the platform.  It doesn&#x2019;t help that the whales have lost basically all patience with the platform and are selling off.  </p>
<h1 id="Custom-Websites"><a href="#Custom-Websites" class="headerlink" title="Custom Websites!"></a>Custom Websites!</h1><p>What if you could start Steem over, but not have to deal with a lot of technical details?  What if you could start with a brand new distribution with a different system for how PoB works?  What if you could be the whales and do this whole thing different?  What if you could monetize your site with advertising and post promotion?</p>
<p>All of that is possible thanks to steem-engine ecosystem!  We can get you a token, distribute it, set it up on it&#x2019;s own custom website, and get your own PoB up and running.  We&#x2019;re working on different types of advertising already, but the goal is for the cost of the service to be exceeded by the ad revenue brought in!</p>
<h2 id="Start-your-own-ecosystem-today"><a href="#Start-your-own-ecosystem-today" class="headerlink" title="Start your own ecosystem today!"></a>Start your own ecosystem today!</h2><p>Don&#x2019;t get left in the dust.  If you got a community it&#x2019;s time to monetize it and help all the contributors get in on the action.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.weedcash.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.weedcash.network</a></p>
<p>And you&#x2019;ll see, it looks like steemit.com, but with customizations (some are still in the works).  You&#x2019;ll also notice it already works with keychain, and we&#x2019;ll be bringing a number of other advancements to the site especially around how communities can get their own post promotion and advertising incentives booming!</p>
<h2 id="Edit"><a href="#Edit" class="headerlink" title="Edit"></a>Edit</h2><p>This post right now is only making .4 steem, but it&#x2019;s got 1000+ weedcash in rewards!  You can&#x2019;t see that on steem.  Be sure to write some posts about weed, consider buying and staking some weedcash, and of course remember to use the weedcash tag on appropriate posts!</p>
