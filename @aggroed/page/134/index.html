<p>OK, first off, @swelker101 is on the radio right now with his lovely lady friend @isaria!  You should tune in for the second half of his show and check out his cleverness.  <a href="http://mspwaves.com/home/listen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://mspwaves.com/home/listen/</a></p>
<p>Second off I&#x2019;m going live after @swelker101.  Gonna play a mix of music and talk about Steemit and the direction of the Minnow Support Project.  We&#x2019;re recruiting channel mods, general mods, and working on a variety of projects!</p>
<h2 id="Speaking-of-Projects-MSPL"><a href="#Speaking-of-Projects-MSPL" class="headerlink" title="Speaking of Projects- MSPL "></a>Speaking of Projects- MSPL </h2><h2></h2><p>That&#x2019;s right.  So, I saw this great post by @justinw and it really got me thinking.  </p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/steemdev/@justinw/how-easy-it-is-to-develop-steem-blockchain-apps-with-video-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/steemdev/@justinw/how-easy-it-is-to-develop-steem-blockchain-apps-with-video-tutorial</a></p>
<p>What if we could build a library to help everyone on Steemit learn to code?  Or learn English?  Or learn whatever?  Generally speaking here&#x2019;s how it could work.  You make a post on Steemit.  Possibly include a video from dtube, youtube, or vimeo.  Then you send it our way.  And we put it in the archives.  You get paid, you get views, you build your rep, and then we host it in a place where it&#x2019;s likely to catch post rewards and followers even after you&#x2019;re done!!!</p>
<p>How can we do this?</p>
<h2 id="Steemshelves-com"><a href="#Steemshelves-com" class="headerlink" title="Steemshelves.com "></a>Steemshelves.com </h2><h2></h2><p>A little while back I wanted a place to put all of my serialized posts.  I&#x2019;ve been telling folks since day one you have to serialize posts so that people that like the content will come back.  Just stick with a few things you&#x2019;re intersted in and other folks that like those same things will follow.  That said, I also have a ton of interests on here.  So if you&#x2019;re reading through my blog trying to find Meme the News it&#x2019;s a pain in the ass.  So, I turned to @rhondak and had a conversation with her and before I blinked she had created a website called steemshelves.  Ok, so now you can send her a link and we can archive it in a central location!!!</p>
<p>So, how this work for the library?  Well, you still have to send her a note with a link to the article, but now we can start putting these things into sections in the library.  We&#x2019;re going to start with Steemit programming.  So, that folks that are making tutorial videos on how to make apps and programs for Steemit we can house all of those in one place.  I&#x2019;m spoken to a few people and here&#x2019;s a partial list of stand outs below.</p>
<p>@heimindanger<br>@justinw<br>@ausbitbank<br>@blueorgy<br>@sircork<br>@martibis<br>@inertia<br>@netuoso<br>@r0nd0n</p>
<h2 id="What-to-do"><a href="#What-to-do" class="headerlink" title="What to do?  "></a>What to do?  </h2><h2></h2><p>Tag your post with #mspl and after you author it send the url in a transfer note to @rhondak.  Please include which language you&#x2019;re using and a general sense of the challenge level: start-here, novice, intermediate, or advanced level.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;re going to start with programming and then find another active and/or active community and start storing things in the library, but programming seems the most immement need for Steemit, so let&#x2019;s start there?</p>
<h2 id="What-are-the-benefits"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits? "></a>What are the benefits? </h2><h2></h2><p>Well, the community will have a library of posts stored in a central archive folks can put into.  If you&#x2019;re authoring you&#x2019;ll get your  own post, your own reward, and then we&#x2019;ll archive.  So, we&#x2019;re not taking anything from you.  We&#x2019;re just adding a service.  To start this @minnowsupport will cover the cost of labor for @rhondak to shelve things.  So, literally it will only cost you the 0.001sbd to add your work to the central library found at steemshelves.com and I made the account @mspl which may eventually get used.</p>

<h2 id="Vision"><a href="#Vision" class="headerlink" title="Vision "></a>Vision </h2><h2></h2><p>MSP is a big town or small city, and we&#x2019;re growing.  We&#x2019;re going to grow faster because @timcliff got us on the welcome page with his latest pull request.  Cities need to offer services.  We started with bot to allow us community accounts.  We added a webpage.  We created a radio station with mspwaves.com.  Now we&#x2019;re adding a library.  We&#x2019;ll get a school eventually.  All your government services that you could ever want, free to use, and completely open to the public.  That&#x2019;s where we&#x2019;re headed!  Come join us.  If you don&#x2019;t have the time to work with us, but want to support what we&#x2019;re doing please delegate some Steem Power to our various projects!</p>

<p>We&#x2019;ve met Shane (@swelker101) and we&#x2019;ve met @gmuxx.  Let&#x2019;s go say hello to @sammosk!  The creator and key holder for msp-creativebot.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;ve hung out in the Minnow Support Project for a while you might see that people Level Up every so often.  We have a variety of pre-programmed Discord Bots in there.  Tatsumaki is one of them.  Tat keeps a log of how much people are talking in the channels in PALnet for us.  Every 20 sec or so it will award some points if you&#x2019;re typing in a channel.  Sammo is clearly in the lead on the top typer charts.  So, if there is anyone you&#x2019;ve met in PAL it&#x2019;s probably him!</p>

<p>In my last delegation post I put up a poetry contest.  I shouldn&#x2019;t have done that.  I&#x2019;m no judge of poetry.  You&#x2019;re feelings are what your feelings are.  You&#x2019;re writing and passion is yours.  How can I judge that?  Did you solve a problem correctly?  Sure I&#x2019;ll grade that.  You wrote some fiction&#x2026; does it make any sense?  Sure I can judge that.  Poetry?  Poetry?  The subtle lines of context bleeding from you heart to page and dripping fresh hurt into my eyes&#x2026; and you want me to judge that?  No way.  So I&#x2019;m cheating&#x2026; and it&#x2019;s good news for you.  For those that made a poem I&#x2019;m just gonna delegate 100SP.  Everyone get&#x2019;s 100 SP delegated to them directly except @sammo, who had asked that I delegate his winnings to @msp-creativebot to help spread the wealth.</p>
<p>He&#x2019;s a good dude!</p>
<p>Ok, here&#x2019;s what I dun did!</p>
<p>Delegated an extra 100 SP to msp-creativebot in honor of @sammosk and his winning poem.<br>Delegated 100 Sp to @an0nkn0wledge<br>Delegated an additional 100 to @geke<br>Delegated 100SP to @isaria<br>Delegated 100 SP to @lordmok<br>Delegated 100 SP to @arbitrarykitten<br>Delegated 100 SP to @himshweta<br>Delegated 100 SP to @thepotato<br>Delegated 100 SP to @isohero</p>

This is in part because many people on Steemit are currently deep in the Vietmeme war doing the best we can to show the idiocy, kleptography, insanity of what government does on a daily basis.  I want to make a meme the news post that&#x2019;s filled with minnow memes.  There&#x2019;s 500SP up for grabs minimum.  I reserve the right to double it.  Anything you post will be used in an upcoming Meme the News Post and you&#x2019;ll get credit for them.  Best meme(s) will be delegated at least 500SP, but I&#x2019;m willing to increase if there are some really good ones.</p>

<p>Boom!  5k followers.  I was self-proclaimed Steemit famous at 4k followers.  Now I&#x2019;m Steemit famousXL!  Boom!  It&#x2019;s a good day.  Actually, it&#x2019;s pretty exciting to me.  Lots of good shit.  MSPWaves is about to hit 5k views.  We hit 5k accounts in Discord (and almost immediately after scrubbed inactives down to 4200+).  Tim Cliff&#x2019;s condensor pull request got approved so the Minnow Support Project is gonna be on the front lines welcoming new minnows.  (Frankly, I&#x2019;m a little scared of that, but here we GOOOOO!)  I got word that a few communities are going to move into MSP and have us house them, and a program to help with that transition should be ready this weekend.  So, I&#x2019;m feeling pretty great, and that makes me want to help other people!</p>

<p>Hello Steemians,</p>
<p>I wanted to take a moment to broadly categorize 4 different types of bots that run on Steemit.  You&#x2019;ve seen these things interacting with people and the chain everyday, and I just wanted to give a good sense of what they do and categorize them to help you understand their role on Steemit.</p>
<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-a-bot"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-a-bot" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s a bot "></a>What&#x2019;s a bot </h2><h2></h2><p>A bot is an account that has an aspect of programming built into it.  There&#x2019;s usually a program or some kind of interface that allows for things that happen daily or weekly to be done automatically by computer rather than done manually.</p>
<h2 id="Bid-Bot"><a href="#Bid-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Bid Bot "></a>Bid Bot </h2><h2></h2><p>The first kind of bot that most people would refer too I think would be a bid bot or a vote bot.  These are pay2play (pay2spray in 1 case).  You send SBD and a post URL in the memo and you can get a vote.  They almost always net you more than you invested though there are times that the cost of the bid outweighs the rewards you earn.  Most of them are using the Dr. Otto build by @inertia, but there&#x2019;s one prominent one out there that isn&#x2019;t.</p>
<p>Dr. Ottos- @booster, @bellyrub, @nettybot, @discordia, and @lovejuice are all examples of bidbots that run the Dr. Otto program.</p>
<p>Others- @minnowbooster and @randowhale are examples of bots that run a different system.  Randowhale gives you a random percent boost.  @minnowbooster isn&#x2019;t quite a bid so much as a cash for immediate vote thing.  @minnowbooster also has delegation rental so there are additional features there to explore.</p>
<h2 id="Infobot"><a href="#Infobot" class="headerlink" title="Infobot "></a>Infobot </h2><h2></h2><p>There are a few bots that provide you with information on a daily basis.  @curie&#x2019;s post are a good info one.  While the manual action that they are really known for is curation there is a script that aggregates the posts they rewarded together and a list of the posts they supported is reported.  That&#x2019;s info!  You can also see @arcange has a daily hit parade bot that scours the block for the most voted and most commented posts and puts those together so folks can see what&#x2019;s hot.  You get info.  </p>
<h2 id="Curation"><a href="#Curation" class="headerlink" title="Curation "></a>Curation </h2><h2></h2><p>Auto: There are bots that are out there that help with curation.  At their worst they create circle jerks that drain the pool.  At their best they create mechanisms to fund authors who post great content.  Basically any account can become a curation bot just by adding steemvoter or autovoting programs on top.  There are some opensource programs that allow for steem voting so you can pay for the steemvoter service or run your own.  A great example of these can be found in the Minnow Support Project with @msp-creativebot, @muxxybot, and @sft.  These are examples of bots that form specifically to help find and curate great content.</p>
<p>Cyborg:  there are at least two examples of cyborg curation.  Cyborg is a mix of person and machine.  In this case @banjo and @minnowsupport are good examples (both programs were created by @inertia).  They have community accounts that they attach to, but each vote is cast manually.  So, the program allows people to use a communal account without the posting key, but every individual vote is cast manually by a person.  So, they are cyborgs.</p>
<h2 id="Community"><a href="#Community" class="headerlink" title="Community "></a>Community </h2><h2></h2><p>The last kind of bot functions similarly to the curation bots, but the focus is less on great content and more on a community of authors and Steemit contributors.  msp-lovebot, and @msp-shanehugs are good examples here.  Folks that contribute to the community are rewarded with upvotes on their posts.  Some of it is because they delegate to projects, some of it is because they work hard and contribute to the group.</p>
<h2 id="MSP-A-community-hub-for-communities"><a href="#MSP-A-community-hub-for-communities" class="headerlink" title="MSP: A community hub for communities "></a>MSP: A community hub for communities </h2><h2></h2><p>In the coming weeks the Minnow Support Project is going to work with a variety of communities to financially support them as get started.  There are blossoming African, Filipino, and Turkish communities to name a few, but there are a variety of concerns around them.  One of the roles that the Minnow Support Project can play is to foster communities by acting as a neutral 3rd party with crystal clear guidelines and a track record of success and managed by trustworthy and publicly accountable elected Witnesses.  We are also building tools to help automate aspects of this.  When we&#x2019;re done we&#x2019;ll have the ability to automate this stuff and make it a breeze!</p>
<h2 id="Be-the-curation-you-want-to-see-in-the-world"><a href="#Be-the-curation-you-want-to-see-in-the-world" class="headerlink" title="Be the curation you want to see in the world "></a>Be the curation you want to see in the world </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;ll make a bigger rant about this later, but ultimately people (whales) really need to be the curation they want to see in this world.  Essentially you have 2 choices.  Support content and or support people.  The Minnow Support Project does both and tries to lead by example of what good community and content curation can look like as a team project.</p>
<h2 id="Yes-I&#x2019;m-going-here"><a href="#Yes-I&#x2019;m-going-here" class="headerlink" title="Yes, I&#x2019;m going here "></a>Yes, I&#x2019;m going here </h2><h2></h2><p>We do good shit!  Please support us!</p>

<p>And I hope this gives you some additional idea of what bots can do to help Steemit, you, content creators, and communities!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Generally in the United States there is a tradition of gifting pies for new neighbors, but the tradition doesn&#x2019;t work the same way everywhere.  In particular in the MidWest it is frequent that the neighbors in the neighborhood will bake you a pie and welcome you to the neighborhood.  In New England the tradition is more likely that you bake a pie and give it to your neighbors.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m not entirely sure why there are the differences&#x2026; I think the midwest may be more hungry for growth and so they welcome people into their community with open arms and try to keep the people that come.  New England is already fairly dense by American standards and so we&#x2019;re kind happy if people just gtfo, but if they come bearing pies maybe we&#x2019;ll love them.</p>
<h2 id="Which-kind-of-place-is-Steemit"><a href="#Which-kind-of-place-is-Steemit" class="headerlink" title="Which kind of place is Steemit? "></a>Which kind of place is Steemit? </h2><h2></h2><p>Tough news for newbies&#x2026; you gotta bake the pie.  You have to bring it to your neighbor, and you have to earn their trust and love.  Steemit wants growth, but Steemians don&#x2019;t really want a bunch of spammy fucks begging for upvotes and follows either.  We want contributors that will make the network better, stronger, more robust, and offer more things to more people.  We don&#x2019;t want a million handouts&#x2026;  So, if you&#x2019;re going to come here, and you want to get noticed you have to bake a pie.</p>

I can&#x2019;t bake a pie "></a>But Aggroed, this is a digital space.  I can&#x2019;t bake a pie </h2><h2></h2><p>No, you can&#x2019;t, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean you can&#x2019;t approach people with a gift or offering.  So, rather than starting with a &#x201C;Hey, will you follow me?&#x201D;  Why don&#x2019;t you start with a &#x201C;Hey, look what I can do for you?&#x201D;</p>
<h2 id="2-recent-examples"><a href="#2-recent-examples" class="headerlink" title="2 recent examples "></a>2 recent examples </h2><h2></h2><p>@diego messages me on steemit.chat.  Most of the time when new people message me it&#x2019;s not the message I want.  No I dont&#x2019; want to follow you.  No I don&#x2019;t need another lion picture article.  No, I don&#x2019;t want to upvote your contest.  No I don&#x2019;t&#x2026;.  blah blah blah.</p>
<p>ok, but this kid comes and says, &#x201C;Hey, I&#x2019;m new here, and I make EDM music, I&#x2019;d like to share it with this community, can you help introduce me to it?&#x201D;  I don&#x2019;t know how he got my name.  I dont&#x2019; know how he knows I like EDM, but here we are.  Rather than ignoring him or telling him to get off my lawn I resteemed his intro.  I told him to make me some Dubstep, and offered him an MSP waves radio DJ spot.  We could use someone on the 1s and 2s so to speak.  We&#x2019;ll see where it goes.  But he says he offers EDM pies, and that was close enough for me as a minnow lover.</p>
<h2 id="Example-2"><a href="#Example-2" class="headerlink" title="Example 2 "></a>Example 2 </h2><h2></h2><p>@andren just made me a cover art.  I hadn&#x2019;t had one before.  Now I do.  Now I&#x2019;m introducing this graphic artist to nearly 5,000 people who will hopefully follow him, possibly ask him for art, and help him build a community.  He offered me a pie.  I resteemed his stuff.  That&#x2019;s how this community can work.  It cost him a bit of time to make me a cover art.  It cost me over a year to build a community that I have, but at this point it&#x2019;s free to talk about him and get him exposure for his work.  </p>
<p>Quid Pro Quo?  Equivalent Exchange?  Pie for Pie?  IDK what you wanna call it.  But that&#x2019;s just good business.  He gets an audience and I get a banner.</p>
<h2 id="Moral-of-the-story"><a href="#Moral-of-the-story" class="headerlink" title="Moral of the story "></a>Moral of the story </h2><h2></h2><p>If you&#x2019;re the little guy on here, and you want to make a name for yourself or build a community.  Make people pies.</p>
<h2 id="MSP-Waves"><a href="#MSP-Waves" class="headerlink" title="MSP Waves "></a>MSP Waves </h2><h2></h2><p>Quick plug for @crimsonclad.  She had the highest attended show last week with her heavy metal business FULL FORCE THURSDAY.  Should be a stellar showing again tonight.  You won&#x2019;t want to miss it.</p>
<h2 id="Delegation-request"><a href="#Delegation-request" class="headerlink" title="Delegation request "></a>Delegation request </h2><h2></h2><p>Day one we got around 16-17k in Delegations on @minnowsupport.  We&#x2019;re driving for another 84k or so.  Please consider delegating just a few thousand SP if you have it.  We are basically a volunteer army helping to train and retain minnows on the platform.  If you think that&#x2019;s a service worth having than please delegate to @minnowsupport.</p>
