<p>So, I&#x2019;ve gone around and contacted a fair number of the biggest names on the platform and I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re going to be disappointed.  We&#x2019;ll have folks from Steemit INC, around a dozen of the top 20 witnesses including @timcliff and @jesta.  We&#x2019;ll have some of the biggest whales on the platform around.  This is the start of a conversation you&#x2019;re not going to want to miss it!</p>
<h2 id="Steem-Growth-Forum"><a href="#Steem-Growth-Forum" class="headerlink" title="Steem Growth Forum "></a>Steem Growth Forum </h2><h2></h2><p>This is a chance to gather some of the most influential people on the platform, get them into a virtual room together, and start the discussion of how we are going to grow the ecosystem.  The world is a little broken and many of us here know that the Steem platform can address an incredible number of issues.  We know HF20 Velocity and SMTs are coming and those innovations can elevate the Steem platform from one of the best platforms to the single best platform to spend your attention on.  </p>
<p>Come have this discussion.  If you&#x2019;re a whale, a Steemit employee, a top 30 witness, a follower whale or host a large Discord community we&#x2019;re happy to have you come on the live broadcast.  If you&#x2019;re not one of those you&#x2019;re welcome to join us the Discord chatroom and type in questions, pose questions, or submit some ideas.  Those interactions are recorded too.</p>
<h2 id="Format"><a href="#Format" class="headerlink" title="Format "></a>Format </h2><h2></h2><p>We&#x2019;ll take a quick poll at the beginning of the show and see who wants to start us off (looking at you @andrarchy).  Folks that want to speak will enter a 1 in chat.  They&#x2019;ll get logged in order on a spreadsheet.  We&#x2019;ll go through the spreadsheet and talk to some folks.  I&#x2019;ll have a 5 min timer and let people go.  After the first round we&#x2019;ll collect names again and potentially expand the participation rules depending on who is there and who else wants to speak.  If there are some members that don&#x2019;t meet the requirements I&#x2019;ll work on hosting another meeting later for them.</p>
<h2 id="Voice-chat-needs"><a href="#Voice-chat-needs" class="headerlink" title="Voice chat needs"></a>Voice chat needs</h2><h2></h2><p>Make sure you have a headset and mic.<br>Show up a little before the start to test your mic and headset. We have some waiting room voice channels that are good for testing.</p>
<h2 id="Community-Standards-and-Rules"><a href="#Community-Standards-and-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Community Standards and Rules "></a>Community Standards and Rules </h2><h2></h2><p>These will be in effect during the broadcast.  If you can&#x2019;t abide by some fairly simple rules you&#x2019;ll be shown the door.  This isn&#x2019;t a forum for you to flame.  If you have some constructive criticisms they&#x2019;ll be welcome.  If you&#x2019;re there to target people or Steemit don&#x2019;t expect to last long.</p>
<p>You can find the basics of what you need to know about our community here: <a href="https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Logistics"><a href="#Logistics" class="headerlink" title="Logistics"></a>Logistics</h2><h2></h2><p>The Moderated discussion will take place at 11AM EST (this is NYC time) Saturday November 18. This I believe is 16:00 UTC time. I will moderate the discussion.</p>
<p>It will take place in the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network Discord channel: <a href="https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/dpGVBcy</a></p>
<p>The Minnow Support Project has created a streaming internet radio station called mspwaves. We&#x2019;ll broadcast the event live and save a recording for the block later.</p>
<p>Typed in questions and discussion by the audience will happen here: <a href="https://discord.gg/BS8WTzM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/BS8WTzM</a><br>You can listen to the show in the PALnet discord room here: <a href="https://discord.gg/pGHjVtc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/pGHjVtc</a><br>You can listen to the show live on air at mspwaves.com/listen.</p>

We&#x2019;re growing.  We grew the platform around 2% just last week.  There&#x2019;s more to do and we&#x2019;re going to meet and figure out what we want to prioritize as a community.  I&#x2019;ll extend this conversation out to other groups as well (just like I mentioned in Witness Chat in Steemit.chat).  This is just the starting point.  Come join us and lend your voice to the chorus and be an active participant in the forum and in the growth of a remarkable platform.</p>

<p>This may not be the sexiest post ever, but I was doing a test.  Today I got the second of my 3 answers to my test.  The test was regarding paywithsteem.</p>

<h2 id="Test-2"><a href="#Test-2" class="headerlink" title="Test 2 "></a>Test 2 </h2><h2></h2><p>Amazon gift card.  It was instant for the egift card.  I was the dutiful crypto enthusiast husband and simply gave the access to muh wife.  She&#x2019;s bought some <del>shit</del> household items with it already.  </p>
<h2 id="Test-3"><a href="#Test-3" class="headerlink" title="Test 3 "></a>Test 3 </h2><h2></h2><p>Puffs Plus.  I wanted to test their Amazon Wishlist service.  It came today.  It was slightly more expensive than just doing it straight through amazon, but now I have a very convenient way to turn crypto into household items.  If I&#x2019;m being fully honest I was preparing an unboxxing video for this, but my 5 year old opened the box before I even got home. (<em>&amp;^(</em>&amp;%&amp;%^$&amp;^%<em>&amp;^(</em>&amp;^</p>

I needed a way to spend crypto to get physical home goods to settle some waggro.  Within days of me wishing it was here it was already up and running.  We have an incredibly passionate group of talented people who spend hours making programs and colorful content for the Steem ecosystem.  Specifically on on top of that now is a gateway to Amazon direct from Steem.  This is a great thing for the platform and I&#x2019;m encouraging you to use it.</p>

<p>Growing up my Dad earned a sailboat.  He threatened to leave a job and they wanted him to stay enough they literally bought him this boat.  It&#x2019;s about 15 feet long.  It has a fiberglass shell.  It&#x2019;s tippy as hell.  And on a strong breeze it feels like freedom.  I led wilderness trips up in Maine for a few summers.  One of my favorite trips was a 10-day sailing trip along the coast of Maine.  We took a few 20-30&#x2019; boats out with a whole bunch of kids from a summer camp.  I was the counselor.  It was pretty incredible and a remarkable learning experience.  Later I became a professor at a Maritime College.  I taught students that showed up in uniform and said &#x201C;Yes Sir.&#x201D;  They would become army kids, navy kids, marines,  coasties, and merchant marines.  I can&#x2019;t live too far from lakes or oceans or spend too long without them.  I get homesick.</p>
<p>One of my favorite poems is now released to the world free from copyright stuff.  It&#x2019;s called Sea Fever.  It&#x2019;s by John Masefield.</p>
<h2 id="Sea-Fever"><a href="#Sea-Fever" class="headerlink" title="Sea Fever "></a>Sea Fever </h2><h2></h2><blockquote>
<p>I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,<br>And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by,<br>And the wheel&#x2019;s kick and the wind&#x2019;s song and the white sail&#x2019;s shaking,<br>And a grey mist on the sea&#x2019;s face, and a grey dawn breaking.</p>
<p>I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide<br>Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;<br>And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,<br>And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.</p>
<p>I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,<br>To the gull&#x2019;s way and the whale&#x2019;s way, where the wind&#x2019;s like a whetted knife;<br>And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,<br>And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick&#x2019;s over.</p>
</blockquote>

One of the moderators reminded us &#x201C;don&#x2019;t forget why you&#x2019;re there.&#x201D;  I then had a random comment on my witness post some 5 months after I released it.  It made me go back and look at what I had written.</p>
<h2 id="Aggroed&#x2019;s-Witness-Announcement"><a href="#Aggroed&#x2019;s-Witness-Announcement" class="headerlink" title="Aggroed&#x2019;s Witness Announcement "></a>Aggroed&#x2019;s Witness Announcement </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m so happy and excited to get to launch this campaign. Together we can work on growing this community and helping the newest members become successful. We all want this site and platform to grow so that it&#x2019;s message can resonate across the internet and make an impact in your daily life. I value Peace, Abundance, and Liberty and with your help; others who share those values and learn those values will come here and stay here!</p>
<p>The world is run by immoral banksters that cause us all harm. Through spreading technology that loosens their monopoly on money creation we free ourselves from their shackles. It&#x2019;s imperative that we work together to spread Steemit to others and help this platform grow. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ll dedicate my time, energy, and focus as a Witness to the growth of Steemit!</p>
<p>For many on the Witness list they see this role as programming new apps and widgets that give new features to the product. It&#x2019;s a wonderful contribution. This platform wouldn&#x2019;t be where it is today without it. However, at it&#x2019;s current stage and size the Steemit platform has evolved enough so that one new feature or tweak to the platform isn&#x2019;t going to cause a mass migration here. We&#x2019;re not limited by the tools at hand, but by the number of people who know how to wield them and why they should.</p>
<p>This platform&#x2019;s message will spread by rallying our community around new people, showing them the ropes, and rewarding their success. It will grow by reaching out person by person to bring new members into the community. They will stay if they can find a way to start with nothing, connect with others, and grow their audience and their accounts.</p>
<p>The next stage of Steemit rests in the hands of educators, sales and marketing, and our community outreach. As a teacher, as an educator, as a communicator, as an activist, and as a passionate advocate for Steemit I know we can spread our message and our platform. I know if we do that then we can build a better world.</p>
<p>For those that can envision a better world filled with Peace, Abundance, and Liberty I ask that you upvote and resteem this post and you vote for me as witness!</p>
<h2 id="I-keep-using-the-sailing-anology"><a href="#I-keep-using-the-sailing-anology" class="headerlink" title="I keep using the sailing anology "></a>I keep using the sailing anology </h2><h2></h2><p>Peace, Abundance, and Liberty to you are mostly like nouns describing things.  To me they are verbs and headings.  Peace isn&#x2019;t a static thing.  It&#x2019;s something in motion and constantly flowing.  The rules of what&#x2019;s peaceful behavior shift as circumstances shift.  It&#x2019;s the same with abundance and liberty.  In my mind 5 months and 15 days ago when I set my witness campaign on a heading of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty I didn&#x2019;t know what I was getting into.  I didn&#x2019;t know I&#x2019;d have a 5,000 person Discord server within a month or two.  I didn&#x2019;t know that this platform would elevate me to a top witness.  I had no idea I&#x2019;d work this hard to fashion a digital home in this ecosystem.</p>
<p>And as I think about what did I promise to do?  What am I doing?  What was my course? I&#x2019;m actually pretty proud.  It&#x2019;s like a glowing hot ember in my chest.  It&#x2019;s like the feeling I had when I graduated with my chemistry degree.  It&#x2019;s like the first time my daughter was able to say the words &#x201C;I love you dad.&#x201D;  It&#x2019;s a mix of contentment and pride in what I&#x2019;ve done.  </p>
<p>This hasn&#x2019;t been an easy ride.  Not only have I worked as hard or harder than ever before in my life as I juggle two young children, a marriage with ups and downs, a full time job where I&#x2019;m hiring a team, a witness campaign, and community that I run, but I&#x2019;m also talking about the trip I took to get here.  I don&#x2019;t believe what they teach in classes or what the anchor man says anymore.  I&#x2019;ve lost my faith in this government and recognize the harm and fraud in the system.  Getting to a point that I could see it, and open my eyes, and unlearn what I had learned took multiple depressions, many years, lost friends, and marital challenges.  It&#x2019;s been a hell of trip to get here, and I&#x2019;m just taking a pause to say: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m staying the course, I&#x2019;m doing what I set out to do, and I&#x2019;m grateful to this community for supporting me on the way to do that.&#x201D;</p>
<h2 id="A-fear"><a href="#A-fear" class="headerlink" title="A fear "></a>A fear </h2><h2></h2><p>My biggest fear is that one day my daughters will know the truth about how harmful this system and it&#x2019;s leaders are, and they will ask me &#x201C;Dad, did you know?  What did you do?&#x201D; and all I can hope is that the answer I provide is enough to satisfy my heart and theirs.  So, it&#x2019;s my ultimate wish to do as my mother said, and leave this world a better place than the one I found, and I&#x2019;ve set my eyes upon a world that&#x2019;s Peaceful, Abundant, and Civil Liberties are paramount.</p>
<h2 id="A-Wish"><a href="#A-Wish" class="headerlink" title="A Wish "></a>A Wish </h2><h2></h2><p>So, when I set out on this course I had a simple and ambitious goal.  I want to change the world.  I don&#x2019;t like what I see.  I don&#x2019;t like the violence.  I don&#x2019;t like that the US government is bombing seven nations.  I don&#x2019;t like the financial wars.  I don&#x2019;t like seeing what our leaders are doing.  I don&#x2019;t like living in a system that guarantees poverty.  The private Federal Reserve bank purposefully manipulates the economy to shuffle wealth from the poor to the rich and the best piece of evidence is in the score board where 8 people have as much wealth as 3.5 billion.  And I can&#x2019;t stand the surveillance state.  I don&#x2019;t want my children groped by TSA agents, or living in fear of using their voice to protest and change what they see.  It&#x2019;s a simple wish, but I want the world to change.</p>
<h2 id="A-Witness"><a href="#A-Witness" class="headerlink" title="A Witness "></a>A Witness </h2><h2></h2><p>As Bad Santa said &#x201C;Wish in one hand and shit in the other and see which fills up faster.&#x201D;  Wishes alone are not enough.  I grew up as a wrestler and honed my body and mind in the gym at a young age.  Across the wall was &#x201C;The desire to fly is not enough.  You must have wings.&#x201D;  So, again I have set my mind and body to the task of altering the world.  Not just wishing it, but setting a heading and doing the tough work to make a different life and teach a different life that I know is possible.  I have to say it&#x2019;s nothing short of a grueling pace I&#x2019;ve set.  There&#x2019;s hardly any time that I get to myself to simply relax, but this world isn&#x2019;t going to unfuck itself.  So, the witness gig to me is my enactment on my desire to see world change, and I&#x2019;m grateful for your support.</p>
<h2 id="A-Whale"><a href="#A-Whale" class="headerlink" title="A Whale "></a>A Whale </h2><h2></h2><p>Last night after almost a year and a half of nearly constant work I hit 50,000 SP.  I&#x2019;m now officially a whale.  I don&#x2019;t much look like a whale because I delegate nearly every SP I have to a variety of projects and accounts that support minnows, but I&#x2019;m a whale nonetheless.  I&#x2019;m going to continue my efforts, my campaign, and my course to spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  Grow the Steem platform, and train and retain minnows on it.</p>
<h2 id="In-the-meantime-before-my-kids-are-old-enough-to-ask-wtf-is-going-on-with-the-world-what-keeps-me-going"><a href="#In-the-meantime-before-my-kids-are-old-enough-to-ask-wtf-is-going-on-with-the-world-what-keeps-me-going" class="headerlink" title="In the meantime, before my kids are old enough to ask wtf is going on with the world, what keeps me going? "></a>In the meantime, before my kids are old enough to ask wtf is going on with the world, what keeps me going? </h2><h2></h2><p>Here&#x2019;s a clip from the Minnow Mayor Town Hall radio show I hold.  It&#x2019;s an open forum where anyone can come on and talk about stuff with me.  Here&#x2019;s @staceyjean.  She&#x2019;s a vet and has some social anxiety and shit she&#x2019;s working on.  I&#x2019;ve been resisting balling my eyes out from this interview for a day or two, but it definately hit me square in the feelz.  The work I&#x2019;m doing is creating a better world for folks to find a slice of peace in.  I just need to keep doing what I&#x2019;m doing, but keep making it bigger one person at a time.</p>
<p>Thanks for you support and thanks for this opportunity.  It&#x2019;s an incredible opportunity to serve.</p>

<p>Every week I have the pleasure of running a radio show on MSPwaves radio.  It&#x2019;s called the Minnow Mayor Town Hall.  Since we&#x2019;re around 5,000 active members helping to run and organize the Minnow Support Project is very much like running a small internet town.  It&#x2019;s fun, and a little crazy at the same time.</p>

(MSP) "></a>What&#x2019;s the Minnow Support Project? (MSP) </h2><h2></h2><p>The Minnow Support Project is a witness project to create a community space to spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, help the Steem platform grow, and train and retain minnows on the platform.</p>
<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-PALnet"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-PALnet" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s PALnet? "></a>What&#x2019;s PALnet? </h2><h2></h2><p>PALnet stands for the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network.  It&#x2019;s a gathering place, internet chatroom, and voice and video conferencing platform where we have assembled 5,000 Steemians (1% of the total platform).  It&#x2019;s the largest Discord group on Steem.</p>

"></a>What&#x2019;s MSPwaves radio? </h2><h2></h2><p>MSP built a streaming internet radio station.  Now we host conversations and music on air so that you can get to meet your fellow Steemians.  We&#x2019;re open to having more radio shows coming.  We&#x2019;re already at 16 DJs and looking to continue expanding.  You can listen in at mspwaves.com/listen.</p>
<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-going-on-tonight"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-going-on-tonight" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s going on tonight? "></a>What&#x2019;s going on tonight? </h2><h2></h2><p>In about 20 min I&#x2019;m going to host a 1 hr Steem and PALnet orientation.  This will run for 1 hr.  I&#x2019;ll share my screen and walk folks through steemit.com, mspsteem.com, and/or gosteem.com.  I&#x2019;ll talk through the various buttons and how to make a good post.</p>

As long as you have a functioning headset and mic you&#x2019;re welcome to come on air and promote yourself or a project, introduce yourself, ask me questions, or just hangout on air and share a poem or something that you&#x2019;re working on.  I do attempt to record these and put them on the block later, but no immediate guarantees.</p>
<h2 id="250SP-Delegation"><a href="#250SP-Delegation" class="headerlink" title="250SP Delegation "></a>250SP Delegation </h2><h2></h2><p>If you come on air you are eligible for a 250 SP delegation.  That starts after the orientation.  Then I&#x2019;ll use a discord bot to roll randomly to see which of the folks that went on the air will win the delegation.  I typically try to leave these delegations on for 6 months.  If you stop being active I reserve to right to shrink or withdraw it.  If you&#x2019;re already a dolphin you can&#x2019;t win it, but you can nominate a MSP-bot or minnow to win.</p>
<h2 id="Dice-Bitches"><a href="#Dice-Bitches" class="headerlink" title="Dice Bitches "></a>Dice Bitches </h2><h2></h2><p>We play a highly rigged game called Dice Bitches.  We use a bot to roll dice using the command <code>t!dice 15d15</code>.  If you tie my roll or beat my roll you get to move onto the next round.  Then we do another roll but using <code>t!dice 14d14</code> and so on until either I win or an audience member wins.  If I win once we&#x2019;ll start over.  If I win twice I&#x2019;ll donate the proceeds of the contest to @msp-waves.</p>

            <p>Ok, so, <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=waggro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">waggro</a> is still in effect here.  I have to show my spouse that I can turn virtual crypto currency into real life goods to help satiate the concern that crypto isn&#x2019;t real.   Now some of you hard core crypto hounds might be a little triggered by that.  I&#x2019;m of the opinion that government fiat isn&#x2019;t real.  They can print as much as they want whenever they want.  It&#x2019;s backed by violence and a system designed to steal wealth from the poor to deliver to the rich.  So, I think the onus is on fiat to show that it&#x2019;s a real currency rather than a giant scam, but that&#x2019;s a tough economic discussion to have with muh wife.  So&#x2026; paywithsteem it is!</p>
<p>To that end I bought a pair of earbuds from paywithsteem not that long ago.  That was a good experience, but the website that they built is a selling a bunch of stuff that I can&#x2019;t really make long term plans off of.  It&#x2019;s watches and hoodies and keyboards.  It&#x2019;s going to take 2 weeks for my earbuds to get here.  I want something a little more immediate.  So, I <del>complained</del> raised my concern that we need something a little more immediate.  </p>
<p>He told me to put together a wish list of stuff that I would want to see sold on the storefront.  He came back and said &#x201C;All this stuff is just from Amazon?  Let&#x2019;s do a wishlist.&#x201D;  I created a short wishlist comprised of Puffs Plus moisturized facial tissues and a $50 Amazon gift card.</p>
<p>Since the script isn&#x2019;t ready we figured out the cost of tissues and giftcards and priced it in steem.  He did a 15% markup (roughly half of this is in btc fees).  Shipping was free as he currently has amazon prime.  I manually sent him a steem transfer and he then purchased puffs plus moisturized facial tissues and the gift card.  He showed me a note from Amazon showing that it had been ordered and a order number.  I then received the egift card a few minutes later.</p>

<p>I guess I&#x2019;m back to say I continue to like this service.  My wife has already applied the Amazon giftcard to her account.  My next plan is to wait a bit for the price of steem to go up and then use some of my liquid steem to purchase more giftcards and let steem pay for some of our household expenses.</p>
