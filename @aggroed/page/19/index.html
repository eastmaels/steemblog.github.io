<p>There seems to be some jostling of Witness votes happening right now.  Apparently, a witness dropping from 1 to 21 is newsworthy enough re:witnesses to get people to revisit their lists.  </p>
<p>It&#x2019;s pretty amazing to be in the consensus witness list without those two votes.  Literally everyone else in there has one of them but me.  The amount of support for me broadly in the community is nothing short of epic!  It&#x2019;s a little terrifying to be sitting at the low end of the consensus witness range again.  Oh well, this community knows how to make things exciting!</p>
<p>Anyway, getting back to work on Steemmonsters.com, steem-engine.com and Stars Align stuff.  That said I&#x2019;m still a little too close for comfort to getting booted out of being a consensus witness still.  So, I&#x2019;m still trying to rally another sizable whale vote or two to secure my position enough where I don&#x2019;t have worry about it all day.  </p>
<p>If you don&#x2019;t vote my witness, but think that the projects and communities I help build increase the value of your stake please consider voting for me.</p>

<p>I didn&#x2019;t have any tears when I lost the Pumpkin vote.  But I had some when I got to be back in the top 20.  I&#x2019;m a big softy.  That said, this is my home and I spend the vast majority of every day 7 days a week doing things to support and grow this community and ecosystem.  So, it hurt when someone that significant dropped my witness, but it&#x2019;s a million times better to see people all over the world come out and support me!  I&#x2019;m so thankful!</p>

Being a top 20 witness right now doesn&#x2019;t provide a ton of income, but it provides enough safety net that I don&#x2019;t have work a 40 hour a week fiat job I hate.  Thanks for a boost back into the top 20 so I can continue to grow the Minnow  Support Project, MSP-Waves, Steem Monsters and now Steem Engine too.</p>
<h2 id="It-came-from-all-over"><a href="#It-came-from-all-over" class="headerlink" title="It came from all over!"></a>It came from all over!</h2><p>USA, Europe, and Korea for the win!</p>
<p>Thanks to people all over this planet that came to help me get back to being a consensus witness.  In some ways this made my witness stronger than ever.  I&#x2019;m the only top 20 that doesn&#x2019;t have a vote from @blocktrades or @pumpkin.  Makes me feel like &#x201C;the people&#x2019;s champion.&#x201D;  Many people have stated that the top 20 is completely controlled by the two biggest actively voting stakeholders on the chain.  I&#x2019;m proof for now that it isn&#x2019;t entirely true.   It&#x2019;s kinda amazing to have achieved this level of support.  All it took was working 7 days a week on this blockchain for close to 2 years!  That&#x2019;s all you gotta do :)</p>
<h2 id="Back-on-the-mission"><a href="#Back-on-the-mission" class="headerlink" title="Back on the mission!"></a>Back on the mission!</h2><p>Spread the Values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty<br>Train and retain new members on the platform<br>Bring to life new tools to grow the Steem ecosytem</p>

<p>@aggroed<br>Witness 18</p>
<p>Special thanks to: @byubat, @transisto, @delegate.lafona, @acidyo, and @drorion for coming through with some new extra large votes to put me back in.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m grateful to the smaller accounts for sure too.  This was a team effort: @djynn, @sinner264, @jaydih, @karenb54, @tarazkp. @abh12345, @twinpapa, @coolbowser, @paulag, @caladan, @dune69, @ew-and-patterns, @ericet, @geekgirl, @whatsup, and @valth.</p>
<p>As always thanks to the 9000+ people that for for me and here&#x2019;s just a few more that let me do my job:<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbocUPfBiKuPWShrvFsaff4fC37oBLhDN4yH7hZLeFUZG/image.png" alt=""></p>

<p>@yabapmatt and I, in partnership with @harpagon, are launching a platform and accompanying website called Steem Engine (<a href="https://steem-engine.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steem-engine.com</a>) with an initial focus of allowing the creation of custom tokens on the Steem Blockchain.</p>
<h2 id="Smart-Contracts-on-a-Steem-Sidechain"><a href="#Smart-Contracts-on-a-Steem-Sidechain" class="headerlink" title="Smart Contracts on a Steem Sidechain"></a>Smart Contracts on a Steem Sidechain</h2><p>Steem Engine uses the <a href="https://github.com/harpagon210/steemsmartcontracts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steem Smart Contracts software</a>, built by @harpagon, which is a smart contract enabled sidechain platform built on top of the Steem blockchain. Initially we&#x2019;re launching with a limited set of smart contracts enabled which allow anyone to easily make custom, simple tokens on the Steem blockchain. </p>
<p><a href="steem-engine.com">Make a token now</a></p>
<p>It will also &#x201C;soon&#x201D; include an internal market, very similar to the existing STEEM/SBD market, to allow all tokens created on the platform to be traded against STEEM. Special thanks to @asgarth for help on the market user interface design and development shown below.  Testing on the market has already begun.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XqQsekE.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We hope that the ability for apps to use Steem for their token sales rather than Ethereum or other similar platforms will drive demand for the STEEM token and allow many apps and dapps to migrate and raise money here before the SMT platform is ready.</p>
<h2 id="Standardizing-Tokens-on-Steem"><a href="#Standardizing-Tokens-on-Steem" class="headerlink" title="Standardizing Tokens on Steem"></a>Standardizing Tokens on Steem</h2><p>Currently many Steem projects are setting up their own temporary tokens using various different methods, while waiting for the mythical SMTs. We think it will be very beneficial for both token creators and token holders to have all of that be in one place, working in a standardized way, with a robust toolset.</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits to token standards like ERC-20 is that any app, wallet, exchange, etc, only has to do one integration and then they can support any token using the standard. We would like to do the same thing for Steem tokens. Once any app, wallet, exchange, etc integrates with Steem Engine, they can instantly work with and support any of the tokens created on the platform.</p>
<p>Currently with Steem Engine, users can easily see what tokens are available, view balances, and make transfers right from the Steem Engine website] as well as the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/steem-keychain/lkcjlnjfpbikmcmbachjpdbijejflpcm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steem Keychain</a> and very soon the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/steemplus/mjbkjgcplmaneajhcbegoffkedeankaj?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steem Plus</a> browser extensions.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7UndXl9.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Steem-Engine-tokens-vs-SMTs"><a href="#Steem-Engine-tokens-vs-SMTs" class="headerlink" title="Steem Engine tokens vs SMTs"></a>Steem Engine tokens vs SMTs</h2><p>We want to clarify that Steem Engine Tokens are different than Smart Media Tokens (SMTs) currently(?) being developed by Steemit, Inc. SMTs will be tokens that are native to the Steem platform and their transactions will be validated by the same software which currently runs the Steem blockchain.</p>
<p>Steem Engine, on the other hand, will have all transactions posted to the Steem blockchain, so that they will all be available on a public, immutable ledger with deterministic, consensus-based transaction ordering and finality, however the validation of the transactions will be done by a separate piece of software (the Steem Smart Contracts software created by @harpagon).</p>
<p>Just as with the Steem software, the Steem Smart Contracts (SSC) software is free and open source and anyone may run their own SSC node and independently verify the transactions and query the current state of the system.</p>
<h2 id="Advantages-of-Steem-Engine-vs-SMTs"><a href="#Advantages-of-Steem-Engine-vs-SMTs" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Steem Engine vs SMTs"></a>Advantages of Steem Engine vs SMTs</h2><p>SMTs are planned to have a certain, fixed set of smart contracts implemented which are very similar to the ones currently in place for the native Steem blockchain tokens revolving primarily around content publishing and reward distribution.</p>
<p>On the other hand the Steem Smart Contracts platform, on which Steem Engine is built, will allow arbitrary, custom smart contracts to be published, similar to platforms like Ethereum and EOS.</p>
<p>While it is our ultimate goal to allow anyone to publish their own smart contracts to the platform, in the meantime the software is set up such that only the @steemsc account, controlled jointly by @harpagon, @yabapmatt, and myself, is able to publish new smart contracts.</p>
<p>The point being that it is possible to publish custom smart contracts to the platform to allow token and dapp creators to build things that will not be possible with SMTs. If you would like to create a custom smart contract on the platform, please get in touch with us on the <a href="https://discord.gg/xWRYB9s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steem Engine Discord</a> and we&#x2019;ll work with you to get it up and running!</p>
<h2 id="Roadmap"><a href="#Roadmap" class="headerlink" title="Roadmap"></a>Roadmap</h2><p>We can provide more detail in the coming weeks, but right now we&#x2019;re focused on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Improving the Steem Smart Contracts platform</li>
<li>Launching the DEX for trading tokens against STEEM</li>
<li>Building tools and interfaces to support common types of token distributions</li>
<li>Putting in place a legal services division which enables dapps to incorpate and register a Reg. D security token offering in the US which allows up to $5M/yr to be raised, including from a limited number of non-accredited investors, in a fully legal and compliant manner. Some restrictions apply.</li>
</ol>
<p>We expect major progress on all fronts in February and through the end of March.</p>

<p>Today was a rough start.  I woke up and saw that I have lost the Pumpkin vote!  For those of you who don&#x2019;t follow witness voting Pumpkin is the largest vote that any of the witnesses receive.  This vote has been on my account for over a year now and was instrumental in reaching the top 20.  Pumpkin/Freedom thank you for your support as long as I&#x2019;ve had it.  I&#x2019;ve accomplished a lot with the vote on me and it&#x2019;s helped me do a ton of things on this platform.  I&#x2019;m grateful for the vote while I had it and I hope you choose to support me again.</p>
<p>With the loss of the pumpkin vote I&#x2019;ve fallen out of the top 20 witness spots.  1 to 21 is a hard fall.  if you don&#x2019;t vote for me currently in part because you think &#x201C;well, he doesn&#x2019;t really need the vote&#x201D; things have changed and I&#x2019;d love your support.</p>
<h1 id="What-I-stand-for"><a href="#What-I-stand-for" class="headerlink" title="What I stand for"></a>What I stand for</h1><p>Since I started my witness journey I&#x2019;ve had two key thoughts guiding me.  The first is that <strong>people are the value.</strong>  When it comes down to it a currency is valued as strongly as the goods and services it produces.  The closest proxy for goods and services in an economy is the number of people involved in it.  So, crucial to making a currency have value is attracting new people and keeping them around.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve also stood for the values of <strong>Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.</strong>  These aren&#x2019;t just abstract concepts but practices that can be put into work day in and day out.  Helping people interact kindly and respectfully with one another,  helping lift people up while remembering the universe is essentially infinite, and showing that it&#x2019;s ok to talk about any and all subjects so long as we can respect other people has been my mission.  </p>
<h1 id="Things-I&#x2019;ve-helped-build"><a href="#Things-I&#x2019;ve-helped-build" class="headerlink" title="Things I&#x2019;ve helped build"></a>Things I&#x2019;ve helped build</h1><p>I cofounded the Minnow Support Project and PALnet Discord groups.  PALnet houses 20k Steemians in it and serves as a public non-profit meeting space.  It&#x2019;s run and managed by many top witnesses who with tremendous support from the moderators have made it a great place to meet others, start projects, and hang out.</p>
<p>Within the Minnow Support Project and PALnet is a streaming internet broadcast station called msp-waves.  It has dozens of DJs and hours of show every single week.  I dedicate many hours every week to hosting shows that highlight the community, bring witnesses together, and help further the Steem ecosystem.</p>
<p>I cofounded Steem Monsters.  This is a blockchain trading card game that can account for as much as 20% of activity on the chain in any given day.  We have 6,000 total players, 2,000 daily players, and 20-50k battles on any given day.  We keep people active on the network that otherwise would have abandoned Steem.  I think it&#x2019;s been an inspiration to other app developers who now realize it&#x2019;s possible to build successful businesses on the Steem blockchain.</p>
<p>I facilitated Steem Keychain, which is a browser extension like Metamask that can be used to sign into any Steem Application without having to directly hand over keys.</p>
<h1 id="Next-major-project"><a href="#Next-major-project" class="headerlink" title="Next major project"></a>Next major project</h1><p>It hasn&#x2019;t been fully announced yet, but we&#x2019;ve built a tool called steem-engine.com that allows people to make their own token on the Steem blockchain.  We&#x2019;ve collected 20 tokens as a starting point and will be gathering more especially as we have more announcements surrounding it.  A fully functional dex is in the works giving all of the tokens created a chance at instant liquidity.  If businesses can aggregate money on Steem more can come here who will need to hold the token.  It&#x2019;ll be fewer speculators and bid bot operators and more more businesses seeking to use the bandwidth for their audience.  I think this will be a critical tool for Steem to attract the businesses we need to mainstream our chain.</p>
<h1 id="in-the-trenches"><a href="#in-the-trenches" class="headerlink" title="in the trenches"></a>in the trenches</h1><p>Since HF20 took so long to implement there haven&#x2019;t been a lot of opportunities to revamp the chain.  I&#x2019;ve been around for a few chain restarts and one major Hard Fork.  Witnessing is a weird gig.  You&#x2019;re always sort of on call, and always feeling the stress of someone trying to take your spot.  The duties though come in spurts where the actual function of a witness sometimes just means that everything else in your life is put on hold for a day or up to a week to get the chain started and that&#x2019;s the highest priority.  I&#x2019;m not sure those are the times that I&#x2019;d say I&#x2019;ve enjoyed being a witness, but I can certainly say that I&#x2019;ll look back at those times fondly of being in the war room watching blocks tick by and hoping one and then another witness can latch on and get the chain restarted.</p>
<h1 id="Who-knows-what&#x2019;s-good-or-bad"><a href="#Who-knows-what&#x2019;s-good-or-bad" class="headerlink" title="Who knows what&#x2019;s good or bad"></a>Who knows what&#x2019;s good or bad</h1><p>From an objective standpoint losing the largest vote on the platform is a bad day for my witness, but who can know what&#x2019;s good or bad.  This is already pushing me to campaign again and there will be other life changes that occur because of this and other events to come.  It&#x2019;s impossible to know the outcome, but here&#x2019;s a good time to trust in the universe that plans are afoot and I welcome surprise changes as they come along. I had a feeling that witness 1 would be short lived and have come to trust those instincts.  I was called to do a task and helped direct this community back towards 1 chain and creation of a foundation to benefit all Steemians.  It&#x2019;s impossible to tell why I lost the vote, but I wouldn&#x2019;t change the actions that I&#x2019;ve taken.  </p>
<h1 id="It&#x2019;s-been-an-honor-to-serve-as-a-consensus-witness"><a href="#It&#x2019;s-been-an-honor-to-serve-as-a-consensus-witness" class="headerlink" title="It&#x2019;s been an honor to serve as a consensus witness"></a>It&#x2019;s been an honor to serve as a consensus witness</h1><p>I hope to hold that honor again.  This is my home and I like holding the responsibility to maintain it.  This change puts me back on the campaign trail asking for witness votes and support.  If you think I&#x2019;ve done a good job keeping this chain together, making changes, bringing about business, and you value Peace, Abundance, and Liberty and community growth then please vote for my witness.</p>

            <p>Hey Ned,  </p>
<p>Glad to see that the powerdown has stopped.  I know it restarted back on programmatic selling, and I have no qualms with that.  Thanks for stopping the major powerdown.  I think it&#x2019;s an important step to healing the divide between Steemit and frustrated witnesses, large stake holders, and sections of the community at large.</p>
<p>I want to express my gratitude not only for that, but also your changes regarding how you&#x2019;re interacting with the community.  </p>
<p>I expressed 4 major problems a few weeks ago: Fiscal management, communication, open development process, and mass adoption.  Additionally, Tim has had concerns around transparency, and Jesta has shared concerns around accountability.</p>
<p>I can&#x2019;t speak for them, but I think I see improvement in every category.  I think some of the mindset at Steemit has shifted.  So far it&#x2019;s looking better now than it was a few weeks ago.  Nice job!  Change isn&#x2019;t easy.  It took a while to get here, but I&#x2019;m feeling much better about this whole thing these days.</p>
<p>I want to add that @elipowell is doing a great job helping to mend some old challenges and build some new pathways that feel more inclusive than the previous approaches.  I was excited to see Vandeberg come on air too during Pennsif&#x2019;s forum.  That seems like another great step in the right direction towards changing the culture around Steemit.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m looking forward to seeing transparency reports.  I&#x2019;m looking forward to figuring out ways that Steemit and the many Dapps can work together to grow this ecosystem.  I&#x2019;m pleased seeing how these changes that seem to have taken root and show a little light.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ll continue doing my best to grow this ecosystem through Apps and Communities.  Let me know if there are specific ways that I can help or how I could be of service.</p>
<p>Overall, this seems like a good start at a real turnaround and I&#x2019;m looking forward to watching it play out.</p>
<p>Keep it up!  </p>
