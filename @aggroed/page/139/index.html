<p>Hey @Ned,</p>
<p>The first thing I did today as soon as I woke up was check fuzzy&#x2019;s posts to see if your flags were still there.  I was disappointed to see that they were.  So far no harm has been caused by them having been placed, but if the posts clear you will cause $1,600 of harm to 1,600 votes and their respective voters and post author.  There&#x2019;s still time to do this a different way.</p>
<p>Please remove your flags.</p>
<h2 id="These-flags-appear-as-a-form-of-violence"><a href="#These-flags-appear-as-a-form-of-violence" class="headerlink" title="These flags appear as a form of violence "></a>These flags appear as a form of violence </h2><h2></h2><p>Striking someone or taking money from them without citing the cause is a form of violence.  Striking 1,600 individual votes and their respective voters and removing post rewards is again a form of violence, but done to many people.  Sometimes these things are justified or justifiable, but you have no explanation on the block so it&#x2019;s unclear what your motives are and unclear what your intentions are.  </p>
<p>Please remove your flags.</p>
<h2 id="Please-use-your-words-first-and-your-flags-last"><a href="#Please-use-your-words-first-and-your-flags-last" class="headerlink" title="Please use your words first, and your flags last."></a>Please use your words first, and your flags last.</h2><p>It would seem you have many routes still available to you especially as Fuzzy seems more than willing to talk it out.  Can you please remove your flags and instead just reach out and talk to the guy?</p>
<h2 id="Your-message-is-muddled"><a href="#Your-message-is-muddled" class="headerlink" title="Your message is muddled "></a>Your message is muddled </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;ve had multiple discussions with multiple people directly involved and those that aren&#x2019;t.  The one thing that is clear is that it&#x2019;s unclear what you&#x2019;re protesting.  Leaving 3 very large flags without any explanation doesn&#x2019;t actually let this audience know why you&#x2019;re upset, why you think you&#x2019;ve been harmed, or what your intentions are.  If you&#x2019;re trying to send a message with these flags the message isn&#x2019;t coming through.</p>
<p>Please remove your flags, and just reach out to Fuzzy.</p>
<h2 id="Values"><a href="#Values" class="headerlink" title="Values "></a>Values </h2><h2></h2><p>There&#x2019;s a reason the Minnow Support Project isn&#x2019;t in it&#x2019;s own Discord Channel.  It&#x2019;s sitting in the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty network.  The project is in that channel to support those values, which I think are pretty universal in this community.  There are now 4500+ Steemians that are in the PALnet channel, and it&#x2019;s the largest off-chain Steemian Community by several thousand people.  I&#x2019;m feeling pretty confidant that Steemians want Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.</p>
<h2 id="Your-3-flags-don&#x2019;t-hold-true-to-those-values"><a href="#Your-3-flags-don&#x2019;t-hold-true-to-those-values" class="headerlink" title="Your 3 flags don&#x2019;t hold true to those values "></a>Your 3 flags don&#x2019;t hold true to those values </h2><h2></h2><p>Using flags to express displeasure when you haven&#x2019;t used your words first isn&#x2019;t a testament to the value of Peace.<br>Using flags that take away post rewards from 1,600 votes and their respective voters isn&#x2019;t a testament to Abundance.<br>Using flags to silence or attempt to silence Fuzzy isn&#x2019;t a testament to Liberty.</p>
<p>Please remove your flags.</p>
<h2 id="I-don&#x2019;t-consent-to-your-actions-Ned-please-change-them"><a href="#I-don&#x2019;t-consent-to-your-actions-Ned-please-change-them" class="headerlink" title="I don&#x2019;t consent to your actions Ned, please change them  "></a>I don&#x2019;t consent to your actions Ned, please change them  </h2><h2></h2><p>Ned,  please remove the flags.  Please reach out to Fuzzy instead.  You still have several days to do this without any real harm having been caused.  Please send a message, and try to work it out without flagging.  This seems entirely possible and doable in this case.  Please make that effort!</p>
<h2 id="We-have-a-world-to-change"><a href="#We-have-a-world-to-change" class="headerlink" title="We have a world to change "></a>We have a world to change </h2><h2></h2><p>Ned, as I noted. I really respect the shit out of what you&#x2019;re trying to accomplish.  I&#x2019;m incredibly grateful for your efforts to build this platform and accelerate it&#x2019;s growth.  This blockchain, this community, and our collective voice have the ability to change the world.  That will happen infinitely better if we&#x2019;re aligned as a community and working collaboratively.  We have some big things we have to do as a community if we&#x2019;re going to take on wordpress, gmail, reddit, facebook, and a list of other competitors.  To do that we&#x2019;re going to need people that can think up and code great projects.  The entire ecosystem and the goals of the platform truly needs the part of the ecosystem that you&#x2019;re flagging.  </p>
<p>So, please unflag the three posts with 1600+ votes, reach out in any number of ways, and mend before any actual harm happens.  We won&#x2019;t look at that as a capitulation, but as a success in leadership.  </p>
<p>I&#x2019;m counting on your to find another way and lead by example here.  All the minnows are looking up to you.  Please don&#x2019;t let us down.</p>

<p>Dear @ned and @officialfuzzy,</p>
<p>Let me start by saying I admire the shit out of both you.  @ned, I spend hours on this platform every day.  I&#x2019;ve built a 4,400 Steemian community in Discord, and we&#x2019;re in the middle of building a radio show to support it.  I love it here, and you were key in making that possible.  I&#x2019;m exceptionally grateful.  Thank you for creating this place and thank you for continuing to move it forward.</p>
<p>Fuzzy,  you&#x2019;re awesome.  I wouldn&#x2019;t have MSP if I hadn&#x2019;t been talking with you earlier in my path here.  Whaleshares was a giant influence in how I crafted the Minnow Support Project.  There over a thousand minnows every day that benefit from the insights you shared with me.  1600 votes a day!  That&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re doing, and it wouldn&#x2019;t be possible without your tenure in the crypto and guild space which you used to help me understand how to build a community around Steemit.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m personally indebted to you both, and insanely grateful to you both.  Hopefully that comes across in the next part of this.</p>
<h2 id="Flagging-in-general"><a href="#Flagging-in-general" class="headerlink" title="Flagging in general "></a>Flagging in general </h2><h2></h2><p>Here&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;ve come to think about this after my own brief visit into flagging.  There are basically two different types of flags: offensive and defensive.  It&#x2019;s remarkably easy to blur the lines.</p>
<p>A defensive flag is one where you protect yourself, usually from disinformation, lies, trolls, or to generally punish someone for harming you.</p>
<p>An offensive flag is where you&#x2019;re trying to stir shit up.  You have a point to make, and you&#x2019;re letting your SP do the talkin&#x2019;.  </p>
<p>One challenge though is that Flagging is a form of violence.  You cause harm, both to rep which people work hard to attain and post rewards for authors and curators.  So, a big flag harms the intended post author, but also take rewards away from many curators.  If you took $1600 from me on the street I&#x2019;d call that violence.  If the government coerces me to pay under threat of violence I&#x2019;ll call that violence.  When you take post rewards away on Steemit that&#x2019;s violence too.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m a pacifist, but some violence is justified.  We&#x2019;ll discuss some of that in part two, but for now, if you flag on Steemit with a bunch of anarchist libertarian peace loving people you sure as hell better come with a  good reason.  Otherwise you&#x2019;re inviting the exact opposite of what you intend.</p>
<h2 id="Unintended-consequences-of-flagging"><a href="#Unintended-consequences-of-flagging" class="headerlink" title="Unintended consequences of flagging "></a>Unintended consequences of flagging </h2><h2></h2><p>What I&#x2019;ve learned is that both of these approaches have consequences on this platform, and more often than not it&#x2019;s not what you expect.  </p>
<p>I&#x2019;m left to speculate as to the reasons of the flagging because there wasn&#x2019;t anything left publicly spoken on the block, but Ned doesn&#x2019;t toss a lot of flags around, so I&#x2019;m assuming he felt slighted.  I listened to the talk on Fuzzy&#x2019;s show.  Nothing sounded outrageous, but I&#x2019;m betting there&#x2019;s beef here that goes back a while, and maybe I&#x2019;m missing a piece to this.</p>
<p>But those flags Ned did a few things right&#x2026; You took post rewards from people that upvoted them in good faith, and then like a million buzzing bees there were suddenly posts all over Steemit about the flags.  Instead of looking like a potential victim of a long grudge you look like the aggressor, and so people are rallying around Fuzzy.  In the end you&#x2019;re actually bringing increased support to him because now people that don&#x2019;t think your flag is righteous feel compelled to rally around him.  The other thing that happened was that news and commentary of your intended-to-be private conversations on slack leaked by Fuzzy.</p>
<p>Fuzzy, I&#x2019;m betting that&#x2019;s but a tiny trove of things that were said under the pretense that they were meant to be kept private.  I can&#x2019;t quite tell if you&#x2019;re justified in releasing private conversation publicly, but I know you&#x2019;re riding a very tight line here between defending yourself and betraying trust.</p>
<p>Luckily though there isn&#x2019;t real damage that can&#x2019;t be undone, so I&#x2019;d like to ask that you guys as leaders in this community to chart a different path forward from here.</p>
<h2 id="It-starts-with-deescalation"><a href="#It-starts-with-deescalation" class="headerlink" title="It starts with deescalation "></a>It starts with deescalation </h2><h2></h2><p>Ned.  There&#x2019;s still time to remove the flags.<br>Fuzzy you haven&#x2019;t released anything damning.  Please don&#x2019;t.</p>
<p>Can you please both agree to put the guns down?</p>
<h2 id="How-about-a-conversation"><a href="#How-about-a-conversation" class="headerlink" title="How about a conversation?  "></a>How about a conversation?  </h2><h2></h2><p>You both know how to contact each other.  Can you please pick up the phone/device/Discord and try to talk this shit out?  We all go to the same moon you know!?!  We&#x2019;re all trying to work on this platform.  We&#x2019;re all trying to make this place better.  It&#x2019;ll get there faster and be better if we can collectively work together on it.  Honestly, we really need you guys to model the best behavior possible.  It&#x2019;s ok to get angry, and sometimes this shit has to come out, but now that it has it&#x2019;s up to you to figure out how to navigate it.</p>
<p>You&#x2019;re both doing some pretty epic shit.  I know there is some competition with BTS and that community, but they are on Steemit in a big way.  The Steemit community benefits by having them here even with a little cooperticion.  </p>
<p>Similarly look at what you&#x2019;re doing recently Fuzzy.  You&#x2019;ve made a shit ton and can build to your heart&#x2019;s content because Steemit whales are supporting your mission.</p>
<p>This relationship is mutually beneficial for you both and for the whole platform.</p>
<p>Again, please work it out.  This whole community needs you to!</p>
<h2 id="A-word-of-caution-about-victimhood"><a href="#A-word-of-caution-about-victimhood" class="headerlink" title="A word of caution about victimhood "></a>A word of caution about victimhood </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m sure you both feel to some extent like the victim here.  Please be careful with that too.  Victims are often violent.  They lash out when they shouldn&#x2019;t.  I hope you guys can holster that feeling too, and hopefully you can both extend a good olive branch to the other.</p>
<p>A few months from now when we&#x2019;re all sitting on $10 steem we&#x2019;ll laugh at this, and the first round&#x2019;s on me, but this whole community is looking at you now.  Please don&#x2019;t let us down.</p>
<p>Namaste,</p>
<p>Aggroed</p>

<p>So, the meetup was a success!  We&#x2019;ll meet again in about a month and a half.  With a few more people in the loop we&#x2019;ll look to grow it.  Next time I think we&#x2019;ll go for a local bar/restaurant and pour post rewards into free food and beer rather than post promotion.  We&#x2019;ll keep growing!</p>
<p>It was pretty nice though to find some other steemians.  @justtryme90 strikes me as a smart and kind fellow passionate about science.  @r0nd0n didn&#x2019;t disappoint with a passion for liberty and free speech.  @orangeshasta clearly likes the two things on their blog weed and cryptotrading.  Orange has a science background and showed up just after @justtryme90 so we had 3 nerds at the table to start.  Lastly we were blessed to have @errigankerrigan join us as well who I didn&#x2019;t get too much opportunity to talk with.</p>
<p>Anyway, good times were had.  Beers drank, legal recreational substances consumed, conversation held, and new friends made.  I think that&#x2019;s the point.  I&#x2019;m targeting the weekend of September 16th or 23rd for the next one, and yes there will be a next one. </p>
<p>In true crypto fashion we decided to take a photo sans faces, but nevertheless we were all smiling!  Good times and a pleasure to meet you all.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve been advocating to make serialized posts on here forever.  My own first series was Aggroed&#x2019;s Antidote followed by Meme The News and I&#x2019;ve added others.  I have a witness series, I have a graphic novel I&#x2019;m building in Nagan VII, and I have STEEMIT TIPS.  Serializing posts is a way to connect with your audience and keep them with you, but to be honest, the wall is a very obnoxious way to store these.  The wall is basically an infinite list of every post you made or resteemed in chronological order.  So, if someone wants to read Nagan VII start to finish I either have to post every link every time which is a growing pain in the butt, or they have to go through my entire wall.  Especially since Nagan VII started as a flash fiction post rather than a Nagan VII entitled series you wouldn&#x2019;t even be able to find them all.</p>
