        <div class="content">

<p>So, you&#x2019;re nearing retirement.  You have some money saved and you&#x2019;re thinking about your investments and about what you&#x2019;re going to leave behind for your family.  You have a son or daughter that mentions Steemit, almost kinda nags about it, and you&#x2019;re wondering to yourself &#x201C;why should I bother with that newfangled thing?&#x201D;</p>
<h2 id="1-Trillion"><a href="#1-Trillion" class="headerlink" title="1 Trillion "></a>1 Trillion </h2><h2></h2><p>Right now the market cap of the crypto space is 100 Billion dollars and fluctuates around there.  Over the next 5-10 years that&#x2019;s likely going to grow by an order of magnitude to 1 trillion or more.  If you want transparency, speed, lack of regulation, questionable gray tax zone, and a bastion of free speech and liberty look no further than the crypto space.</p>
<h2 id="It&#x2019;s-volitile"><a href="#It&#x2019;s-volitile" class="headerlink" title="It&#x2019;s volitile "></a>It&#x2019;s volitile </h2><h2></h2><p>If you like to watch your investments then this place is amazing and terrifying.  If you like to set it and forget this place probably won&#x2019;t let you down.  Crypto is very much the wild west.  So, you get swings where bitcoin can lose 90% of it&#x2019;s value and take all the other coins with it.  So, if you&#x2019;re sitting there waiting on your social security check to live it&#x2019;s probably a bad idea, but if you have some money that you&#x2019;re still able to invest for the long game then crypto is amazing.  If you like to day trade you&#x2019;d be hard pressed to find a place where the swings are larger.  Look bitcoin just went from 3k to 1.9k and back up to 2.8.  When have you seen IBM do that?  You don&#x2019;t remember and it&#x2019;s not just the memory loss.</p>
<p>So, yeah, it&#x2019;s kinda scary, but if you learn a lot about this place and figure out what is moving the market you can make money on the way down, and the way back up, and the way back down, have some lunch and do again in the afternoon.</p>
<h2 id="&#x2018;Cus&#x2019;-Liberty"><a href="#&#x2018;Cus&#x2019;-Liberty" class="headerlink" title="&#x2018;Cus&#x2019; Liberty "></a>&#x2018;Cus&#x2019; Liberty </h2><h2></h2><p>Look, you&#x2019;re probably a boomer.  You likely fell for all the propaganda about America being the greatest nation ever while they glossed over bombing another set of countries and endless war during your lifetime.  Maybe just maybe, something that your kids have said about &#x201C;Maybe America shouldn&#x2019;t be in so many wars&#x201D; or &#x201C;If these are the two best candidates we can produce maybe there is something fundamentally wrong with our democracy&#x201D; that actually resonated.  Maybe something felt weird when the tsa agent was touching your breasts like you were some terrorist suspect or when they did it to your 4 year old granddaughter.  You&#x2019;d like to see a different world left for your kids, but you inherently know that you&#x2019;re not gonna get there using the same tools that built this one.  Just take a second to think what would a different world look like?  How could you make it better?  I think you&#x2019;ll see some similarities to Steemit with future potentials.</p>
<h2 id="You&#x2019;re-tired-of-inflation"><a href="#You&#x2019;re-tired-of-inflation" class="headerlink" title="You&#x2019;re tired of inflation "></a>You&#x2019;re tired of inflation </h2><h2></h2><p>If you haven&#x2019;t noticed yet the money that you put in your bank account 10 years ago buys half as much shit today.  That&#x2019;s not an accident.  That&#x2019;s inflation.  They hide the numbers by changing container sizes all the time and things like that, but it&#x2019;s hard to get away from the fact that you used to fill your grocery cart for $100 and now it&#x2019;s looking like $200 or more IF you&#x2019;re even able to pay that much.  Inflation robs you every single day you live.  The USG alone prints 160 million dollars a day.  that&#x2019;s pure inflation, and you&#x2019;ve been fed some bs that it&#x2019;s good for you, but since when was sky high housing and unaffordable groceries a good thing?</p>
<p>Crypto currencies have a very small amount of inflation.  Some have none.  While they aren&#x2019;t all technically deflationary some are so close that in comparison to government currencies they are functionally deflationary.  That means 10 years from today your coins will purchase twice as many groceries as they could today.  Yes, the prices fluctuate, but simply compared to inflation of US dollars if you&#x2019;re gonna hoard some currency let it be cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2 id="Steemit-is-fun"><a href="#Steemit-is-fun" class="headerlink" title="Steemit is fun "></a>Steemit is fun </h2><h2></h2><p>You read an article you liked by some super cute chica named Alla.  You imported a savings account or two and sold some goldman sachs stock after realizing that the profits came because they did some shady shit.  Now you have a boatload of steem, drop an upvote, and you hit that hot chica with a $100 upvote and before you even go to lunch you get a quick &#x201C;thank you so much I&#x201D;m so grateful.&#x201D;  I mean that&#x2019;s amazing.  You can print money with your stake.  Where else can you do that?  You want to help poor people in Africa?  UPVOTE!  BOOM!  Dude has enough cash to build a well.  Wanna help a buddy in Caracas cause Venezuelens deserve to eat too?  UPVOTE!  BOOM!  Now that dude can feed his family for a week.  It didn&#x2019;t cost you a penny, but now you&#x2019;re supporting people across the world.  Face it, Steemit is fun!</p>
<h2 id="You-lived-through-a-lot-of-shit-time-to-tell-your-story"><a href="#You-lived-through-a-lot-of-shit-time-to-tell-your-story" class="headerlink" title="You lived through a lot of shit, time to tell your story "></a>You lived through a lot of shit, time to tell your story </h2><h2></h2><p>Lastly, this world has so many examples of story telling.  In fact, entertainment is one of the most heavily valued industries in the world.  Look, dust off the old thinking cap after 50 years of taking orders in some corporate shithole and take charge of your life.  Tell some stories, share some knowledge, and leave something on the blockchain that will literally be there forever.  Tell your story, maybe your kids won&#x2019;t listen, but we will.</p>

        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>@sircork made a meme.  It&#x2019;s been in my head since I saw it.  Steemit is without a doubt an awesome platform, but there&#x2019;s also a rather steep learning curve to climb in order to figure this place out.  I thought I&#x2019;d take a quick stab at putting this stuff all in one place.  It&#x2019;s like your steemit vocab list.<br><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmZ21nWjpYEQjPTBMRcR9doM6UjVhzXU7Gjvy2CREKn2Gf/steem%20cat.png" alt="steem cat.png"></p>
<h2 id="Functional-Vocabulary"><a href="#Functional-Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="Functional Vocabulary "></a>Functional Vocabulary </h2><h2></h2><p>Blockchain:  A type of digital ledger.  It keeps track of all transactions.  Think of making an excel sheet and every 3 seconds you hit save and it adds the snap shot of changes as a new block to the chain.  The chain contains all information that&#x2019;s ever happened.  Steemit.com and websites like it are able to view and retrieve information from the chain in an easily digestible format.</p>
<p>Witness:  Technically it&#x2019;s a server that helps assemble the blockchain.  It&#x2019;s also a person.  The witnesses are elected members of the community.  The server settings effect things like average blocksize, percent interest on SBDs, and the witnesses publish prices used to calculate values and earnings by backend of the blockchain.  Many witnesses focus on the technical end of the blockchain.  They may add new features and sister websites to use the blockchain in novel ways.  Many witnesses also think of themselves having a social purpose helping new members, advocating for the community, or explaining what all this stuff is.</p>
<p>Steemit.  Steemit is a company that runs the steemit.com website.  It was founded by @ned and @dan.  @dan has since left and is now managed by @ned.  There are a fairly large number of developers that work to keep the website improving and adding new features to the steemit.com interface.  Steemit is currently working on their next set of goals, which is to increase the rate at which this ecosystem can onboard new members.</p>
<p>Steem:  Steem is a unit of currency.  It&#x2019;s created by the Steemit Blockchain.  The value fluctuates so, it&#x2019;s hard to compare it to something.  It&#x2019;s like owning a volatile stock that goes up and down in vale, but as of right now hovers between $1-2/steem.</p>
<p>Steem Power:  If you own steem you can convert it into Steem Power.  This is like owning and activating a stock in a company.  You now own X% of the output of the blockchain and can exert some control over it.  If you have high steem power your upvotes are worth more.</p>
<p>Steem Backed Dollars (SBDs):  This is a measurement of debt to be paid by the blockchain.  The percent interest fluctuates, but is set by the witnesses, which they use to ensure it stays worth at least $1.</p>
<p>Crypto Currency-  These come in many fashions, but largely they are digital currency alternatives to government issued debt based notes.  The crypto is in reference to many of them using cryptography as a method to secure interactions and transfer of digital currencies.</p>
<p>Exchange:  Much like a stock exchange you can exchange crypto currencies for one another.  Just like you can sell apple stocks to purchase IBM you can buy and trade bitcoins for litecoins or steem.  Exchanges are marketplaces where people buy and sell the difference currencies for one another.  A very common exchange is bittrex.</p>
<p>Coin:  The crypto currencies usually refer to themselves as coins.  Bitcoin is an example.  There is also Litecoin and Dogecoin.  These are not printed metal coins, but digital currency that use the term coin to loosely describe it&#x2019;s association to money.</p>
<p>Token:  Token is another commenly used term for a digital currency or thing of value.  You can think of them like poker chips representing value.</p>
<p>Wallet:  A wallet is a program that stores the value of one or more cryptocurrencies.  You typically have an address that is either a name in the case of Steemit or a long string of numbers and letters in the case of Bitcoin.  If you want to buy, sell, or transfer your currency it likely is going into and out of one or more wallets.  You can think of these as the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank account.</p>
<p>Transfer:  Just like handing you a $5 dollar bill I can transfer value digitally too.  This can be like wiring money in the banking world where you send it from one account to another.  A transfer is how you bring digital currency from one wallet to another.</p>
<p>Fiat Currency:  Fiat generally means backed by nothing.  Government currencies used to be backed by gold, but in the 1970s Nixon took america off of the gold standard.  Now the common understanding is that US Dollars are backed by nothing.  Thus they are called fiat currencies.  People are often concerned about infinite inflation when currencies can be printed without any limit like the amount of physical gold in the world.</p>
<p>Distribution:  People referencing this are generally speaking about the percent ownership of steem by it&#x2019;s members.  Currently steemit has a rather slanted distribution with the top 1% of steem holders owning 93% of the steem.</p>
<p>Upvote:  If you like a story you can upvote it.  This not only shows the author that you like their content, but it also put some rewards towards their posts</p>
<p>Resteem:  This is similar to the share function on facebook.  You are able to share stories from authors you have enjoyed reading to your follower list when you click the resteem option.</p>
<p>voting power:  You have a maximum voting power of 100%.  Every time you vote it slowly drains.  Every day it comes back by 20%.  A typical maximum vote drains 2% of your remaining voting power.  So, a max vote at 100% voting power will remove 2% of your voting power.  A max vote at 50% of your voting power will only remove 1% of your voting power because it&#x2019;s removing the power based on what you have left.</p>
<p>The steemit anology is a pool that&#x2019;s constantly being filled by rain and you are manually draining it by removing bucket loads at a time.  The rain is teh 20% that refills teh pool every day.  Your votes are teh bucketloads coming out of the remaining water.</p>
<p>Followers:  People that like your stories have the option to click the follow button and subscribe to your articles.  Every time you publish your followers will automatically receive the story.</p>
<h2 id="Slang"><a href="#Slang" class="headerlink" title="Slang "></a>Slang </h2><h2></h2><p>Steemes:  The combination of the word Steem and meme.  These can be memes about steem or simply memes created and posted to steemit.</p>
<p>Whales, Dolphins, Minnows, Redfish:  These fish analogies typically reference the amount of wealth someone has.  While the terms are used broadly across the cryptocurrency space on Steemit the ranges go like this:</p>
<p>Redfish:  0-1000SP<br>Minnow: 0-5000 SP<br>Dolphin: 5000-50000<br>Whale: 50000+ SP</p>
<p>Whale balz:  a vulgar reference to the amount of steem an account holder posses.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-profit-on-Steemit"><a href="#How-to-profit-on-Steemit" class="headerlink" title="How to profit on Steemit "></a>How to profit on Steemit </h2><h2></h2><p>The fastest advice I have for you is that different activities will represent a larger portion of your income depending on how much SP you have.  I generally encourage folks to get 300 followers before starting to concentrate more heavily on authoring if their intent is simply growth.  In general the advice goes like this-</p>
<p>Minnows comment, dolphins author, whales curate</p>
<p>Commenting:  You can add feedback on every article.  These are called comments.</p>
<p>Author:  When you write a new post and publish that to the world that&#x2019;s considered authoring</p>
<p>Curate:  When you spend a lot of time upvoting posts and comments that&#x2019;s consider commenting.  People whale accounts can make money curating it&#x2019;s effectively the fastest wealth generator for them.</p>

<p>Santana felt his firm arms wrap around her.  His muscular arm pulled her in deeper into the spoon as they lay in bed.  She could hear him breathing softly by her ear.  A few whiskers tickling the back of her neck.  And then he said &#x201C;RING RING RING RING.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The warm dream of her husband wrapped around her faded as a video message came through.  It was her son; a rare message.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hi Admiral Santana, ummm, I&#x2019;m coming back to Nagan VII for a little bit.  I&#x2019;ve decided to have my name day afterall.  It&#x2019;ll be at CryptoRocket&#x2019;s on 5th and main in Nagnarock.  I&#x2019;ll send you more details.  It would be nice to see you there.  I hope you&#x2019;re well and can make it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Santana sat there blinking at the screen.  She hadn&#x2019;t heard from her son in four years since her husband died.  She hadn&#x2019;t dreamt of her husband in a while either.  Someone was hacking the matrix today.  Also, Santana had thought her son had completely abandoned everything to do with Nagan VII, so, having a nameday was a surprise too.</p>
<p>She checked the calendar and saw it was just 3 days away.  She had more questions than answers.  Oddly she thought of Tanic.  She checked his calendar too and he seemed to have the night free.  This could be good for him to witness.  She crossed over to her messages and typed out: </p>
<p>Tanic, my son is having a name day celebration.  I&#x2019;d love to have you join us.  Also, I should have details on the last steps of repairing your ship.  I&#x2019;m transferring it to your calendar.  Tanic Jr. and Vanessa are both welcome.  Please try to be on your best though.  </p>
<hr>
<p>Well, it&#x2019;s a weird day, but a good day.  Maybe her son will finally come home&#x2026;</p>

<p>There is a long story about only two ways to have enough.  One is the unending conquest to have more.  More money, more sex, more house, more status, more whatever.  The other is simply to declare that you now have enough, and draw a line for yourself that this is the point where you&#x2019;re willing to be satisfied.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m a dude.  Just a plain normal dude.  If it wasn&#x2019;t for wife and children i could live in a tent.  Worst case a dorm.  I like being fed, but I don&#x2019;t need much space above a bed, a computer desk, a bathroom, and a communal kitchen.</p>
<p>That said, I have more than enough.  I&#x2019;m lucky enough to be a phd with 20 years of experience.  I&#x2019;ve been a college professor.  I&#x2019;m a lucky guy.  The challenge is no longer having enough.  The two options presented from what I grew up with don&#x2019;t seem to work.  The question always struck me as a material wealth thing.  Always in the constant struggle for more money to buy whatever.  I&#x2019;m not much interested in that.  Actually, I kinda hate it.</p>
<p>The world is run by immoral banksters, and every time, literally every single time, I do any transaction or hold onto one of their fiat debt notes I know that I empower them.  This is a crushing realization to me.  When I pay my mortgage, taxes, energy bill, buy gas, or do anything with their notes I give them power.  Power that I know they missue mostly to kill dark skinned people in third world nations to take resources that don&#x2019;t belong to them.  It&#x2019;s a wicked system.  My answers are to make daily change to not consent and to not participate.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m bummed I don&#x2019;t have a Mayflower I can hop onto and find a new world.  I suppose I could do what the US forefathers did and just find a different spot and murder everyone there, but I have this stout belief in the importance of peace.  But then too the most recent Mad Max movie has my brain all twisted.  They go through literal hell to escape an oppressive shithouse dictatorship only to turn around to take it back over because you gotta clean up where you came from.  Have you seen the sprawling government that impacts trillions of dollars&#x2026; how the fuck do you clean that up?</p>
<p>Anyway, despite wanting to earn some stake around here my end game isn&#x2019;t wealth.  What would I do with it?  I just want to live peacefully in a shitty dorm room with a nice comp.  It&#x2019;s not like it&#x2019;s that expensive a lifestyle.  So, I&#x2019;m not pursuing economically speaking a financial enough.  I&#x2019;m pursuing a world where I can say I&#x2019;ve done enough to change it.  I suppose I could just be content with what&#x2019;s around me, but there&#x2019;s this burning passion inside to leave something different.  Every night as I went to bed my mother would say &#x201C;Leave this place better than you found it.&#x201D;  The message is right and its advice I&#x2019;ll gladly follow.</p>
<p>I guess my ultimate fear is to myself and to my one day woke ass kids.  They&#x2019;ll turn to me and say &#x201C;dad, you knew about the way the world works?  What did you do about it?&#x201D;  I want an answer worthy of the beauty they bring to my world.  Maybe that day won&#x2019;t come, and I&#x2019;m just pressuring myself&#x2026; idk&#x2026; but for now it isn&#x2019;t enough.</p>
<p>This world is broken, it has to change, and that change has to start with me.  Until it does change I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;ll be enough.  So, I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow.  And the next day.  And the next day.  When my kids and your kids can hold hands around the world and live with peace, abundance, and liberty I&#x2019;ll call it quits.  Until then I have this idea I&#x2019;ve been thinking about&#x2026;</p>

<p>What can I say?  I like milestone posts.  You know there are lots of delegations happening on Steemit, but the Minnow Support Project is nearing 50% of all delegations happening in the community.  Well, that&#x2019;s not 50% of the delegated steem by the way, it&#x2019;s just 50% of all the delegations that have happened&#x2026; I mean.. we&#x2019;re minnows here.  The whole point is these guys don&#x2019;t have much steem, but by working together and forming a community they start looking like a dolphin or whale.</p>
<h2 id="3500-People"><a href="#3500-People" class="headerlink" title="3500 People  "></a>3500 People  </h2><h2></h2><p>It&#x2019;s kinda  shit ton.  We&#x2019;ve slowed down a bit with the price of BTC falling, but now that steem is picking up steam we&#x2019;re seeing the number of new members rise up again.  We&#x2019;ll likely be at 4000 by the end of the month.  They aren&#x2019;t all active community members by any means, but we&#x2019;re also picking new witnesses, whales, and dolphins in the channel almost every day.  We&#x2019;re spitting out new witnesses by the dozen it seems.  Every day another minnow wants to be a witness.  I take a lot of pride in that.<br> Good to see these folks want to give back.</p>
<p>Somedays I just sit back and watch the general chat fly by and get a warm smile on my face and think &#x201C;I helped make this!&#x201D;  I mean, how many people can create a 3500 person organization and keep folks engaged and moving.</p>
<h2 id="Moderators"><a href="#Moderators" class="headerlink" title="Moderators "></a>Moderators </h2><h2></h2><p>We added a few more mods and will continue to do so.   Having thousands of people kinda does that to a place.  You know the mods aren&#x2019;t supposed to be heavy handed ban hammer tossers.  It&#x2019;s the Peace, Abundance, and Liberty Network.  You know, we like peace, abundance, and liberty.  So, yeah, abusers get banned and hammered, but people that can follow like the 2 rules we have do fine.  1.  Don&#x2019;t post your steemit shit in General.  2.  Follow community standards and don&#x2019;t vote porn.  3.  Don&#x2019;t make a million alts and spam vote yourself.</p>
<h2 id="We-busted-some-kid-from-the-Phillipines"><a href="#We-busted-some-kid-from-the-Phillipines" class="headerlink" title="We busted some kid from the Phillipines "></a>We busted some kid from the Phillipines </h2><h2></h2><p>We&#x2019;re at a stage where we have enough people from the public to start doing bad shit.  I think it&#x2019;s a stage of growth kinda thing.  Or a numbers game.  Eventually gonna have a few bad eggs.  The fact it took 3500 people before we really started having some bad actors should say something positive about us and the system we got.</p>
<p>So, what?  Should we nuke his account?  Should we ban all Fillipinos?  Nope.  We&#x2019;re gonna work with him to try to teach him about peace, abundance, and liberty and to not be a theiving douchbag.  He seems amenable.  Kinda seems like a kid with some tough luck and bad decisions.  But I&#x2019;m not gonna nuke him if he&#x2019;s playing ball and trying to make amends.  His first pass may have been a little weak, but he&#x2019;s got a lot to learn.  </p>
<p>My wife told me a long time ago when I was having trust issues with her because of an absolutely insane ex-grilfriend (the end of that story was my mother ended up driving her to a pyschward while I was out of state).  Anyways, my very patient wife says to me &#x201C;I&#x2019;m willing to wait with you, but not willing to wait for you.&#x201D;  It&#x2019;s one of the best pieces of advice my ears have ever heard.  to mean it means accept the flaws of those around you so long as they work on them with intention.  Kid seems to have positive intention even if his execution needs work.  That&#x2019;s enough for me.</p>
<h2 id="World-Economies-suck"><a href="#World-Economies-suck" class="headerlink" title="World Economies suck "></a>World Economies suck </h2><h2></h2><p>Some of this is because world currencies are manipulated.  Right, like, should I ban everyone from third world countries the USA proxy controls and makes have shit values to their currency?  I&#x2019;m thinking no.  We just have to realize there&#x2019;s a lot more incentive for someone without running water in their home with a currency where 8 billion zimbabwebucks still doesn&#x2019;t get you an apple to game a system that can print enough USDs with just 2 votes to meet their daily income from 8 hours.  Honestly, these are teh people we want to help, but we gotta make sure they are playing fair for the sake of all the other fucked over people of the world who would like bigger or more frequent uvpotes but don&#x2019;t because they follow rules.</p>
<p>So, yeah, third worlders who look different than me are still gonna be welcome.  That&#x2019;s part of the whole Peace thing: Accepting &#x201C;the other.&#x201D;  My faith has lead me to a place where I believe we&#x2019;re all interconnected souls here.  We&#x2019;re all one being fractualized and embodied in different meat sacks.  I&#x2019;m only hurting me when I don&#x2019;t show peace, kindness, and love.  It&#x2019;s especially important when I&#x2019;m personally at risk.</p>
<h2 id="I&#x2019;m-sure-some-of-you-just-think-I&#x2019;m-getting-played-here"><a href="#I&#x2019;m-sure-some-of-you-just-think-I&#x2019;m-getting-played-here" class="headerlink" title="I&#x2019;m sure some of you just think I&#x2019;m getting played here "></a>I&#x2019;m sure some of you just think I&#x2019;m getting played here </h2><h2></h2><p>Maybe&#x2026; I hold that open as a potential, but I wouldn&#x2019;t be a good teacher if I didn&#x2019;t expose myself to some risk.  I wouldn&#x2019;t be a good leader if I flogged and banned every dipshit that makes a mistake or does the wrong thing.  I come from the judeo-christian community where forgiveness is kinda held sacred.  I&#x2019;m down with that.  I&#x2019;m an N+1 sorta person.  Show me some effort I&#x2019;ll match it and raise the stakes.  The kid seems to be trying, but has a life time of mistakes to overcome.  I want to be there to help because it&#x2019;s through each one of these one off changes that our world will eventually shift.</p>
<p>Did I want to smash his face?  Yeah.  Do I consent to that?  No.  So, I gotta do this the right way.  </p>
<h2 id="Growing-Pains"><a href="#Growing-Pains" class="headerlink" title="Growing Pains "></a>Growing Pains </h2><h2></h2><p>I continue to think that Minnow Support Project is actually doing some extraordinary things.  That we&#x2019;re doing something that actually will have positive ripples throughout the world.  I think we&#x2019;ll teach more people about peace, abundance, and liberty.  I think we&#x2019;ll help this platform grow, and I think we&#x2019;ll help it to moon. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re all gonna be rich boyz, we&#x2019;re all gonna be rich.&#x201D;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, we continue to grow, and it&#x2019;s mostly amazing and positive, we now have grown to the point where we have some bad actors, but we&#x2019;re working to clean it up and prevent it without losing our values of peace, abundance, and liberty.</p>
<p>All in all, it takes a lot of time, but this shit means the world to me.  Thanks for being on this journey with me.  Love to the Pond.</p>
<h2 id="Ocean"><a href="#Ocean" class="headerlink" title="Ocean "></a>Ocean </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m overlooking the ocean at my family reunion and I&#x2019;m going for a dip.  Responses will be delayed an hour.  Thank you for your patience.  I&#x2019;ll high five some dolphins for you.</p>
