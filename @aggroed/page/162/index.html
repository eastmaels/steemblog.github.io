<p>Hello Minnows!</p>
<p>I recently hit 900 followers and broke into the top 150 authors on Steemit. It had a lot to do with @kaylinart and @fyrstikken resteeming one of my posts. I literally jumped 550 followers within the last three weeks.  I&#x2019;m going to keep mentioning them because of how grateful I am to have had their support.  It means this project can be successful and help a lot of newbies!</p>
<p>it got me thinking&#x2026;</p>
<p><a href="https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://media3.giphy.com/media/d3mlE7uhX8KFgEmY/giphy.gif?response_id=59246ba32717ea315c1e6153" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://media3.giphy.com/media/d3mlE7uhX8KFgEmY/giphy.gif?response_id=59246ba32717ea315c1e6153</a></p>
<p>What if I could help my followers like @kaylinart and @frystikken helped me!?! It&#x2019;s pretty easy to do. All I have to do is resteem my followers!  What if I could get them a reward too!?!</p>

Make sure there are at least 3 days left on the post rewards because I&#x2019;m not going to resteem until Thursday.<br>The first resteem is the post that gets the most upvotes.<br>The second resteem is the post I think is best based on a criteria of promoting Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.<br>Third and up are based on upvotes as well.<br>Getting upvoted by bots doesn&#x2019;t count.</p>

Don&#x2019;t just leave a comment in the box with a post.  Give a quick summary, ask for a vote, and then write a post about the content and ask your followers in bulk through that post to support you and be sure to ask folks privately through chat to support you.</p>

If multiple people end up submitting I&#x2019;ll make a separate post, resteem, and award pool just for that.  This offer valid through Thursday.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m in the top 150 authors by followers.  By the time this post publishes I&#x2019;ll probably be at or past 900 followers.  This account is at $6700SP and 700 SBD.  I&#x2019;m going to invest 1 BTC worth into steem too. So, I think the account will top $10k.   I have some whales that follow and support my work.  I&#x2019;m planning a witness run for Tuesday.

I was born white, male, and upper middle class in America.  I&#x2019;ve been sent to private schools for the better part of my life.  I&#x2019;m been armed to the teeth with opportunity.  I also work my ass off as a life thing.  Within 7 years after I graduated high school I already had a PhD.  I was 25!  I graduated a liberal arts college with a science degree in 3 years, and finished graduate school in 4.  I can write, read, think, wait, and have an incredible support network.  I have full time employment that pays a decent living.  All those things combined make it so that by the time I got to this platform I had a lot of the necessary analytical skills, reading and writing ability, and work ethic to make it happen.</p>
<p>Do I think that&#x2019;s necessary?  Fuck no!  So much of school is a terrible experience.  People make it on here as self-taught artists and high school drop outs.  There&#x2019;s a ton of approaches that will work.  I&#x2019;m starting by saying I had a leg up because of my upbringing.</p>
<h2 id="How&#x2019;d-I-get-started"><a href="#How&#x2019;d-I-get-started" class="headerlink" title="How&#x2019;d I get started? "></a>How&#x2019;d I get started? </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;ve been political for years.  It always interested me.  I&#x2019;m ashamed to admit I was a Democrat for a while.  I still like a lot of the things that they stand for: Everyone should have access to health care, everyone should have access to great schools etc.  But I&#x2019;m appalled by the methods they are willing to use to acheive them, ie coercion and force.  I had my political awakening back in 2012 when I really started questioning every single official story around.  I certainly wasn&#x2019;t one of the first truthers out there, but given my background and how much folks like me have invested in the system it was a pretty big deal to push back against.  </p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve been protesting war since folks showed up at the Bush&#x2019;s ranch in Crawford TX.  I&#x2019;ve been to at least 12 different occupy rallies.  I&#x2019;ve been to Tea Party protests.  I even ran for office and got ~6,000 votes (I still lost).</p>
<p>So, when I started posting I started immediately talking about political things.  And I was willing to say some uncomfortable things.</p>
<h2 id="So-that-got-me-to-like-50-followers&#x2026;-then-what"><a href="#So-that-got-me-to-like-50-followers&#x2026;-then-what" class="headerlink" title="So, that got me to like 50 followers&#x2026; then what "></a>So, that got me to like 50 followers&#x2026; then what </h2><h2></h2><p>After getting some initial followers I had to start branching out.  I couldn&#x2019;t keep posting just political stuff.  People get put off by politics.  Hell, even some of the curation guilds on here specifically state they won&#x2019;t touch them.  So, it was becoming harder to just do those posts and expand.  I talked about this weird phenomenon called the Mandela Effect.  I started a couple creative writing endeavors.  I had some angry things to say about the way steem was being run that hurt minnows in particular.  I started doing some satire.</p>
<p>One of my favorite pieces was right during the inflation when things sucked, and @charlieshrem put out a story about how you could put steem on a credit card and live just off of steem.  I was making $0.04 on a post, so I wrote a satire article about it.</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/writing/@aggroed/satirically-yours-s1e8-how-to-die-of-starvation-while-only-using-steem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/writing/@aggroed/satirically-yours-s1e8-how-to-die-of-starvation-while-only-using-steem</a></p>
<p>It was the biggest hit I had at the time.  It was in the zeitgeist of the moment.  A popular author wrote a story.  People were struggling in the platform.  And I hit a good moment with some folks.  So, that got some play.  </p>
<p>I was trying to go back and forth between edgy, truther, consipiracy theory posts that interested me and trying to do some satire about the same things that might be more palpable for other audience members to grab a hold of.</p>
<h2 id="Raging-against-Hillary"><a href="#Raging-against-Hillary" class="headerlink" title="Raging against Hillary "></a>Raging against Hillary </h2><h2></h2><p>I think another thing that helped get me on the map was being strongly against Hillary Clinton and exposing reasons why people should be.  It was an election year.  People were interested in that.  I don&#x2019;t think politics is always enough to talk about but Trump, Bernie, and Hillary certainly caught folks attention.  So, I don&#x2019;t think it was just Hillary rage, but I think it was really capturing a moment.  I got some big bucks for a piece mocking HRC saying if she&#x2019;s elected they will rename the presidential plane to Ambulance 1.  I also got some love for a debate satire-  <a href="https://steemit.com/politics/@aggroed/satirically-yours-s1e27-republicans-furious-as-presidential-debate-moderator-lester-holt-alleged-to-have-administered" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/politics/@aggroed/satirically-yours-s1e27-republicans-furious-as-presidential-debate-moderator-lester-holt-alleged-to-have-administered</a></p>
<p>So, it wasn&#x2019;t just Hill.  It was actually about putting a funny spin on the things everyone was talking about.</p>
<h2 id="Running-a-series"><a href="#Running-a-series" class="headerlink" title="Running a series "></a>Running a series </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m a big fan of series.  I talk a lot about the Daily Show format.</p>
<p>Cue the intro<br>Funny intro bit by host<br>Bit<br>Bit<br>Interview<br>Daily dose of zen<br>Repeat for decades!</p>
<p>It was the format that really got people and kept them.  So, my creative articles were in a series, my satire is in a series, my memethenews is a series, Minnow Support Project, Aggroed&#x2019;s Antidote.  I serialized everything.</p>
<h2 id="Announce-success"><a href="#Announce-success" class="headerlink" title="Announce success "></a>Announce success </h2><h2></h2><p>This post is in part talking about success.  Sharing success often brings people in.  So, when I hit milestone I like to talk about them.  I try to include more than just &#x201C;I hit 200 followers&#x201D; and try to provide context and the struggle with it to make it personal.  So, you can find 50 follower and 200 follower posts on my wall.  People that haven&#x2019;t made it that far will pay attention.</p>
<h2 id="Talk-about-what&#x2019;s-meaningful-to-you-even-if-no-one-is-listening"><a href="#Talk-about-what&#x2019;s-meaningful-to-you-even-if-no-one-is-listening" class="headerlink" title="Talk about what&#x2019;s meaningful to you even if no one is listening "></a>Talk about what&#x2019;s meaningful to you even if no one is listening </h2><h2></h2><p>One of my first articles on here was about the Seth Rich murder.  I&#x2019;ve known since I saw the headline that was a major deal.  I think it&#x2019;s going to bring down the DNC leadership.  I think it might even crack a giant hole in the USG and mainstream things like the Clinton Body Count and Pedogate.  That first article got like 4 upvotes, but I&#x2019;ve been talking about it for 7 months.  Now, that I&#x2019;m here I think it lends some credibility to me when I&#x2019;m posting things.  I saw that and knew something was afoot, and here&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m talking about now and why you should pay attention to that.</p>
<h2 id="I-stuck-it-out"><a href="#I-stuck-it-out" class="headerlink" title="I stuck it out "></a>I stuck it out </h2><h2></h2><p>There was a period during the mass inflation where there was a new rant showing up every day talking about why they were leaving.  This platform sucks blah blah blah.  They basically didn&#x2019;t have the patience to see through the hard times.  So, they left.  Tons of new people are arriving now, and there aren&#x2019;t a lot of people that are still here posting from the low reward days.  So,  I have a leg up there too.</p>
<h2 id="Things-kept-creeping-along-and-then-I-started-paying-attention-to-people-better-at-this-than-me"><a href="#Things-kept-creeping-along-and-then-I-started-paying-attention-to-people-better-at-this-than-me" class="headerlink" title="Things kept creeping along and then I started paying attention to people better at this than me "></a>Things kept creeping along and then I started paying attention to people better at this than me </h2><h2></h2><p>I owe a lot of the growth of my page to @kaylinart.  That lady knows how to interact with her fans.  Got a lot of good posts done in a reasonable amount of time. And she has a tight following.  I wrote an article about her style that could be mimiced, and I took some turns working on it.  Because I had been interacting with her some she was kind enough to resteem the post.</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/blogging/@aggroed/tips-to-successful-steemit-posting-learning-from-kaylinart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/blogging/@aggroed/tips-to-successful-steemit-posting-learning-from-kaylinart</a></p>
<p>She&#x2019;s got an audience of 1600 people or so.  I&#x2019;ve been on a rocket course ever since. I think I&#x2019;ve doubled in size in less than a month from 450 to 900 followers.  And now that I&#x2019;m bigger it&#x2019;s easier to attract the attention of other well known bloggers.  We&#x2019;re all incentived to get along and share one another&#x2019;s posts.  So I&#x2019;ve lucked out and gotten a few resteems from some follower-whales.  That to me is the biggest deal.</p>
<p>I think @curie picked up a few of my stories and I made a few bucks from them, but I&#x2019;ll take a big resteem over bucks any day.  Resteem leads to followers which is long term sustainable.  No one really cares that much if my account value goes up another 50.</p>
<h2 id="Mission-Driven-to-help-others-through-this-without-taking-9-months"><a href="#Mission-Driven-to-help-others-through-this-without-taking-9-months" class="headerlink" title="Mission Driven to help others through this without taking 9 months "></a>Mission Driven to help others through this without taking 9 months </h2><h2></h2><p>So, now I&#x2019;m on a mission to help other people succeed as fast or faster than me, and hopefully without needing the background I came with.  I&#x2019;m literally trying to pave a path on this platform to make it easier for those who come after me.  That&#x2019;s what my Minnow Support Project is all about, and that&#x2019;s what my witness run will focus on.</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/minnowsupportproject/@aggroed/minnow-support-project-weekly-minnow-resteem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/minnowsupportproject/@aggroed/minnow-support-project-weekly-minnow-resteem</a></p>
<h2 id="By-the-Numbers"><a href="#By-the-Numbers" class="headerlink" title="By the Numbers "></a>By the Numbers </h2><h2></h2><p>Ok, So, in the last 9 days I have 39 posts.<br>They total just under $1500.<br>They average $37.<br>Two of them are over $100.<br>Eight of them are between $50-100.<br>22 Are under $25.</p>
<p>18 of them are geared toward helping others on the platfrom.<br>21 are about news, politics, humor, or satire.</p>
<p>The highest has 460 upvotes.  It also has the most comments at 160 (maybe 60 are replies from me).<br>The lowest has 20 upvotes.</p>
<p>Before these last ten days I had maybe 5-6 posts with over 100 votes.  I&#x2019;ve gotten that many just in the last 10 days.  </p>
<p>So, I&#x2019;m still not super consistent.  I think it&#x2019;s because I&#x2019;m uncompromising on talking about some things that still no one cares about, but it&#x2019;s important to me.  Eventually, people will pick them up too, or they won&#x2019;t.  I still think it&#x2019;s fascinating, so I&#x2019;m not changing direction on things like my Hard Times Series as I have time or the Mandela Effect posts as I find new ones.</p>
<h2 id="Anyway-that&#x2019;s-my-journey"><a href="#Anyway-that&#x2019;s-my-journey" class="headerlink" title="Anyway, that&#x2019;s my journey "></a>Anyway, that&#x2019;s my journey </h2><h2></h2><p>And hopefully, if things go according to plan, I&#x2019;ll make it easier for you to follow it than it was for me to blaze it.  Thanks for following, thanks for interacting with me, and hopefully these kinds of posts can help you grow your page and learn from what worked for me.</p>

        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I just broke into the top 150 most followed authors and I&#x2019;m setting my sights still higher.  I have a burning need to spread the message of peace, abundance, and liberty with people.  </p>
<p>I have 2 daughters and I don&#x2019;t want blue gloved TSA agents touching their privates when we fly to see the grand parents, I don&#x2019;t want health care keeping them sick while offering medicines with endless side effects, and I don&#x2019;t consent to the constant war, theft, lies, and other forms of violence waged against us by the powers that be nor do I want my daughters to live under this same system or a worse one as corruption infects more of it.  </p>
<p>My number 1 fear is that one day my daughters will figure out how the ruling elite cause so much harm.  They&#x2019;ll ask me &#x201C;Did you know about this?  What did you do about it?&#x201D; and I&#x2019;m terrified my answer won&#x2019;t be good enough.  At the same time so much of my family has died to cancer.  I think cancer is preventable, harmlessly detectable, and treatable.  So, the policies of this elite group have killed my mother, two uncles, two aunts, injured my father, and in all likelihood will eventually kill me.  </p>
<p>I&#x2019;m not going anywhere.  This world has to change, and that change has to start with me.  I have message, and I&#x2019;m looking at how will that message spread.</p>
<p>So, as I&#x2019;m looking at the top 25 accounts on Steemwhales.com I&#x2019;m trying to figure out how they got there.  It&#x2019;s a great website with tons of data.  Here are SIX ways that authors stood out and how they were able to make it on the list.  These are listed like they are separate, but make no mistake the authors I&#x2019;m going to list cross across the artificial boundaries I&#x2019;m making.  I suppose I could make a rubric and artificially rank them all based on personal feeling, but I&#x2019;m trying to keep this simple&#x2026;<br><img src="https://steemwhales.com/pic/whale.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s the list of authors ranked by number of followers-<br><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmPrbbcj2T9oYnqcdSwew7LYzi43nsR5actv2UuMX7Kcb7/image.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="1-You&#x2019;re-famous-and-you-bring-and-share-an-audience-here"><a href="#1-You&#x2019;re-famous-and-you-bring-and-share-an-audience-here" class="headerlink" title="1.  You&#x2019;re famous and you bring and share an audience here. "></a>1.  You&#x2019;re famous and you bring and share an audience here. </h2><h2></h2><p>@dollarvigilante is a great example of this, and it&#x2019;s no wonder he&#x2019;s in the top spot.  With over 5k followers people flocked to him.  His success on Steemit looked like it was an overnight success, but for people that don&#x2019;t know he&#x2019;s been in the space for a few decades.  That said, you work at this for 20 years and you&#x2019;re likely to snag an audience.  The message he shares resonates pretty well over here and with all that synergy, BOOM, an overnight success on this platform.  Just makes me scared for the day when someone like Kim Kardashian finds her way over here with all her fans.</p>
<h2 id="2-A-healthy-dose-of-personality-and-community-building"><a href="#2-A-healthy-dose-of-personality-and-community-building" class="headerlink" title="2.  A healthy dose of personality and community building. "></a>2.  A healthy dose of personality and community building. </h2><h2></h2><p>@always1success, @instructor2121, @joanaltres, @fyrstikken, @carlobelgado are great examples of community building.  They broke steemwhales in a sense.  Many of these people aren&#x2019;t following 2,000 people.  They are following 20,000 people.  They represent 1-person curation armies.  They take in a crap ton of information from thousands of posts and resteem the things that they value in.  @fyrsikken doesn&#x2019;t only post and interact on steemit.  He&#x2019;s got the discord channel, supports projects, invests in people, and builds community on and off steemit.  These folks are the lifeblood of the community.</p>
<h2 id="3-You-do-something-amazing-and-people-know-of-your-work"><a href="#3-You-do-something-amazing-and-people-know-of-your-work" class="headerlink" title="3.  You do something amazing and people know of your work. "></a>3.  You do something amazing and people know of your work. </h2><h2></h2><p>@ned, @dantheman, @charlieshrem, @blocktrades are great examples of this.  Ned and Dan built steemit, which this whole community is benefitting from.  @charlieshrem was rocking Silk Road and took a hit and kept on ticking.  His story is inspiring.  @blocktrades is one of the foundations of crypto!  If you want to get noticed build something amazing and share your insights.  People will follow this kind of greatness, genius, and perseverance.  </p>
<h2 id="4-You-post-like-crazy-and-grind-it-out"><a href="#4-You-post-like-crazy-and-grind-it-out" class="headerlink" title="4.  You post like crazy and grind it out. "></a>4.  You post like crazy and grind it out. </h2><h2></h2><p>@thecryptofiend, @doitvoluntarily, @pappa-pepper are all examples of this.  These three authors have roughly as many posts as the other 22 on the list combined.  The phrase of the day here is success is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration.  I just crossed 1k posts.  I know how many hours it&#x2019;s taken me to get here.  These guys are writing stories, commenting on other posts, and communicating with followers on their own posts as full time work.  If you want to make it to the top you may have to out work these guys so clear your calendar for say the next 2 decades.</p>
<h2 id="5-You&#x2019;re-an-amazing-author-and-people-love-your-work"><a href="#5-You&#x2019;re-an-amazing-author-and-people-love-your-work" class="headerlink" title="5.  You&#x2019;re an amazing author and people love your work.  "></a>5.  You&#x2019;re an amazing author and people love your work.  </h2><h2></h2><p>@hilarski, @heiditravels, @sirwinchester, @stellabelle.  I personally resonate with the work @sirwinchester is doing.  I look forward to the posts.  I look forward to reading the stories.  They are visual, well written, easy to read, mission driven, and seem to come from a good heart space.  What&#x2019;s not to like.  It&#x2019;s the same with this whole group.  Talented writers finding a niche that cross entertainment, purpose, and something that gets people thinking.  It&#x2019;s no wonder they have an audience!</p>
<h2 id="6-You-provide-a-service-that-the-community-values"><a href="#6-You-provide-a-service-that-the-community-values" class="headerlink" title="6.  You provide a service that the community values "></a>6.  You provide a service that the community values </h2><h2></h2><p>@marketreport @curie @steemitblog.  If you&#x2019;re looking for crypto finance, some great new reads, or the latest on the innerworkings of steemit then look no further.  These authors provide information that the community wants hand delivered to them.  Do you want to spend hours finding the best gems and new stories by virutally unknown authors?  No, that&#x2019;s ok @curie is there to help you!  Provide a service and people will follow.  </p>
<h2 id="So-where-will-I-land-How-will-I-get-there"><a href="#So-where-will-I-land-How-will-I-get-there" class="headerlink" title="So, where will I land?  How will I get there? "></a>So, where will I land?  How will I get there? </h2><h2></h2><p>I think I&#x2019;ll rock out a combination (just like the above authors do).  I want to provide a service for new authors through my Minnow Support Project and STEEMIT TIPS series.  I want to write great articles that people smile and laugh as they read or scratch their head as they think about the posts hours after they&#x2019;ve read them.  I want to do great things like support natestate and help purchase the first house with steemit and it&#x2019;s community.  Lastly, I want to build community.  This world isn&#x2019;t going to change just by one person acting alone.  I want to help connect people and link hands with other that envision a world filled with Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  Maybe you&#x2019;ll be one!</p>

<p>Steemwhales is a day behind, but based on what I&#x2019;m seeing I just moved into the 150th most followed author spot.  85 more followers and I&#x2019;m in the top 100.  At this rate it should be about a week from now.  It&#x2019;s a dream coming true and a lot of hard work going into a ton of posts.  Don&#x2019;t wake me up out of it.</p>

            <p>I present to you three points that counter some of the common logic that I&#x2019;ve heard recently.  Many have presented BTCC as a loss, that the crash in crypto price is horrible, and somewhat off topic people believe Daniel is the hero of the Karate Kid movies.</p>

<h2 id="Let&#x2019;s-break-those-down"><a href="#Let&#x2019;s-break-those-down" class="headerlink" title="Let&#x2019;s break those down "></a>Let&#x2019;s break those down </h2><h2></h2><p>I have a sense of what you&#x2019;re going to say here.  Technically speaking we lost the BTCC poll.<br><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmf77WRsnLsus7hkpcavzPTQSkMdMpm8hqiJgwNqtnz7dz/image.png" alt=""><br>But look at those stats.  ~76,000 people voted for Steemit!  That&#x2019;s huge.  That&#x2019;s 12-13x our weekly user base.  It you gives you a sense of just how many people use this currency and like this platform.  That&#x2019;s not even everyone.  That&#x2019;s the people that knew about the contest, and those that aren&#x2019;t more invested in the other currencies.  In the multiple rounds this platform beat out altcoins that have been around longer and have a pretty dedicated user base.</p>
<p><a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fi2.kym-cdn.com%2Fphotos%2Fimages%2Fnewsfeed%2F000%2F661%2F508%2F4a6.jpg&amp;f=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fi2.kym-cdn.com%2Fphotos%2Fimages%2Fnewsfeed%2F000%2F661%2F508%2F4a6.jpg&amp;f=1</a></p>
<p>So, I&#x2019;m aware we didn&#x2019;t come in first place, but not only did this place rally like crazy we also got some great exposure.  We went through multiple rounds of voting, beat out other coins (and in that process got exposed to other coins), and when they run the contest again we&#x2019;ll be in a great spot to win!  Which actually is a good segway to the next point!</p>

<p>This is a trading term that translates to &#x201C;Buy the Fucking Dip!&#x201D;  Crypto is going through an expansion.  Lots of people called it a bubble, but that&#x2019;s not accurate.  When the price of 1 BTC went above 1oz of Gold people started freaking out and rethinking crypto in their portfolio.  Add to that US dollar printing reaches $160M a day while there&#x2019;s only of fraction of that per year for most of the major alt coins and investors start seeing powerful deflationary coins rather than inflation.  More people started buying them and using them.  Ultimately this is a good thing, and the price will steadily rise as a result.  This is just a hiccup.</p>
<p>You&#x2019;ve been told economies need inflation.  If we don&#x2019;t have inflation things will be terrible.  In this case it just means that the same amount of coins is being used by more people, but the same amount of goods and services are being created and traded, and so you need less coins to purchase it.  That isn&#x2019;t bad if you already held the coins!!!</p>
<p>The bankers need inflation.  They need it because they have leveraged themselves out 14-50x.  If money deflates it means they have to pay back more than what they borrowed and then multiple that by how much they are leveraged.  No, the mantra put out by the bankers publicists on the finance talk shows is in support of their decisions and not what is in our benefit.</p>
<p>Back in the day the price of a computer was like a $1M.  It took up a whole room.  Now it&#x2019;s a couple hundred dollars and the size of loaf of bread.  Are you freaking out about that?  Has that ruined your life?  That&#x2019;s a deflationary trend, but like a lot of other deflationary trends it was actually good for consumers!!!</p>
<p>So, I&#x2019;m not freaking out about the correction.  People got worked up, bought too much for right this second, and the price came back down, but as long as there&#x2019;s an assload of inflation in government fiat and practically speaking none in crypto the value of my coins are going up while the value of my Fed Reserve Notes are declining!!!  I&#x2019;m going to buy more crypto.</p>
