<p>Quick side note, I passed 1600 Witness votes.  That feels pretty amazing.  Thank you for the support that keeps rolling in.  It&#x2019;s very challenging to run a large para-volunteer organization like I do.  It&#x2019;s exceptionally rewarding, and getting paid as a Witness helps.  It&#x2019;s also cool to be able to get new communities off the ground and support them using delegated SP that I earn from being a witness and I&#x2019;ll write up more about that soon.  Thanks for your support.</p>
<h2 id="The-Work"><a href="#The-Work" class="headerlink" title="The Work "></a>The Work </h2><h2></h2><p>Yesterday I did &#x201C;The Work&#x201D; on a number of less difficult fears that I was facing.  You can find the post here: <a href="https://steemit.com/thework/@aggroed/the-work-by-katie-byron-applied-by-aggroed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/thework/@aggroed/the-work-by-katie-byron-applied-by-aggroed</a></p>
<p>Today, I&#x2019;m going to work on some questions that are substantially harder for me so you can see what those might look like too.  </p>
<p>Disclaimer: It is possible that if you&#x2019;re extremely emotionally fragile and raw to the point where you can&#x2019;t look inward these may not be appropriate activities.</p>
<h2 id="I&#x2019;m-a-bad-son"><a href="#I&#x2019;m-a-bad-son" class="headerlink" title="I&#x2019;m a bad son "></a>I&#x2019;m a bad son </h2><h2></h2><p>My mother was diagnosed with cancer.  It progressed.  She eventually had it leak into her brain.  The cancer in her brain eventually caused her to have a stroke.  The stroke led to bleeding in her skull and it looked like it was going to kill her.  My brother was in another country leading a trip, which to me looked like he was in complete denial of her death.  My father was divorced from her and wasn&#x2019;t really available on this one.  I had estranged my wife.  I couldn&#x2019;t reach my uncle.  It was just me in a hospital, late at night, being asked the question &#x201C;Do you want us to operate?&#x201D; and knowing some of my mother&#x2019;s wishes I said &#x201C;No.&#x201D;  I knew full well that would let her die.</p>
<p>Good news.  She didn&#x2019;t die that night.  She survived the bleeding and the stroke for another month (she was able to die on my father&#x2019;s anniversary with his new wife, which I&#x2019;m sure she struggled to make happen).  But without a doubt it&#x2019;s left with questions/fears like &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a bad son&#x201D; or  &#x201C;I was willing to make a decision I knew would lead to her death.  I&#x2019;m a horrible person.&#x201D;</p>
<p>So, let&#x2019;s break those down.</p>
<h2 id="The-4-Questions"><a href="#The-4-Questions" class="headerlink" title="The 4 Questions "></a>The 4 Questions </h2><h2></h2><ol>
<li>Is it true? (Yes or no. If no, move to 3.)</li>
<li>Can you absolutely know that it&#x2019;s true? (Yes or no.)</li>
<li>How do you react, what happens, when you believe that thought?</li>
<li>Who would you be without the thought?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="The-4-questions-specific-to-me-and-my-fears"><a href="#The-4-questions-specific-to-me-and-my-fears" class="headerlink" title="The 4 questions specific to me and my fears"></a>The 4 questions specific to me and my fears</h2><h2></h2><ol>
<li>Is it true you are a horrible person and a bad son?<blockquote>
<p>Man, well, sometimes it really feels that way, but I guess I&#x2019;d make a distinction between I&#x2019;ve done horrible things, I&#x2019;ve hurt people I&#x2019;ve loved, and I know I&#x2019;ve caused people a lot of harm.  At the same time I&#x2019;m working to make the world a better place, and share love and friendship to the best of my abilities while doing my best to honor values that should reduce harm in the world and specifically harm sourced from me.  So, no, it&#x2019;s not true that I&#x2019;m a horrible person.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I also know that my mom loved me more than any other person on this planet (with possible exception my brother).  So, I couldn&#x2019;t have been the worst son ever.  Her last conscious act was to share how much she loved my brother and I.  I know I hurt her with some of the conversations I had with her, but that doesn&#x2019;t make me a horrible son.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Can I absolutely know that I&#x2019;m a horrible person and a bad son?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technically I can skip this because I figured out on the first pass I&#x2019;m not a horrible person and a bad son.  But it&#x2019;s worth re-emphasizing through the use of absolutes.  There&#x2019;s not an absolute gauge for good or bad.  You can do bad things and still be ok.  You can do good things and still be a bad person.  I can say I&#x2019;ve done bad things, but I can&#x2019;t absolutely say I&#x2019;m horrible or a bad son.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>How do I react when when I think I&#x2019;m a horrible person or bad son?  What happens when I have that thought?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I think I let down my mom, who loved me more than just about any other person I&#x2019;ve seen try, I am crestfallen.  I feel depressed.  I feel like I let someone down who I cared deeply for.  It leaves me feeling raw and vulnerable.  It leaves me thinking I&#x2019;m worthless.  When I think that I was willing to let my mother die, especially because of how much she loved me, and I let the fear settle in that I&#x2019;m horrible because of it;  it opens up a giant pit of despair in my heart.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3a. The turnaround.  I&#x2019;m not a horrible person or a bad son.<br>How do I react when I think I&#x2019;m not a horrible person or bad son?  What happens when I have that thought?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first thing that happens is my chest expands and the restriction around my heart weakens.  I can breath deeper.  I feel relieved.  I think about how it was my mom&#x2019;s wish that we didn&#x2019;t revive her and I remember that she didn&#x2019;t actually die that night.  I stop holding myself accountable for a fear for a thing that didn&#x2019;t happen.<br> I remember the fact that the very last conscious act she did before she died was to take my hand and my brothers hand and raise them up.  She was lying in her hospice bed.  We were on either side of her letting her know we loved her, and through her fog of cancer and death, and without the ability to speak she raised my arm and my brother&#x2019;s as high up as she could.  That&#x2019;s the the last thing she&#x2019;d consciously do on this planet and she showed us she loved us.  And I was there for that, and I was there for her, and I loved her the best I could at the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Who would I be without that thought (fear)?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I can open up to love more freely.  I can be loved without the fear that I&#x2019;ll cause the other person harm.  I don&#x2019;t have to shrink from facing that anymore because I know I did the best I humanly could and it was enough for her and it was enough for me.  I feel stronger, and released.</p>

            <p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmVkwv3zhLY8Xai7RdsjKPWzs7LhNbw4h8JMGCBZfJMKyX/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, when there&#x2019;s personal conflict there is exactly one place I turn to deal with it.  A woman by the name of Katie Byron put together 4 questions that you ask yourself in a series in order to flesh out what the fear is, how it effects you, and who you would be without it.  By answering those questions honestly and openly it seems to have the power (at least for me) to unlock the fears the grip me.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve been working with various people in the Minnow Support Project to help them deal with their conflicts by teaching them about, and helping them apply those questions.  I have both postive and negative feedback on the approach, but overall there&#x2019;s nothing that I can recommend more.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s generally two types of fears.  Those we put on others and those we put on ourselves.  When we&#x2019;re constantly lashing out at people, especially those that haven&#x2019;t really committed major offenses, it&#x2019;s usually that we&#x2019;re letting ourselves down and taking it out on the other.  Many people also bury themselves in negative self talk all day long.  With some of my friends that I&#x2019;m working on this with they can&#x2019;t make it through a three sentence paragraph without sharing two giant fears and insecurities.</p>
<p>So, as part of this I was asked to do the same activity, I said I would and here&#x2019;s the first post.  I have two questions that came from others that to me having done this for a few years are pretty easy to cope with.  So, I&#x2019;ll start there.  Tomorrow or the next day I&#x2019;ll really bare all on some fuckers that still haunt me to show how someone that&#x2019;s kinda an expert at this deals with the monster insecurities that still exist.  For now though, let&#x2019;s do these two.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-The-Work-&#x201D;"><a href="#What-is-The-Work-&#x201D;" class="headerlink" title="What is The Work?&#x201D;"></a>What is The Work?&#x201D;</h2><p>There are two extremes that I witness a fair amount.  On the one hand you are brutal to yourself:  &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not loveable.&#x201D;  &#x201C;I&#x2019;m worthless.&#x201D; &#x201C;I&#x2019;m such a fucking asshole.&#x201D; &#x201C; I can&#x2019;t do anything right.&#x201D; &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a monster.&#x201D;  On the other hand you are brutal to someone else:  &#x201C;You&#x2019;re not loveable.&#x201D; &#x201C;You&#x2019;re worthless.&#x201D;  &#x201C;You&#x2019;re such a fucking asshole.&#x201D;  &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t do anything right.&#x201D;  &#x201C;You&#x2019;re a monster.&#x201D;</p>
<p>These oscillate between guilt/shame and accusation.  Often times the worst of your fears are causing additional problems rather than helping you.  So, you have be able to hold a thought, examine it, but not believe everything you think.  That&#x2019;s part of Wisdom.  Here&#x2019;s a tool to help you do it.  It&#x2019;s called &#x201C;The Work&#x201D; and consists of asking isolating a fear you are experiencing and then asking yourself 4 questions about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Four Questions</p>
<ol>

<h2 id="Aggroed-avoids-central-questions"><a href="#Aggroed-avoids-central-questions" class="headerlink" title="Aggroed avoids central questions "></a>Aggroed avoids central questions </h2><h2></h2><p>The first question I was asked to write about is regarding me avoiding central questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>&#x201C;I avoid central questions&#x201D; <blockquote>
<p>No I don&#x2019;t.  I delay them for input, but I don&#x2019;t avoid them.  I may avoid them when they are small, but I don&#x2019;t when stakes are large.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>How do I react when I avoid central questions?  What happens when I avoid central Questions?<blockquote>
<p>I react in fear to avoid causing irrepairable harm.  Rather than immedately following my gut, I question myself and if I have enough information.  I seek more out.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Who would I be without the fear that I avoid central questions?<blockquote>
<p>I would make faster decisions knowing that I&#x2019;m good at leading and can trust my instincts more.  I may seek less input and spend be able to draw conclusions faster.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Turned around; I don&#x2019;t avoid central questions.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This feels truer to me.  I feel like I purposefully go slow, but that&#x2019;s hardly ignoring them.  I want to do a good job.  People count on me.</p>
<p>I still feel freer here.  I&#x2019;m in the drivers seat, and I can make conscientious decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="If-I-make-decisions-that-my-dear-friends-don&#x2019;t-like-they-will-abandon-me"><a href="#If-I-make-decisions-that-my-dear-friends-don&#x2019;t-like-they-will-abandon-me" class="headerlink" title="If I make decisions that my dear friends don&#x2019;t like they will abandon me "></a>If I make decisions that my dear friends don&#x2019;t like they will abandon me </h2><h2></h2><p>So, the first fear wasn&#x2019;t mine.  So, it&#x2019;s hard to address someone else&#x2019;s fear.  Maybe the first one was a little awkward.  So, that&#x2019;s why I felt it was important to add another one in here that&#x2019;s my lil&#x2019; fear baby.  So, let&#x2019;s try it now.</p>
<p>If I make decisions that my dear friends don&#x2019;t like they will abandon me.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Is it true.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe?  If my decisions are bad enough and I hurt a lot of people they might?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Can I absolutely know that it&#x2019;s true?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, even if I make a horrible decision it&#x2019;s probably as likely or more that people will intervene to set my course straight rather than simply abandon me.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>How do I react when I think people will abandon me for making bad decisions?  What happens when I think they will abandon me?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, first I get scared.   I don&#x2019;t want the friends that I&#x2019;ve worked hard to collect and care for to suddenly disappear.  It&#x2019;s happened before in my life and it was painful.  So, I resist the urge to do something or anything immediately.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Who would I be without the thought that people will abandon me for making bad decisions?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>My answers to this tend to come back to liberty.  I&#x2019;ll be free of a constraint that holds my answers in my gut and on my tounge.  I&#x2019;ll still want to deliberate and check in with others, but I could trust my instincts more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3a. Reworked- If I make a bad decision I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;ll abandon my friends.<br>How do I feel when I think this?  How do I react?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#x2019;m filled with some shame.  I&#x2019;ve failed plenty of times in my life.  I&#x2019;ve had lots of success too, but there are times that the strees or pressure has gotten too high and I&#x2019;ve had to bail out especially to the detriment of others.  Sometimes I&#x2019;ll turn to drugs, alcohol, or video games, other times I&#x2019;ll just keep putting it out of mind and off for more time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who would I be if I weren&#x2019;t gripped by this thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I create powerful friendships.  The people that know me well know I love them and will stand by them.  I don&#x2019;t have to be afraid that I&#x2019;ll bail because they matter so much to me.  I think I could face the challenges more easily and not be gripped by uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3b.  I won&#x2019;t abandon my friends if I make a bad decision<br>How do I react when I read this?  How happens to me when I have this thought?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel empowered.  I feel it in my heart that you don&#x2019;t leave people behind that are struggling as long as they are trying.  It makes me feel more committeed to helping my buddies because I know I won&#x2019;t fail them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4b.  Who would I be if I felt this way?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#x2019;d be a better leader.  I&#x2019;d trust myself to always keep the watch and make sure I stick by their side.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s a pleasure to share a special guest with you all today. I have the great honor of having @gtg (also known as @gandalf) speak a few words with us about the Steem blockchain. @gtg can often be found as the number 1 Witness on Steem and is well known for his technical skills as an IT wizard, system administrator, and developer. I&#x2019;ve been following a story for a little bit about how the Steem Blockchain application is working, and I want to address some concerns about it&#x2019;s ultimate fate.  </p>
<p>While the website is called Steemit the blockchain program is called <code>steemd</code>.  When you blog on steemit.com, the website is actually pulling data from and pushing data to the blockchain through <code>steemd</code>. Steemit.com is basically a fairly convenient looking glass for what&#x2019;s written on the actual blocks, which is Steem. The program that powers steemit.com to look at the material on the blockchain is called <code>condenser</code>.  All the witnesses are running servers that store the information written into the Blockchain and it&#x2019;s our witness servers that build what you write and do as new blocks on the blockchain.</p>
<p>A few weeks back several of the larger RPC nodes, which are used by developers to run programs off of Steemd (not just for reading/writing blogs) crashed on the same day, and the witnesses and community were alarmed, annoyed at the loss of various bots, programs, and tools, and lastly concerned about the future of the Blockchain.  While the programs didn&#x2019;t cease to exist, many were temporarily disabled as they may not have been configured to go to backup nodes or re-establish connections after a loss, or the nodes they chose to re-establish connections to were also down.  Anyway, a lot of community members voiced concerns on the block.</p>
<p>In part, the severity of the concern at the time was caused by the account l0k1 who was writing about the immanent death of Steemd due to increasing RAM storage requirements that will eventually cause the program to shutdown.  (l0ki also goes by the handles elfspice and calibrae, they were joined by the additional account faddat).  It&#x2019;s worth noting they were simultaneously promoting their own blockchain application at the time.   @gtg responded then and has been working hard on the backend to minimize some requirements and also calm fears.  This article is designed to offer more clarity on the strength of the Steem blockchain, ecosystem, and the witnesses and developers behind it.</p>
<hr>
<p>@gtg, can you state what happened in your opinion on the day that many of the full RPC nodes shut down?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#x2019;s not what happened in my opinion. It&#x2019;s just what happened :-)</p>
<p>One of my nodes was affected too. I remember that moment exactly. I was at the Warsaw Steem Meetup. <a href="/@zurvanic">Mitchell</a> was giving his great speech, while I was looking at incoming alerts from my node.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve collected useful data from that crash and sent them to Steemit dev team. Just after 69 minutes I received the first feedback and 25 minutes after that there was a complete, detailed description of the cause along with solution proposal.</p>
<p>The outage was caused by a bug in the tags plugin. Full RPC nodes run a number of non-consensus plugins to support various frontend features for condenser (<a href="https://steemit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steemit.com</a> is powered by <a href="https://github.com/steemit/condenser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">condenser</a>) and other apps.</p>
<p>These plugins are not as robustly tested as the consensus logic. The blockchain itself and other types of nodes like seed nodes, witness nodes, exchange nodes, etc. were unaffected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>@gtg, do you think that those nodes are likely to keep running into the same problem?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No. It is fixed now.</p>
<p>Of course like with every software new issues might appear in the future but with such an awesome community and filled with skilled developers I&#x2019;m sure they would be quickly addressed and fixed. That&#x2019;s how it works now (I&#x2019;ve experienced it myself), but in a long term it would be even better.</p>
<p>If you are paying attention on what changes are being made to the platform infrastructure you might notice that there are upcomming new features that will allow migration of the plugins functionality to services external to <code>steemd</code>. For steem powered service providers it would be a great improvement. It would not only let you use specialized data backends to deal with whatever functionality you need (graphs? sql? full text searches?) but also, in future if there were a similar bug, then only a specified service and a subset of frontend functionality would be affected until it&#x2019;s fixed and there would be no need to touch <code>steemd</code>.  This is a great upcoming improvement overall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>@gtg, for many witnesses a full node used to take under 100g of RAM on a server, and now without setting up unique configurations take over 100G of RAM.  You&#x2019;ve recently stated that you can run a full RPC node under 64G of RAM.  What&#x2019;s the financial impact of being able to run on a smaller system, and how are you able to do it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For full node it is crucial to provide very fast access to the shared memory file. Low latency is the key. There&#x2019;s no need to keep whole file in RAM, but if portions of it are not there, they need to be quickly accessed. Using <code>tmpfs</code> is a very effective way to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>When I get enough time I will write a post about my node setup.<br>I used to (until recently) run my public full node on a machine with 32GB RAM, and I moved out not because of a slow performance or lack of RAM but because of something more trivial: running out of disk space (no option to add it for reasonable price to that config).</p>
<p>Please note, that hardware costs to run a node is just a very small factor of a total cost of running a public service. This is not a Steem specific, it&#x2019;s how things work in a real system administration and programming world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>@gtg, How do you see technology evolving here?  It seems you&#x2019;re using a combination of storage devices in conjunction with RAM, do you think this is going to be a long term stable approach to scaling Steemit to millions of users in addition to the hundreds of thousands of accounts we have now?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With current approach we can scale 100x easily and there are ongoing optimizations that would help going beyond that. As for hardware resources, for example <code>i3.2xlarge</code> on Amazon EC2 is not only a good way to go as for now but has a lot potential to handle future growth.</p>
<p>Of course there are many challenges that need to be addressed, and fortunately they can be addressed ahead of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>@gtg, last question, @followbtcnews (and @crimsonclad) just started the steemd.minnowsupportproject.org RPC node.  Any tricks you can share with us to reduce it&#x2019;s requirements?  How can the other witnesses learn and repeat the success that you&#x2019;re having?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All depends on your needs. My goal is to provide a service for general use, with all reasonable features. As I already mentioned using <code>tmpfs</code> for shared memory file is an effective method for keeping low latency access without need to have huge amounts of RAM.</p>
<p>For that to work you need a fast storage for swap space and other assets like the <code>block_log</code>.</p>
<p>Replaying the Steem blockchain is a really demanding process when it comes to I/O, but once the reindex is done, load on storage would be significantly lower.</p>
<p>For production grade infrastructure environment, you might consider preparing snapshot of a consistent blockchain state (shared memory file and <code>block_log</code> with index) on a separate instance and deliver it to your public instance for faster turnaround.</p>

<p>It seems that I have stumbled into an endless pit of rage,<br>At first it was observer mode, but now I think engage,<br>For a few score weeks I thought &#x201C;Oh no, this surely is not swell.&#x201D;<br>It seems that I have changed my tune, &#x201C;Tonight we dine in hell!&#x201D;<br>And so my friends I looked upon the mighty cavernous wall;<br>I dived right in straight head first and now I&#x2019;m in free fall!</p>
<p>Flying down the cavern is actually a wondrous  gaffaw<br>My life will flash before my eyes and now I watch in awe.<br>Moments long buried that seemed quite dead in distant past<br>Have sprung back to life all zombie like alive again at last<br>Not every vision&#x2019;s horror some some seem dear and true<br>My children&#x2019;s birth, my PhD, the day we said &#x201C;I do.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I wonder how this got here as at times the cinema stops.<br>Long black outs lasting years cover exuberant personal flops.<br>But the craziest thing that happened as I&#x2019;m skydiving in your rage<br>I looked straight down and saw YOU HERE.  You&#x2019;re trapped too; encaged.<br>Like Gandolf and the Balrog we plummet in emotional fight<br>We&#x2019;ll smash the world and break the home so long as you&#x2019;re not right.</p>
<p>But something inside me wiggles that make me think some more<br>I&#x2019;d like to find a nice way out, I wonder if there&#x2019;s a door?<br>Rather than defeat you, I&#x2019;d rather take your hand<br>I&#x2019;ll fall along beside you, your best friend, and your man.<br>I do recall a another time, I&#x2019;ve fallen, but for big eyes deep and blue<br>In every way I&#x2019;ve been falling since I laid eyes on you.</p>
<p>My dearest are you in there?  My dearest are you here?<br>Don&#x2019;t lash out, I don&#x2019;t consent, but I lay aside my fear.<br>I&#x2019;m sorry for the many times and ways that I failed to treat you well<br>This life has surly been obscene to me, and/but you have been my shell.<br>But miracles can happen, <em>I</em> stand to here to attest.<br>I see that things lay broken here, but you have loved me best.</p>
<p>If you could kindly stop your swinging to rip off my throat and balls,<br>I know I deserve each and everyone, but before this curtain calls&#x2026;<br>I have a vision of our home with you and me and kids<br>Happy, smiling, laughter, play, alive again like this.<br>I&#x2019;ve asked before, I&#x2019;ll ask again, despite the odds I see,<br>Take my hand, let&#x2019;s find yourself, and then once more &#x201C;Please marry me?&#x201D;</p>

<p>I love you buddy.  We&#x2019;ll figure it out.</p>

<p>When you&#x2019;re a parent you know better than to love one kid more than another.  Sometimes they love you more than the other parent, but that&#x2019;s different.  One of my favorite quotes in the world I believe to be an anonymous quote, but I saw this while wandering the halls looking for sales on a University campus &#x201C;Love is asymmetric.  Men love women.  Women love their kids.  Kids love butterflies.&#x201D;  In the right mood I&#x2019;m laughing and crying at the same time to that.</p>
<p>Anyway, I know I&#x2019;m supposed to be impartial in leading MSP, but I have to make a total exception here.  I love Kubby.  She&#x2019;s amazing.  She has energy for days.  She is kind.  She is thoughtful.  She is inquisitive.  She&#x2019;s adorbs.  She&#x2019;s funny.  She&#x2019;s charming.  She&#x2019;s a constant source of joy for me.  If my daughters grow up to be like Kubby I&#x2019;ll be one of the happiest dad&#x2019;s in the world (already am!!!).</p>
<p>Kubby, you make me smile on bad days.  You make me laugh just about every day.  I feel appreciated and welcome when you&#x2019;re around.  I am grateful to see you when you&#x2019;re here.  Thanks for being my buddy.  Thanks for being a mod.</p>
<p>So, at this point it should be clear that it&#x2019;s my heartfelt pleasure to introduce you to Kubby Elizabeth aka Muh KUBBY!!!!</p>

<p>When did you hear about the MSP?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@kubbyelizabeth: I heard of MSP through Scaredycat a couple of days after joining. So, sometime late June or early July.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why did you join the MSP?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@kubbyelizabeth: I joined MSP because a friend invited me. Like many before me, I came to meet people and network. At first it was all about spamming people to upvote my posts. I quickly learned it was a lot more effective to not do that. With all the competitions going on, it was more fun to give than to receive. I love going into Discord and promoting my friends posts and contests. It is so much fun to surprise others with SP and SBD. I make it my mission to always win. Win for those that lose, win for those that feel left out, win for those that haven&#x2019;t figured it out. MSP- where we join together to give to those we value for their efforts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you think is the best aspect of the MSP?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@kubbyelizabeth: The best aspect of MSP are the moderators and witnesses. They are gems. So talented, so funny, and so loving. They know so much about the platform and want others to thrive in it. They spend every day, multiple hours a day ensuring someone has benefited from MSP. They are what we stand for and are the reason we thrive every day. I hope to learn their ways and be as positive of an influence as they. My second favorite aspect are all the radio shows we have. Anyone who hasn&#x2019;t tuned in, needs to!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You&#x2019;re a moderator what does that mean to you?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@kubbyelizabeth: Being a moderator means using my skills and talents to enhance the community. My goal is to make someone feel loved, supported, and appreciated. I LOVE marketing and networking. I know no stranger and have yet to run out of questions for any person I have ever met.</p>
<p>I, like many moderators, find people to be interesting and love helping them feel like part of the community. Although I do many similar tasks as the other moderators, my goal is to use my gift to spread joy and awareness of how our members could do the same. Each member that joins is amazing and has something of value to say or do. I make it my mission to find out what he or she are passionate about and help them share it with the group. We are stronger together. The more minnows that join, the more diversified we become, the more we can give back. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What&#x2019;s your service project?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@kubbyelizabeth: My service project is to recruit new members into our community, and recruit current members into other projects. My main focus will be on recruiting new members into various MSP-related projects. I will help fill the needs of other projects within our community. </p>
<p>I will hunt for friends near and far until every single one of them knows about MSP and has joined us. I know no stranger; just friends that I have yet to meet. I will be searching high and low for talented individuals. See, this community is about working together to let us grow faster together. In order to do that, we need Steemit users of all types. Trust me, there is a place for you to add value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How much time do you spend on MSP stuff?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@kubbyelizabeth: When I am off work, over 12 hours, and when I am on my regular schedule, roughly six to eight hours.  Either way, I pick one day a week to completely log off. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why does it matter to you so much?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@kubbyelizabeth: Many on this platform need a friend. We all share a similar core value to give and be generous. I think this is due to the fact that we give to others because we have been given much. I care about people, and any time I find a group of people that believe in uplifting others, then I want in. You can&#x2019;t be everything to everyone, but what you can be will mean everything to someone. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need some channel mods, why should people do it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@kubbyelizabeth: People should become channel mods because even without the title, they are already performing the duties of a channel mod. With the title, they would be empowered to go a step further.  </p>
<p>If people are dedicated to a particular channel already, why wouldn&#x2019;t they want the official role as channel mod? With the title, they will continue to do all the same activities PLUS become empowered to enforce the the integrity of the channel. If you are on Discord, if you love chatting, if you want to help guide and engage with others, then become a channel mod. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What excites you about Steemit?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@kubbyelizabeth: The people excite me. The leadership excites me. The various projects excite me. I am excited! Our friends at MSP/PAL have so much knowledge to share. The fact that each member is unique and participating in various projects only helps me enhance my communication skills, creative talents, and network. One cannot have too many friends. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What&#x2019;s a long term vision for where Steemit is going?and how do you fit into that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@kubbyelizabeth: My long-term vision for Steemit is exactly what we see today. There are many ideas being discussed, many tools being created, and many groups being formed. I see Steemit growing and adapting with the community. As more join, more ideas flow, and more processes will improved. I see myself growing with the community and bringing many with me.<br>Over time as my skills improve, I will be helping to take those ideas and make them into a reality. I see myself helping connect people to people to create a strong community. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What can MSP be doing better?  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>@kubbyelizabeth: To quote @sircork, <em>we have 5000 minnows, and 50 core chat users. Thats a big gap. (also not accurate numbers, more of a generalization for effect) - so somewhere between 500 people who make full use of the community and 4500 who just come for the bots, we have an opportunity to achieve more community and less gathered up individuals. If that makes any sense. When you join a large group, it&#x2019;s a good idea to find a buddy.</em></p>
<p>However, to take it one step further, I think this is not only what MSP could be doing better, but what all members could be doing better. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can minnows contribute to the system and grow their accounts?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@kubbyelizabeth: There is a fun game I play. When I feel that I am not growing, I challenge myself with five challenges. The first challenge is to comment on 20 people&#x2019;s posts: ten from my followers that I have not already interacted with, and ten completely new people. The second challenge is to chat with new people on Discord. Find someone new and befriend them and connect with them. The third challenge is to find 20 more people to comment on their posts. This has to be friends of friends, so I go see who my followers are reading. The fourth challenge is to join a contest. The fifth challenge is to advocate for a Steemit member that I feel could use some extra exposure.  </p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t always go in this order, but these are the five challenges I set for myself to ensure people know that I am here, I am reading, and I am adding value, but also that I want to give to you first. I want you to know that I see value in your content, and that usually triggers people to help me do the same. </p>
<p>If you want to grow and you are already posting regularly with quality content then continue to do that, but add it to. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What else would you want to share here?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@kubbyelizabeth: I love you all so much. I truly spend time in prayer for many on here, and I value your friendship. You also are valuable and mean something to someone. You are worth more than the upvotes you get. You are worth more than the followers that follow you. </p>
<p>What you love, what you are passionate about, what you believe and hold as a core value is what makes you unique. Don&#x2019;t try to be like someone, always be better because no one can do what you do like you do.</p>
<p>Pastor Jeremy from North Point Church in Missouri said it best.<br>&#x201C;The power of community is understanding the healthy relationships and in two words, me too. In community, hang up&#x2019;s become a handle for others to connect. The two most powerful words in community are <em>me too</em>. I have been there; I am there, me too. A stranger becomes a friend when they say, &#x201C;me too.&#x201D; There is power in community. You impress people with your strength, you connect people with weakness. In community, moments become memories. When you intentionally spend time with people, it becomes a memory.&#x201D;   </p>
<p>Spend time here and over time you will stay for the people. </p>
