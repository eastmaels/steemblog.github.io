&#xA0;You&#x2019;re able to use your personal clout in the industry to assure institutional investors that everything is ok when in reality the bank has 5000 people that have been creating accounts.</p><br><p>WB: &#xA0;Who did you say you work with again? &#xA0;</p><br><p>SY: Bloomberg News.</p><br><p>WB: &#xA0;I&#x2019;m going to call Michael about this. &#xA0;Look, 5,000 people in a company that employs 250,000 is a small percentage. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s less than 1%. &#xA0;This isn&#x2019;t across the board corruption. &#xA0;&#xA0;Firing all those people will probably save the company around $5B annually. &#xA0;We took a $185M hit for nearly constant fraud. &#xA0;We&#x2019;re calling this a win.</p><br><p>SY: &#xA0;The actions of those bankers are criminal. &#xA0;Do you think that any prison term will be served?</p><br><p>WB: Ok, this is your last question. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m sure we&#x2019;ll find one or two people worthy of crimes, but I don&#x2019;t suspect many people will be in legal trouble. &#xA0;This is symptoms of an economy in recovery rather than going full speed ahead. &#xA0;As the economy improves these episodes at banks and other institutions will largely subside.</p><br><p>SY: <a href="http://archive.fortune.com/2009/04/19/news/companies/lashinsky_buffett.fortune/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6 years ago when you purchased a large stake in the bank after the financial crisis you said that banks were a good investment as long as they don&#x2019;t do dumb thing</a>s. &#xA0;Is this one of those dumb things?</p><br><p>WB: Sir. &#xA0;We are done.</p><br><p>WB nods at some of his friends.</p><br><p>&#x2014; At this point SY was blocked by a series of rather large and intimidating men as Buffet left the interview. &#xA0;We thank him for his generosity and time.</p><br>

Busy right meow! &#xA0;Like a cat. &#xA0;Cats say meow! &#xA0;This was fun, but I have to get through this cat post before I can get into my next post&#x2026; maybe that will be on endangered turtles.&#xA0; Just make sure you don&#x2019;t mention anything about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe65g0K8ePc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mandela Effect </a>in this post because I don&#x2019;t want it to go all weird like some of your other posts do. &#xA0;We&#x2019;re done now.</p><br><p>SY: Thank you for your time sir.</p><br><p><br></p><br>
