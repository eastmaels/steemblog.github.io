<p>Well, the bear market is in full swing, and everything seems to be going to shit for the moment.  It&#x2019;s probably not even done.  Bitcoin could touch 1k before this is done meaning that the carnage isn&#x2019;t over yet, but that said people are still building here.  In some ways it&#x2019;s a great time to build.  It takes time to get things in place and moving, and hopefully by the time that you&#x2019;re ready to operate we&#x2019;ll be back in bull territory and you should be able to capitalize on that.</p>
<h2 id="Profit-isn&#x2019;t-it&#x2019;s-own-thing"><a href="#Profit-isn&#x2019;t-it&#x2019;s-own-thing" class="headerlink" title="Profit isn&#x2019;t it&#x2019;s own thing"></a>Profit isn&#x2019;t it&#x2019;s own thing</h2><p>Profit is a derivative of two other things: revenue and expenses.  There&#x2019;s nothing you can do to change profit directly.  That&#x2019;s because it&#x2019;s made up of those other two things.  You either have to raise revenue  or lower expenses.</p>
<p>I still have to review buisness plans for competition I put out there.  I got a little behind with the whole baby thing, but I just wanted to put this little reminder out there of what makes a business a good business.  Good businesses are profitable.  How do they get there?  They control their expenses and they collect revenue.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re considering building a business on the Steem blockchain that&#x2019;s great.  We need more of them.  And as ways become available to have tokens on the chain either through side chains or through the blockchain itself there&#x2019;s a better and better chance people here will be able to aggregate funds and build great apps/dapps here.  </p>
<p>My primary word of caution though is you have to figure out how to charge for a service that people want.  I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a real business to have a stake and dole out rewards.  As you can see that isn&#x2019;t a sustainable model especially when the prices go up and down.  You need to have a service or product, collect revenue from that, and make sure you&#x2019;re spending less money than what&#x2019;s coming in.</p>
<h2 id="Charge-fairly"><a href="#Charge-fairly" class="headerlink" title="Charge fairly"></a>Charge fairly</h2><p>You have to do some market research to figure out what people are willing to pay.  Charge too much and you won&#x2019;t get the sales.  Charge too little and you won&#x2019;t have enough money for expansion.  Try a range of prices and see what sticks.  Ask your friends, family, and customers what they would pay or what they think it&#x2019;s worth before committing to a price.</p>
<h2 id="Keep-expenses-down"><a href="#Keep-expenses-down" class="headerlink" title="Keep expenses down"></a>Keep expenses down</h2><p>When you&#x2019;re boot strapping a company it&#x2019;s best to keep costs down.  Yes you could run off that super expensive brand new thing, but ask yourself if you can get something used that does 95% of the job at 30% of the cost if that&#x2019;s good enough.  Try to keep your money burn rate down.</p>
<h2 id="Minimal-Viable-Product"><a href="#Minimal-Viable-Product" class="headerlink" title="Minimal Viable Product"></a>Minimal Viable Product</h2><p>With physical products your goal has to be to ship something that&#x2019;s complete and finished.  No one wants a physical product that barely works.  Software is different.  You need to get the simplest thing out the door that can start generating revenue and then make continuous improvements.</p>
<p>If Steem Monsters had waited until tournaments were done to release we&#x2019;d have had zero revenue and a big burn for 8 months.  That&#x2019;s a rough way to start a company, so you have figure out what is the shortest distance between you and revenue and get there as quickly as you can.</p>
<h2 id="Don&#x2019;t-lose-faith"><a href="#Don&#x2019;t-lose-faith" class="headerlink" title="Don&#x2019;t lose faith"></a>Don&#x2019;t lose faith</h2><p>Crypto is for sure having a rough time, but if you want to catch the next bull market you have to be in a good position with a product to do that.  So, strap in, eat some raman, put down the gold lunchbox, and get lean.  When the bear market is over, your product is ready, and you&#x2019;re able to capture revenue then you&#x2019;ll have a big fat smile on your face.</p>

<p>So, here&#x2019;s my Son!!!  Julius was born at 8:27 am this morning.  He weighed in at a hefty 10 lbs and 9 ounces.  He was 22 inches long.  This little linebacker took hours to bring forth into the world.  Mom is very tired, but resting well.</p>
<h2 id="A-few-things-of-note"><a href="#A-few-things-of-note" class="headerlink" title="A few things of note"></a>A few things of note</h2><p>Because of some poor life choices along the way I didn&#x2019;t make either of the two previous births for my kids very easy on my wife.  It&#x2019;s been a serious regret of how big of a shit I was at various points because I experienced &#x201C;wet brain&#x201D; from long term continuous use of moderate amounts of alcohol every night.  Anyway, it was a major deal to me to try to make this birth the best experience I could for her.</p>
<p>She delivered the first baby with an epidural because that delivery was like a 4 day affair.  The second one was like a 2 hour affair with a hydration IV and stiff upper lip.  This baby was taking forever in part because she effectively delivered what most other people would assume is a 3 month old.  As part of this labor she mediated the pain with nitrous.  It&#x2019;s growing in popularity and I can see why.  It didn&#x2019;t take away the pain, but made it bearable.  This thing was going forever, but she didn&#x2019;t get mentally fatigued from it because of this choice.  The nitrous doesn&#x2019;t pass the placenta so baby doesn&#x2019;t feel it.  It may have prolonged some of this labor because she may have been breathing through some contractions rather than pushing, but it was so freaking long that it seems to have been a good call.</p>
<p>What it did do was take her into outerspace a little bit, which to her was frankly a blessing for this ordeal.  It gave me an opportunity to redeem myself a little by being able to stand by her in a steadfast manner and provide a deep voice to cut through the haze and coach her through a few hours of contractions.</p>
<p>At the height of the labor she put the nitrous down and regained total control about 15 min later and had a lot of hormones to help her through it.  That&#x2019;s another reason that it was awesome because she was effectively 15 min at any time from being able to snap back into it, which isn&#x2019;t the case with powerful narcotics.  She can remember nearly all of it, but there was a short span where she could feel she was in outer space, but knew it was cool cause I was there to help and guide her through this.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s a major debt I&#x2019;ve owed to my wife to provide one non-fucked up personal experience of a delivery.  I think I did better than that and really was able to help and support her through a pretty challenging ordeal.  I feel a little lighter today than I have with her in the 3 years I&#x2019;ve been back from we brain version of me.</p>
<h2 id="Older-sisters"><a href="#Older-sisters" class="headerlink" title="Older sisters"></a>Older sisters</h2><p>Julius has two older sisters.  I have sang for them for years to help put them to sleep.  A few hours after Julius was born they came by to visit.  Every time that he started to cry they started to sing songs that I&#x2019;ve sang to them for years, and every time that happened he stopped crying and just looked towards the singing voices with a loving grin and wonderment.  This is a pattern that started because my mom used to sing to me, and I&#x2019;m heartbroken because she passed when I was ill.  That said, my second baby is the spitting image of my mother, so to hear her singing for Julius feels like knowing a little karmic cycle inspired by my mom keeps going on.</p>
<h2 id="Recovering"><a href="#Recovering" class="headerlink" title="Recovering"></a>Recovering</h2><p>Mom is tired, but she&#x2019;s in great spirits and recovering well.  Hopefully we&#x2019;re reunited back at the house in two days time.  We&#x2019;ll see what the universe actually provides here.</p>
<h2 id="Best-day-ever"><a href="#Best-day-ever" class="headerlink" title="Best day ever!"></a>Best day ever!</h2><p>Anyway, I&#x2019;ve been reflecting on today.  I&#x2019;ve been healthy in this world since October 19th 2015.  This is the best day I&#x2019;ve had in 3 years of being healthy.  Just want to share a piece of that joy and pride.  Thanks for your many prayers, sent love, and positive vibes sent our way.  Namaste.</p>
<h2 id="Birthday-gifts"><a href="#Birthday-gifts" class="headerlink" title="Birthday gifts"></a>Birthday gifts</h2><p>For folks that want to send him a little something it&#x2019;s probably best to just kickstart his Steem Monsters deck.  I created the account @trollbaby.  Feel free to send a pack in his honor there!  FYI baby 3 trolled us 3 times before actually starting labor (babies are the ones that actually signal for labor to start).  So, yeah that was three trips to hospital with early labor that didn&#x2019;t accelerate into active labor so the very least I can do is start his steem life with @trollbaby!</p>

            <p>Ok, there&#x2019;s so much blood in the streets it&#x2019;s amazing.  BTC took a nose dive.  Fundamentals didn&#x2019;t change in the last 2 weeks.  Sentiment did, but btc is getting a ton of new users from this.  People that wished they had invested at the lows are coming in.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-you-supposed-to-do-when-price-is-low"><a href="#What-are-you-supposed-to-do-when-price-is-low" class="headerlink" title="What are you supposed to do when price is low?"></a>What are you supposed to do when price is low?</h1><p>I wrote two posts already about what I think you should do.  This time I&#x2019;ll just ask some questions.  Fill in the blank &#x201C;<strong>_ low __</strong> high&#x201D;</p>
<p>These prices are fantastic!  Can they go down?  Yes!  But each time they go down what do you think happens to the probability that we&#x2019;ve hit bottom?</p>
<p>When this market bottoms out then what will happen?  When the fear turns to greed.  When the big boys see epic lows.  What do you think they will do?</p>
<h2 id="Is-crypto-dead"><a href="#Is-crypto-dead" class="headerlink" title="Is crypto dead?"></a>Is crypto dead?</h2><p>Did everyone stop posting on Steem?  Did people stop playing the games?  Did all the projects suddenly halt?  No?  Well why not?</p>
<p>Crypto is the future of practically all data.  Public, verified, trustless, transparent.  This is the future.  The last 50 years has been all about the transfer of data on the large economic scale.  We&#x2019;re gonna blast that open.</p>
<h2 id="So-bring-on-the-lows"><a href="#So-bring-on-the-lows" class="headerlink" title="So, bring on the lows"></a>So, bring on the lows</h2><p>The sooner we bottom the sooner this biatch starts climbing again.  Be thrilled.  Think about whether this is the right time to be buying or selling.  To be divesting or accumulating.  Make up your mind on that, and then act accordingly.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#x2019;ve loaded up on some Steem.  More is coming.  I&#x2019;ll tell ya.  It&#x2019;s fun, and I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s going to be a better opportunity than this chunk of time right now for another year or more.</p>
<p>Stay frosty.  Have fun!</p>
<p>due your own due diligence bitches</p>

<p>The biggest political scandal is ongoing right now.  This makes Watergate look like Potterygate.  This video is the single greatest explanation for what&#x2019;s happening politically in the mainstream media and major players right now.  Take the 30 minutes to figure out how all these bastards are colluding as far back to Enron.</p>

<p>Hey folks,  well, shane dun got his car broked.  So, isaria has gun on to rescue my fair, tall, and galant cohost leaving me all alone for 2 hours of radio.  Very scary.  So, I&#x2019;ve gone ahead and enlisted the queen of curation herself to come join us on air.  @llfarms is gonna hop on and I suppose we&#x2019;ll talk homesteading, curation, and who knows what else.</p>
<p>The first half of the show is usually pretty meandering.  We&#x2019;ll still look out for some posts to curate from the audience.  I&#x2019;m open to on air readings.  We&#x2019;ll see what you guys come up with.</p>
<p>We may talk about some Steem Monsters stuff.  We got some changes coming early next week and here&#x2019;s a good opportunity to share some news.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Peace Academy can be many things.  Sometimes conspiracy, sometimes woo-woo, sometimes deeply personal.  Let thy heart be thy compass and let&#x2019;s see where she goes.</p>
<p>Show starts in 15 min on mspwaves.com/listen and in <a href="minnowpond.org">PALnet</a>.  See you there.</p>

        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Last year at the high inertia said  to me&#x201D;we are in a bubble.&#x201D;  I thought &#x201C;no, this is the new way!&#x201D; One of us was right and my net worth dropped.  I&#x2019;ve been kicking myself for a year.  So, I don&#x2019;t want that to happen to me again, and I want to be a guy that says &#x201C;hey don&#x2019;t miss out on this.&#x201D;</p>
<h1 id="don&#x2019;t-miss-out-on-this"><a href="#don&#x2019;t-miss-out-on-this" class="headerlink" title="don&#x2019;t miss out on this"></a>don&#x2019;t miss out on this</h1><p>There is blood in the streets.  Crypto is going through stages of capitulation.  It is possible we will see lower prices over the next few weeks and months, but the recovery can also take place soon.  It&#x2019;s impossible to tell.</p>
<p>What&#x2019;s not impossible to tell is that crypto is going to have another all time high.  We aren&#x2019;t dead.  We are reloading.  This is roughly the eighth cycle of this.</p>
<p>On that front SteemFest was filled with multiple days of developers talking about what they are building here.  Smts are coming.  People will launch thousands of them.  Few will make it to anything but those that do will horde some Steem and drive prices up.  Instutional money has been setting up for this moment, and when we go back up it&#x2019;s gonna be with Goldman Sachs money in there.  The future of crypto and the future of Steem are healthy.</p>
<h1 id="what-to-do"><a href="#what-to-do" class="headerlink" title="what to do?"></a>what to do?</h1><p>Stop spending money on useless shit.  Invest in crypto.  Buy Steem.</p>
<p>You can earn here through the distribution tools, and while it&#x2019;s not always a ton, it&#x2019;s easier when you have some steem and stake if your own.  You can build here and work with others to program, market, sell, or creatively inspire projects.  </p>
<p>Take money you&#x2019;re going to otherwise waste on some useless holiday shit you won&#x2019;t care abou a month from now and start putting some money into Steem every day or every week.</p>
<h1 id="what-not-to-do"><a href="#what-not-to-do" class="headerlink" title="what not to do"></a>what not to do</h1><p>Don&#x2019;t take everything you have and dump it all in at once.  There is a chance we are at bottom.  There is a chance we are not.  Try to make a few extra bucks or save them and put that into Steem OVER TIME.</p>
<h1 id="a-year-from-now"><a href="#a-year-from-now" class="headerlink" title="a year from now"></a>a year from now</h1><p>I think crypto will be up and Steem will be doing great.  Maybe it&#x2019;s two years, but I don&#x2019;t think it will take that long.  There&#x2019;s another all time high coming, and in order to make a shit ton of money on it we have to invest now and be patient.  </p>
<p>So, I&#x2019;ve said it.  I will keep saying it.  Steem under a dollar is fucking steal.  Steem under 50 cents is insane.  We are in the zone where you are likely going to find the single best entry point for the next year.  Don&#x2019;t miss it.</p>
<h1 id="is-this-financial-advice"><a href="#is-this-financial-advice" class="headerlink" title="is this financial advice"></a>is this financial advice</h1><p>I don&#x2019;t know you, and I don&#x2019;t know what you can afford to spend.  This is general investing advice, but I can&#x2019;t know the specifics of what is right for you and your family.  Don&#x2019;t put money in you will need out in the short term.  Do your own due diligence and make smart choices using this as just part of it.</p>
<p>Lastly, Steem monsters have held up exceptionally well.  Consider them as they have slightly less risk but I also don&#x2019;t know if they have the same upside yet.</p>
