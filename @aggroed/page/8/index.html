            <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TYwexsi.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Good news Steemians!  You can now start your own community powered by Proof of Brain distribution!  It took us a few months, but we&#x2019;ve been able to build a smart contract platform, allow for token creation and trading, stake (power up) the tokens, distribute them using a customizable python voting bot modeled after the SMT white paper, and more is coming.  </p>
<p>Both @yabapmatt and I have put up our own money to get Steem Engine and the distribution system created, and there will be ongoing infrastructure and personnel costs to run the system, so we are offering it as a paid service, but we want to work with active and serious communities to make sure it is affordable and even profitable to run your own proof of brain token.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;re currently prototyping an integration of advertising into a custom website (we&#x2019;ll use condenser, the code behind steemit.com), which we can run on your behalf for your token. </p>
<p>One thing the new communities running off of the website will like is that we&#x2019;ll display post rewards in your token!  So, it won&#x2019;t show how much steem you&#x2019;re earning.  Instead it&#x2019;ll show how much of your community&#x2019;s token the post is earning.</p>
<p>The next major step after getting the prototype launched is incorporating advertising into the custom websites.  If this all works your investment in a Scotbot community will generate more revenue in ads than is spent on running the community!  What you do with that revenue is up to you!  </p>
<p>Will you collect it and lambo-up?  Or will you buy tokens with it to burn to inflate the price?  How will you manage the project?</p>
<h2 id="So-many-thanks"><a href="#So-many-thanks" class="headerlink" title="So many thanks!"></a>So many thanks!</h2><p>This project couldn&#x2019;t launch without @harpagon or @yabamatt who created the smart contract platform and built a front end for it.  </p>
<p>We were lucky to borrow @asgarth (thanks @jarvie and @steempeak), and he built the exchange that&#x2019;s on the platform modeled after the steem/sbd market.  </p>
<p>@wehmoen built a block explorer and we link out to it on the site.  </p>
<p>@beggars took over site creation  and has taken on lead developer role for the steem-engine front end.  </p>
<p>@someguy123 created and now manages the crypto converter that&#x2019;s powering how we can deposit and trade other cryptos onto the exchange.</p>
<p>@holger80, master of python and beem, took on constructing Scotbot and allowing for many customizations.<br>@inertia built a second block explorer and has been helping us track down bizarre transactions and coordinate dev ops.  </p>
<p>@crystalhuman and @clayboyn have been helping us with some user concerns along the way.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;re of course standing on the shoulders of the Steem platform so thank you to the Steemit team.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s been a great team and we&#x2019;re super productive!  I&#x2019;m looking forward to more!</p>
<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-next"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-next" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s next?"></a>What&#x2019;s next?</h2><p>Beyond the custom websites that generate you revenue for your community we have a few things planned.  Next up on the crypto converter side is the integration of EOS and EOS tokens.  So, not just trading EOS, but we&#x2019;ll trade the 100+ tokens that live on EOS.  </p>
<p>This is another step in turning steem-engine into a one stop trading shop to turn any asset class into a different asset class.  Take crypto, tokens, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, commodities, futures, or government fiat and turn it into any of other assets and have it happen transparently on the Steem blockchain!</p>
<p>So, we got custom sites with ads in the works, a crypto converter that&#x2019;s gonna keep expanding, and we&#x2019;ve started on a STO/ICO/IEO launcher!  Once we&#x2019;ve made it easy to gather money here then it makes more sense to launch tokens here.  Build a business, register the token, and launch a security.  Or go the ICO route where you have a product functioning and it&#x2019;s powered by the token you sell via an ICO.  We&#x2019;ll help with both.  You&#x2019;ll setup a crowdfund like kickstarter where you can set the goal, send the money back if it doesn&#x2019;t reach goal, and we&#x2019;ll get multiple currencies accepted there!</p>
<p>These are exciting times!</p>
<h2 id="Greasing-the-wheels"><a href="#Greasing-the-wheels" class="headerlink" title="Greasing the wheels"></a>Greasing the wheels</h2><p>I&#x2019;ve placed a 10,000 ENG sell wall at 0.8 ENG/Steem.  This is a 20% discount for the first 10 communities that would like to distribute their tokens with scotbot.  With Steem prices low and this discount it&#x2019;s a really inexpensive time to launch the first independent token communities built on top of Steem!</p>

            <p>This is going back to the vision of Steem-Engine for a sec.  The vision is to create a vibrant trading platform that empowers token creation and launch on top of the Steem blockchain.</p>
<p>Business owners and community leaders need a way to pool money so they can launch awesome buinesses and communities.  To do that they need tokens, a trading platform, and a way to launch this stuff successfully.</p>
<h2 id="Let&#x2019;s-Pretend-that-Steem-Engine-com-is-the-Angel-of-Light-for-a-second&#x2026;"><a href="#Let&#x2019;s-Pretend-that-Steem-Engine-com-is-the-Angel-of-Light-for-a-second&#x2026;" class="headerlink" title="Let&#x2019;s Pretend that Steem-Engine.com is the Angel of Light for a second&#x2026;"></a>Let&#x2019;s Pretend that Steem-Engine.com is the Angel of Light for a second&#x2026;</h2><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SpGblah.jpg" alt=""><br>At level 1 Steem-Engine springs to life.  She&#x2019;s barely capable of much.  She has so much promise and life, but her spells are weak, they are cast on weak monsters, and she doens&#x2019;t seem to offer all that much.  She can create tokens, and you can sell them on the exchange with a very basic UI.  </p>
<p>She&#x2019;s got a gnarly tendency to change block zero when updating versions, so it&#x2019;s almost like she&#x2019;s got some weird hump on her back too.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5ze55sR.jpg" alt=""><br>At level 2 she&#x2019;s now getting a little armor and looking a bit more pimp and sure of herself.  She&#x2019;s releasing a new contract that allows tokens to be staked and this enables a whole new era of how businesses and communities can interact with the tokens.  You can issue them, trade them, power them up, and (starting very soon) you can use proof of brain to distribute them.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CV3svs0.jpg" alt=""><br>By level 3 she&#x2019;s kind of a beast.  Don&#x2019;t mess with this lady.  She&#x2019;ll kick your ass and laugh at you.  She&#x2019;s now trading not only Steem and Steem-Engine tokens, but she&#x2019;s got EOS/Tron/Eth/Bts and other systems all trading on top of the platform.  She&#x2019;s also now setup to launch ICOs/STOs with a platform like startengine.com or kickstarter.com.  Because of all the various tokens and some of the tools to attract liquidity the website turns out to be a great place to trade.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UHtSiGT.jpg" alt=""><br>Holy shit this woman&#x2019;s a untouchable goddess.  It turns out that trading fiat for tokens is hard, but it&#x2019;s not that bad to get a broker dealer lisence and be able to trade securities.  The site is now trading steem, steem-engine tokens, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Doge, BCH.  It&#x2019;s also trading other cryptos and their token ecosystems like EOS, Tron, Eth, BTS (Yes, all the tokens that live on them too).  She&#x2019;s also trading stocks, bonds, mutual funds, futures, and commodities.  It&#x2019;s a giant exchange to turn one thing of value into just about any other thing of value.</p>
<p>She sets her eyes on incorporating fiat too&#x2026;</p>
<h2 id="Scot-progression"><a href="#Scot-progression" class="headerlink" title="Scot progression"></a>Scot progression</h2><p>So, that&#x2019;s the progress of Steem-Engine.com.  Let&#x2019;s do the same thing for Scot, but this time scot is the chromatic dragon.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XtlWbAD.jpg" alt=""><br>At level 1 Scot isn&#x2019;t the most impressive dude out there.  There&#x2019;s likely other monsters with nicer hair that you&#x2019;d like to use in a fight.  Scot&#x2019;s just getting started.  Token staking just began, and it&#x2019;s day one.  To get Scot rolling a community decides to prototype with Scotbot.  </p>
<p>Scotbot has some issues because it&#x2019;s a python voting bot.  The rules can change and it&#x2019;s  centralized.  It makes some people nervous to really invest heavily because theft is prevalent in crypto.  But it&#x2019;s a great prototyping tool, and it helps communities understand complicated formulas for how proof-of-brain works in reality.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/urgO1oJ.jpg" alt=""><br>SCOT has stood for Smart Contract Organizational Token.  Scotbot is the python version, but many people in crypto trust smart contracts controlled by autonomous platforms over python voting bots controlled by individuals.  Scot is coded as a smart contract. It&#x2019;s actually built into a Steem post and read by the Steem-Engine node.  It&#x2019;s now a contract that a community leader funds with their tokens and the distribution happens exactly as the code reads without alteration that isn&#x2019;t included in the contract.</p>
<p>Users can trust this 100% to do what it says it&#x2019;s going to do and they can invest more heavily knowing that the Smart Contract is functioning.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vpi3kMv.jpg" alt=""><br>Scot&#x2019;s looking pretty effing beefy.  That&#x2019;s because now that many of the base level smart contracts have been written it&#x2019;s now possible to write custom smart contracts on the platform (it was already able, but there wasn&#x2019;t time to get them coded).  Any if/then statement you can think of can be turned into a smart contract and that contract can be used to facilitate business and making money.  Not only are communities and businesses using proof of brain distribution, but they&#x2019;re tying into all these different smart contracts that really let them customize how their community operates.</p>
<p>With large communities adopting, a larger pool of devs to pool from, tons of talent from the crypto ecosystem, and strong leadership Scot is a force to reckoned with.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZMuWADV.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>My god this scary looking thing is about to destroy all of Japan with nuclear laser beam eyes and dragon esque flames.  He&#x2019;s like godzilla but on steroids.  When the chest beam goes off a destructive force never seen before is unleashed on the world of fiat and his final form is released.</p>
<h2 id="You-get-the-idea"><a href="#You-get-the-idea" class="headerlink" title="You get the idea!"></a>You get the idea!</h2><p>These things happen in levels and stages. We&#x2019;re still at the early stage, but I think we have a vision, team, direction, and community that can pull this off.</p>
<p>I hope you join us for the ride (ie buy eng, start a token, launch scotbot).  Look out in the next day or two, because Scotbot is starting in earnest very soon.</p>

<p>More good news.  We (@yabapmatt) merged in the <a href="https://github.com/MattyIce/steem-engine/pull/54" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pull request</a> that @beggars authored to enable staking on Steem-Engine.com.</p>
<p>If you own a token you now have the ability to enable staking.  For a normal user staking works like turning Steem into Steem Power.  You go in the wallet and can click the button that looks like a lock or unlock and that allows you to stake and unstake tokens.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQTGWE4gAVrj5UdvWcT4PYmowis2CPq7zppFHzLHEose3/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For the token creator staking has 2 more steps.</p>
<p>Step 1.  Click the &#x201C;enable staking&#x201D; option.  Only the account that created it will see this option.<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmR5nSvjBTtxq51cERrPNkZFPSTVagPDdcE2jtvS9ympoC/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Step 2.  Give staking some rules<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmRnucfvAQBLNZu9XJo8zryzFMwC1vcLiykF7WRkkkUh5H/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Powering Up works like Steem where it&#x2019;s instant.  Powering Down has 2 variables.</p>
<p>The first variable is how many days it takes to unstake a coin and the second variable is how many times that&#x2019;s broken down into smaller steps.</p>
<p>Steem is set to 91 days to unstake broken into 13 transactions.</p>
<p>You can set a variety of options here.  If you wanted staking to happen rapidly then click 1 day and 1 transaction and 24hrs after your unstake you&#x2019;ll get the full amount.  If you wanted to go slow you could choose 365 and 365 and every day it would release a sliver of your staked coins.</p>
<p>These values aren&#x2019;t changable for the tokens.  They are set for all eternity once you choose them.  So, be careful when you&#x2019;re setting this up!</p>
<h2 id="Almost-there"><a href="#Almost-there" class="headerlink" title="Almost there!"></a>Almost there!</h2><p>We&#x2019;re nearly at the the finish line for V1 of Scotbot rolling out publicly.  We&#x2019;re hoping in the next 24-48hrs we&#x2019;re there.  Last step is figuring out some UI on the site for the automated sign up process for Scotbot.  A lot of it is done.  We&#x2019;re testing and should launch soon.</p>

<p>Hey Steemians.  I&#x2019;m happy to announce two key updates.  </p>
<h1 id="Hardfork-SUCCESS"><a href="#Hardfork-SUCCESS" class="headerlink" title="Hardfork SUCCESS!!"></a>Hardfork SUCCESS!!</h1><p>The hardfork was successful!  Earlier today @harpagon got a second node up and running that&#x2019;s on the most recent hardfork.  He switched over from the previous to the new node at 8pm after observing it working properly for several hours.</p>
<p>One of the new parts of this is that contract changes can now be made without altering the hashes of all of the previous blocks.  This was a necessary step at the beginning to get us going, but now it&#x2019;s unnecessary and has been updated.</p>
<h1 id="Staking"><a href="#Staking" class="headerlink" title="Staking!"></a>Staking!</h1><p>The staking mechanism has been added through a contract update that was published to the Steem blockchain.  Yes, the smart  contracts - the actual code - are published via posts on the Steem blockchain!</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s the updated tokens contract code that includes staking:  <a href="https://steemd.com/tx/19b1ebfb7502847fb1e582852d546e6ce363207c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemd.com/tx/19b1ebfb7502847fb1e582852d546e6ce363207c</a></p>
<p>It&#x2019;s live as of right now!</p>
<h2 id="Where&#x2019;s-that-leave-Scotbot"><a href="#Where&#x2019;s-that-leave-Scotbot" class="headerlink" title="Where&#x2019;s that leave Scotbot?"></a>Where&#x2019;s that leave Scotbot?</h2><p>We&#x2019;re not quite done with the front end side of things.  As of tonight all of the backed is functional for the node, and all of our first run through of Scotbot looks complete and good to go!</p>
<p>So, at this point we are waiting on just a little more back and forth and another couple of tests between holger80 with scotbot and beggars with site automation.</p>
<p>We need another little bit, but I expect that we&#x2019;ll be up and running with scotbot sometime this week.</p>
<p>Steem on!</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve been thinking that one of the things that is missing from Steem-Engine is liquidity for the market.  Maybe not all tokens should be traded a lot, but we should be able to get some good volume against bitcoin, litecoin, doge, BCH, and other majors that are being added to the exchange soon.</p>
<p>I could run around begging people to put money on the exchange and that might work, but I like to think of ways that abundance can be achieved.  I&#x2019;ve been thinking about the need of a market making bot and how we can make one that anyone who puts money into it can benefit from it.</p>
<h2 id="Proof-of-Trade-Digital-Mining-Bot"><a href="#Proof-of-Trade-Digital-Mining-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Proof of Trade Digital Mining Bot"></a>Proof of Trade Digital Mining Bot</h2><p>So, I want it so that you buy a token, the token funds are used to fund a market making bot, and the token ownership determines your percent chance of getting daily rewards from trading.  It&#x2019;s a combination of the mining concept and market making trading concept.</p>
<p>So, a market making bot will buy and sell tokens.  When it sells them it buys some back at a cheaper price.  When it buys them it also sells some at a higher price.  The bot doesn&#x2019;t really care about the current prices.  It&#x2019;s just trading back and forth all day and trying to skim off of every trade.  </p>
<p>Often this function is performed by 1 person with a lot of money, but I&#x2019;d rather open source it and allow many people with smaller amounts of money to profit from this thing.  It&#x2019;s important to me that everyone on the exchange has a chance to make money because of their involvement on the exchange!</p>
<h2 id="So-how-does-it-work-again"><a href="#So-how-does-it-work-again" class="headerlink" title="So, how does it work again?"></a>So, how does it work again?</h2><p>Step 1.  Money is raised and all of it goes into purchasing steemp/and a pegged crypto.<br>Step 2.  For every dollar raised you get 1 Proof-of-Trading token.<br>Step 3.  Steem and Crypto bids are placed in a spread on both sides of the trade in a range.<br>Step 4.  Trading happens and every trade generates money.<br>Step 5.  100% Proceeds of the bot are randomly given out each day according to how many tokens the owners hold.</p>

<p>Ok, a few people have been mentioning Steem is dead to me recently.  So, I want to clarify a little FUD that&#x2019;s out there and try to bring my perspective to the FUD.</p>
<p>First off, Steem is really hard to kill.  The only way I see it dying is if the price of running a node exceeds the proceeds of running that node either for a long time or drastically for short times.</p>
<h2 id="Boring-witness-math"><a href="#Boring-witness-math" class="headerlink" title="Boring witness math"></a>Boring witness math</h2><p>Right now a top 20 witness makes 110,000 steem per year or something in that vicinity.  Each Steem is worth 33 cents right now.  So, witnesses are earning $36,000 per year.  I run two witness nodes (and pay for half of the minnowsupport rpc, but that&#x2019;s separate from this).  My nodes cost $120/month each.  So, that&#x2019;s $240/month.  So, that&#x2019;s about 3k per year.  The price of steem has to get down to 3 cents before I start asking myself &#x201C;do I even want to run a node here?&#x201D;  Maybe some of the backup witnesses would stop hosting Steemd by 3 cents, but I don&#x2019;t see enough leaving to stop the chain until Steem hits 3 cents.  At that point it&#x2019;s not immediate either.  I have liquid steem I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d kill my witness just cause it isn&#x2019;t profitable for a while.  I was losing money when it first started.  It can lose money again.  Witnesses could also change the reward pool to ensure that there&#x2019;s enough money for the basic infrastructure.</p>
<p>RPCs cost more and maybe we could see the number of full RPCs drop or maybe even many of them stop, but in that case i think more people will band together to cover partial costs and Steemit has some cash.  They may make decisions I don&#x2019;t always agree with, but I don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;d let the project die over RPCs as long as they could afford to, and they have some runway.</p>
<h2 id="MIRA"><a href="#MIRA" class="headerlink" title="MIRA"></a>MIRA</h2><p>More importantly than the right this second discussion is that MIRA seems pretty close.  MIRA allows nodes to run with data that&#x2019;s currently stored in ram to be stored on hard drives.  The difference in cost for that is staggering.  A full node would drop from 512Gb of Ram to closer to 8 or 16 Gb.  The server would go from something like $650/month to something closer to $20/month.  Witness nodes are gonna be less.  So, now run the math again.  If it only costs $20 a month and yeah you probably run 2 for $40/month as long as you can make more than $480/yr there will be people willing to donate time to run them.  Post MIRA the discussion of closing my witness starts if steem hits 0.004 cents per steem.  </p>
<p>Steem from that end is pretty unkillable.  It takes a calamity to kill steem and make the chain stop and this project completely die.</p>
<h2 id="Loss-of-people"><a href="#Loss-of-people" class="headerlink" title="Loss of people"></a>Loss of people</h2><p>So, the next Fear is that Steem is running out of people that will stick around and this whole enterprise is doomed.  Whales are selling, price will go down, no one will post, and even if the chain is still going the whole ecosystem is basically dead.</p>
<p>Some aspects of that are happening, and the price of steem vs BTC has never been worse.  So, I can&#x2019;t outright dismiss it, but</p>
<p>there were 400k posts last week<br>4M votes<br>49k accounts transacting<br>4k new accounts created<br>the least net amount of steem powered down in 2 months (260k powered down below what was powered up)</p>
<h2 id="Side-lined"><a href="#Side-lined" class="headerlink" title="Side lined"></a>Side lined</h2><p>Eve online has a pretty funny idea.  They think they never lose players unless they die.  They just go on break.  Same is true here.  Human behavior is pretty predictable.</p>
<p><strong>Price is high Madlib:</strong> Hi (synonym for friends), it&#x2019;s great to see everyone one.  For the past while I&#x2019;ve been experiencing (random excuse for leaving).  It&#x2019;s kept me gone, but now I&#x2019;m back to keep my discussion of (random blogging topic) alive and well.  Great to be here, and don&#x2019;t forget to follow me!</p>
<p><strong>Price is low Madlib:</strong> Hi (synonym for fuckfaces), you guys can eat my (sexual body part).  This platform doesn&#x2019;t even comprehend my (self aggrandinzing adjective) ability at (random skill).  You don&#x2019;t appreciate me and now I&#x2019;m the fuck out.  (entitled sign off)</p>
<p>My point is that people don&#x2019;t actually leave.  They just stop posting when they don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s financially worth it.  When it is worth it they&#x2019;ll all come back.</p>
<h2 id="Tree-Rings"><a href="#Tree-Rings" class="headerlink" title="Tree Rings"></a>Tree Rings</h2><p>I think it was @demotruk that spoke about this as rings on a tree.  Every season as the tree grows it gets rings to mark the growth of the inhale and exhale of life.  Steem has really thick rings.  It&#x2019;s thick because:</p>
<p>Distribution makes for high amounts of sell pressure<br>people come to earn, when earning potential is high they flock, when it&#x2019;s low they leave in droves<br>SBD makes steem more volatile than any other crypto.  At the lows we&#x2019;re adding 5% inflation in a year due to conversions at the high we&#x2019;re paying out premium SBD.</p>
<h2 id="In-order-to-improve-the-cycle"><a href="#In-order-to-improve-the-cycle" class="headerlink" title="In order to improve the cycle"></a>In order to improve the cycle</h2><p>We need a better distribution which is already happening to some extent.<br>We need people who buy steem to invest rather than just earn it to cash out, so we need businesses they can park steem into<br>We need the crypto market cap to rise and Steem will float with it<br>We need the Steem Alliance functioning with coordinated efforts across the ecosystem.<br>We need less reliance on Steemit to do stuff and more community driven work and hype</p>
<h2 id="My-actual-prediction"><a href="#My-actual-prediction" class="headerlink" title="My actual prediction"></a>My actual prediction</h2><p>Bitcoin has already bottomed.  A bear trap is forming.  It&#x2019;s going to knock the price down again and shake out the last of the weak hands before rebounding in the face of the impending halvening.  When it rebounds it&#x2019;s going to 100k in the next 2 years.  </p>
<p>Steem is going to lag behind bitcoin and the rise of other altcoins.  Eventually the other sexier and better hyped projects will get saturated and investors will go looking for bargain alt coins.  Steem will be sitting there with big doe eyes.  The price will start rising, and the rising price will attract bloggers and investors and the pendulum will swing the other way hard are fast.  By the time BTC hits $100k steem will be $100/steem or more (before 2022) and the people that hodled through this or buy some at 33 cents will see something like 30,000% gains on their investment if they have the balls to hang with it to the next ATH of btc.</p>
<p>If you agree with that assessment then you should be dollar cost average buying in right now with what you can afford in case this analysis is wrong and the biblical flood is actually approaching (ie buy a little at a time rather than blow your wad all at once).</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#x2019;s not financial advice and all that other disclaimer shit.  It&#x2019;s just how I see it and I hope it helps provide a non-fear based perspective from a optimist.</p>
