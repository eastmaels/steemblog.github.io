<p>I have a business colleague who uses this line all the time.  He&#x2019;s trying to figure out how to grow companies, change products, and work with customers.  Seems like every time he comes back to &#x201C;leadership and incentive.&#x201D;  After being his friend for about 5 years and watching the truth in those words I&#x2019;ve come to believe him.  That&#x2019;s why a lot of what I write and do is focused around those two aspects.  It&#x2019;s not always transparent, but they are always there.</p>
<h2 id="Delegation-is-the-key-to-authority"><a href="#Delegation-is-the-key-to-authority" class="headerlink" title="Delegation is the key to authority "></a>Delegation is the key to authority </h2><h2></h2><p>There are lots of ways to be a leader.  You can be a boss whipping people in to shape.  I kinda hate that approach.  I prefer the idea of a leader.  Taking a stand and rolling with the punches that come with it.  I have a few simple guidelines I follow for how to be a good leader.  It came from working on sustainability for one of the world&#x2019;s largest companies.</p>
<p>This is generally how I make decisions.</p>
<p>Problem Statement<br>Vision Statement<br>Mission Statement<br>Stakeholder analysis and involvement<br>Actionplan<br>Communication (outward)<br>Feedback (inward)</p>
<p>Every time I hit a challenge I start trying to figure out what&#x2019;s the problem, what&#x2019;s a vision that works, what&#x2019;s the mission/objectives, involve the community (which usually refines everything), and then step into the action plan.  Whenever there is success it&#x2019;s time to communicate it.  Lots of opportunities for that when you&#x2019;ve planned well.  Then work in some feedback so that you can tweak things for your audience, peers, team, bosses, etc.</p>
<h2 id="Leaderfull"><a href="#Leaderfull" class="headerlink" title="Leaderfull "></a>Leaderfull </h2><h2></h2><p>One of the things that I also believe in for leadership is giving passionate people authority to do shit.  You can&#x2019;t do this with wimpy dweebs that don&#x2019;t care, but for the truly passionate I think &#x201C;Give them authority and get out of their way.&#x201D;  I do my best to turn Minnow Support Project into a place where people with ideas and passion can get them to work.  Don&#x2019;t come to me and say what should I do!!!!  I don&#x2019;t know.  I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re passionate about.  Come to me with your passion and tell me how you think you can change the world.  I&#x2019;ll see what I can do to help fit it into the plans.  I&#x2019;ll give you room to operate and just try to support your dreams.</p>
<p>I can&#x2019;t micromanage a fiction publishing house, a website launch, a new bot creation, a radio station, a few country channels, a shit ton of bots, 3500 people, abuse and everything that comes with MSP.  I just try to give people that are passionate about one of those aspects some guidelines and then free rein.  So, far it&#x2019;s basically been amazing!</p>
<h2 id="Incentive"><a href="#Incentive" class="headerlink" title="Incentive "></a>Incentive </h2><h2></h2><p>The other aspect of this is incentive.  In lots of video games you have to grind stuff out.  What can you grind out in Steemit?</p>
<p>SP, SBD, and Steem are the easiest to think of, but in some ways aren&#x2019;t the most valuable.<br>Followers, friends, resteems, and connections I think are a much bigger deal.  Status is a huge one.  Perception of you.  These trend towards long term success as opposed to short term metrics.</p>
<p>So, if you&#x2019;re a redfish or minnow or even plankton dont&#x2019; ask how much did I earn today.  Think about how many friends and followers you&#x2019;ve put together.  That will have a much longer impact on your success.</p>
<p>As for status I think that&#x2019;s a big one too.  You&#x2019;ll notice there are a shit ton of ranks in the Minnow Support Project.  Lots of steps.  Lots of ways to get higher up on the totem pole in there.  It might look complicated, but it&#x2019;s not that hard.  I try to think of ways that people can add value and then make ranks to show the value they contribute.  I think people want to be recognized for what they do.  It&#x2019;s free for me to give recognition for the hours people put in.</p>
<p>I try to say please and thank you.  I try to tell people I&#x2019;m grateful for their friendship and support.  I drop little  pictures of cakes and tea into comments I write back.  it&#x2019;s an effort to be thoughtful for the kindness and effort people show.  And the amazing thing is that on this platform more than anywhere else I&#x2019;ve seen in life what you give is given back a thousand fold.</p>
<h2 id="Call-to-Action"><a href="#Call-to-Action" class="headerlink" title="Call to Action "></a>Call to Action </h2><h2></h2><p>Ask yourself how can you make this place better.  If you come up with some cool shit I&#x2019;ll be the first to support you.<br>Ask yourself how you can take action so that you&#x2019;re not looking for a central authority to make some change, but you&#x2019;re actively being the change while gathering support.<br>Finally, to be a good leader try to reward the people around you with as many of the different things you can give.  Many are on chain.  Others are off chain.  Show gratitude and lead the way.</p>
<h2 id="PS-Don&#x2019;t-be-afraid-to-call-out-some-exceptional-folks"><a href="#PS-Don&#x2019;t-be-afraid-to-call-out-some-exceptional-folks" class="headerlink" title="PS Don&#x2019;t be afraid to call out some exceptional folks "></a>PS Don&#x2019;t be afraid to call out some exceptional folks </h2><h2></h2><p>If you haven&#x2019;t been around MSP you wouldn&#x2019;t know that we&#x2019;ve had a few Moderators that have been around since basically the beginning helping out and making that place awesome.  The first three we&#x2019;ve had are still there day and night helping that place to grow and be awesome.  So, I just want to send some love to</p>
<p>@swelker101<br>@gmuxx<br>@sammosk</p>
<p>They&#x2019;re excellent examples of leadership.  And I&#x2019;m so happy to be on this journey with them.</p>
<p>Namaste Brothers.  Good Times!</p>

<p>So, a lot of people seem to think that I&#x2019;m a whale.  That&#x2019;s a misconception.  I&#x2019;m a Dolphin.  I&#x2019;m not even a particularly large dolphin.  That&#x2019;s because ball size is typically measured by SP.</p>
<h2 id="A-couple-ways-to-look-at-this-account"><a href="#A-couple-ways-to-look-at-this-account" class="headerlink" title="A couple ways to look at this account "></a>A couple ways to look at this account </h2><h2></h2><p>If you go by the standard-</p>
<p>Redfish 0-1000 SP<br>Minnow = 0-5000SP<br>Dolphin = 5000-50000SP<br>Whale= 50,000SP+</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m a dolphin.  I&#x2019;m not even that large of a dolphin because I&#x2019;m not that huge.  According to Steemwhales I&#x2019;m not even in the top 500 accounts on Steemit.</p>
<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-another-way-to-look"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-another-way-to-look" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s another way to look?  "></a>What&#x2019;s another way to look?  </h2><h2></h2><p>I like follower count generally.  I&#x2019;m floating around top 60 most followed accounts.  If you exclude all the people that just followed 40,000 people and now have 4000+ followers then I&#x2019;m in the top 40 most followed accounts.  Actually I think I might be personally responsible along with @jerrybanfield for the rise of those folks.  I wrote an article about the ways you get on the top 25 most followed list and mentioned spam f4f as an approach.  Now&#x2019;s there&#x2019;s 20 of them near the top of the list.  I also think Jerry has been actively encouraging the behavior.  Oh well.   Sorry guys.  For the record it is a pretty shitty way to get up on the top of the list.  You&#x2019;ll notice many of those accounts have thousands of followers and still accounts only worth $30.  It&#x2019;s probably not worth your time.</p>
<p>Anyway, all of that is to stay now that I&#x2019;m rockin&#x2019; close to 4,000 followers I&#x2019;m in the top most followed.</p>
<h2 id="The-Best-handle-for-figuring-out-long-term-success"><a href="#The-Best-handle-for-figuring-out-long-term-success" class="headerlink" title="The Best handle for figuring out long term success "></a>The Best handle for figuring out long term success </h2><h2></h2><p>I don&#x2019;t know any place that tracks this conveniently right now, but my favorite measurement of success is looking at the combined SP of all the people that follow you.  That gives you a sense of the long term trend you&#x2019;re likely up on.  So, yeah, having 4,000 brnad new minnows is neat and all, but I&#x2019;d rather have 1 whale droppin&#x2019; votes on my posts from a strict financial gain perspective.  It&#x2019;s the same with tracking this.  What you want to know is how big are the collective balls of all the people that read your posts.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s easy to do that in Discord rooms that use Banjo.  Just type $follows Steemitname and watch what it spits out.  The higher your value is the better off your long term success on the platform is looking.</p>
<h2 id="Anyway-I&#x2019;m-not-a-whale&#x2026;-yet"><a href="#Anyway-I&#x2019;m-not-a-whale&#x2026;-yet" class="headerlink" title="Anyway, I&#x2019;m not a whale&#x2026; yet "></a>Anyway, I&#x2019;m not a whale&#x2026; yet </h2><h2></h2><p>People seem to think I&#x2019;m a whale.  I&#x2019;m not.  I make decent money but I have a house, wife, and 2 kids.  So I basically have no spending cash for say 15 more years or more.  So, I can&#x2019;t just come in here and buy a shit ton of steem.  So, I have to do it modern way, which is posting for it.  I have around 20k steem.  I have purchased $2500 of steem, but the vast majority has come from author rewards.  Yes I have a big following.  Yes I helped create a minnow group and get some publicity for that.  Yes I am a witness.  Despite all of that.  I&#x2019;m not rich.  I&#x2019;m just a dude.  Just a medium sized dolphin.  I still got 30k Steem Power to earn before I&#x2019;m there.  It&#x2019;s gonna be a bit before I get my Whale Ball upgrades.</p>
<p>So, lots of people make this mistake when reaching out in Discord or Steemit chat.  I just wanted to clear it up.</p>
<h2 id="Witness-Side-Note"><a href="#Witness-Side-Note" class="headerlink" title="Witness Side Note "></a>Witness Side Note </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;ll probably do a full post on this laterz, but I&#x2019;m rocking 19.1 now.  Hopefully you stop seeing the broadcast error.  I got it once myself.  For the record @netuoso broke steemit.  For the record we didn&#x2019;t give him the Minnow Support Project Medal of Honor for that specific activity!  Fortunately, the devs and some really smart users fixed it in pretty close to record time, and now many of the witnesses are rockin&#x2019; the fix.  This place is stronger for having gone through that process.</p>

<p>One of the things that I&#x2019;ve noticed since I&#x2019;ve gotten here just under a year ago is the number of people with broken hearts or really rough stories.  I don&#x2019;t know if it&#x2019;s just the writing aspect of this platform or the supportive community or some combination of factors, but I&#x2019;ve seen a lot of heartbreak on here.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve heard stories of financial loss, mental illness, depression, alcoholism, drug abuse, sexual abuse, illness, western medicine induced injury, homelessness, death of close friends and family, and suicidal tendencies.  It&#x2019;s tough to read a lot of this, but I&#x2019;m also really stoked to see people trying to use this platform to heal.  I&#x2019;m equal parts sad to see so many people carrying such tragedy along with them, but I&#x2019;m also really happy that they have a place to air out their soul injuries.  I know I&#x2019;ve been remarkably touched by the ourpouring of support for folks going through tough times on more than one occasion.  </p>
<p>If you haven&#x2019;t seen it yet there is a thing called spiritscience on the web and there are a bunch of parables that the author created.    In the 2 minute video below  they talk about how things are neither good nor bad because you don&#x2019;t know what will happen as a result. I&#x2019;ve been able to find some peace contemplating this and my own hardships.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4ozP5fHebc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4ozP5fHebc</a></p>
<p>This thing has had a profound impact on my thinking on things.  Even things as difficult as the early death of my mother could fit into this.  You don&#x2019;t know what the long lasting impacts will be.  The universe unfolds as it should even when it sucks.  It&#x2019;s along the same lines as everything happens for a reason, but it&#x2019;s less about trying to determine the purpose of everything and more just floating as the universe flows past you rapids, eddies, and flow.  We&#x2019;re here to learn and experience not necessarily control.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#x2019;ve been thinking about this a lot as I keep meeting more and more people having a hard time.  I&#x2019;ll keep sending positive intention in the world for change and hope that my efforts expedite the transition to a world filled with peace, abundance, and liberty.  If your soul is hurting know I&#x2019;ll set my intention to spread reiki goodness to all who need it on steemit.</p>
<p>If you have a broken heart and a crushing story I hope you find solace and healing.  If you&#x2019;re bottling it up I think you&#x2019;ll find a receptive audience here if you&#x2019;re willing to talk about it positively and openly.  Hang in there I guess.  World seems to be in a transition state and hopefully before too long we&#x2019;ll have a different path we walk together.</p>

<p>I was gonna write a nice friendly Nagan VII post.  I was gonna write a milestone of how I got 100 witness votes in 2 days.  I was gonna drop some of my snark and post all friendly like, but apparently this is the week a lot of weird shit has to go down.</p>
<p>I get accused of running a scam out of Minnowsupport by someone that put in more than one post for STEEMFEST MINNOW (he retracted and put out an apology).  A witness voter of mine was frustrated with me for allowing dolphins to upvote themselves using the @minnowsupport community account.  And the final straw was getting called a libtard statist.</p>
<h2 id="Couple-things"><a href="#Couple-things" class="headerlink" title="Couple things "></a>Couple things </h2><h2></h2><p>The community account , @minnowsupport, is a cyborg.  There is a &#x201C;bot&#x201D; in Discord that has the posting key to @minnowsupport and can accept user commands to upvote posts.  People walk in there, register their account with the bot, and then use it to upvote their posts.  There is a trail in discord, and it leaves a comment on the post leaving a trail on the block.  It&#x2019;s a public bot.  There is a bot like aspect of a program used to vote, but every vote was cast by a human.  Everyone in this whole community is welcome to use it as long as they pay the $0.001 SBD/steem that we need as part of a transfer to register you.  The bot currently is used 1600 times a day by people that come into our discord, manually hit the command to vote, and either hang out and chill or leave for 12 hours until the timer resets.</p>
<p>I posted community guidelines, I posted a video from steemcleaners, and am going to put these things on the website coming out soon.  Those aren&#x2019;t community guidelines everyone in Steemit must follow because I run bartertown (Mad Max reference).  Instead those are the community standards if you want to use the public bot we manage.  We follow Steemit community standards and add &#x201C;No voting porn&#x201D; to the list.  That&#x2019;s it.  We have some young people in there and don&#x2019;t want a trail of porn upvotes.  I think it&#x2019;s pretty fuckin&#x2019; low bar stuff.</p>
<p>If you have a beef with how some dickwad misused a free public community bot I suggest taking it up with them.  Despite a couple posts to the contrary I&#x2019;m not a statist dickwad and I&#x2019;m not going to write in rules to limit how people use the bot.  If you don&#x2019;t like what they did then flag them.  If you&#x2019;re flagging because you don&#x2019;t like their opinion you might just stick your dick in a hornets nest of 3000+ people.  If you&#x2019;re flagging because they are just upvoting comment spam on their own shitpost you&#x2019;ll likly get 3000 people that think you&#x2019;re a champ for stopping abuse on the bot.  But don&#x2019;t look to me as a central authority to come in heavy handed.  That&#x2019;s not in the spirit of Steemit or in the spirit of a group called Peace, Abundance, and LIBERTY.</p>
<p>Also, about the dolphins that occasionally use it&#x2026; it&#x2019;s ok.  It&#x2019;s all ok.  First off the bot on a single vote is adding like 0.4sbd to a post.  Yes it has 110k delegated SP and about 4k of it&#x2019;s own, but it&#x2019;s used SIXTEEN HUNDRED TIMES A DAY.  So, the votes are small.  If there is abuse it&#x2019;s pretty minor and usually done by some minnow that&#x2019;s hasn&#x2019;t gotten over their dipshittery from other social sites.  More importantly though minnows need connections to other people if they&#x2019;re ever going to get out of minnowhood.  Would I prefer that whales don&#x2019;t come in and upvote themselves with the bot?  Yes!  Am I going to enforce that?  NO!  Because I want dolphins and whales to hang out with the minnows in the pond and if a 0.4SBD vote twice a day is enough to do that then by god vote away!</p>
<h2 id="This-ain&#x2019;t-yo-mama&#x2019;s-facebook"><a href="#This-ain&#x2019;t-yo-mama&#x2019;s-facebook" class="headerlink" title="This ain&#x2019;t yo mama&#x2019;s facebook "></a>This ain&#x2019;t yo mama&#x2019;s facebook </h2><h2></h2><p>See, this Steemit is &#x201C;run&#x201D; by a bunch of libertarian anarchist crazy people that think we should all be able to do as we want as long as we cause no harm.  It&#x2019;s do no harm, but take no shit.  These morons come over from Facebook and think that flag wars and trolling will get them places here.  It doesn&#x2019;t take long to earn a negative rep and lose all your post rewards.  You get that Magneto moment of &#x201C;What have I done!?!&#x201D;  Ultimately some of that is good for this community.  It&#x2019;s like our immunity to bullshit is working  (lookin at you Trainer), and also some of that is good because it means that people are learning about this place.</p>
<h2 id="We-have-an-obligation-to-teach-our-ways"><a href="#We-have-an-obligation-to-teach-our-ways" class="headerlink" title="We have an obligation to teach our ways "></a>We have an obligation to teach our ways </h2><h2></h2><p>Hopefully people show a little restraint and patience though for these idiots that come over here.  yes, they are annoying as fuck, but we have a world to change.  I&#x2019;m not sure we want to spend all of our voting power nuking minnow idiots into the ground.  That probably won&#x2019;t help our brand nor bring many new users to our platform to drive up the demand for steem and thus send us to the moon.  So, I urge everyone to teach peace, teach how this place is different, and give these people a least a shot or two to figure it out.  We need those idiots to come here, learn, and become advocates for this place and the ways of Steemit.  We don&#x2019;t need them to come here, get nuked, and spread shit about us.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I could run around removing every single upvote and policing every single shitpost that catches 0.4 sbd from us, but I&#x2019;m not going to kneejerk react and put rules all over this project or become the police I can&#x2019;t stand.  5 votes out of 1600 go bad.  If we have constant abuse from an individual I&#x2019;m going to root it out.  Otherwise, it&#x2019;s on this whole community to police shit.  Just make sure you&#x2019;re in the right before you start flagging because it usually leads to unintended consequences.</p>
<h2 id="I&#x2019;m-a-scammer"><a href="#I&#x2019;m-a-scammer" class="headerlink" title="I&#x2019;m a scammer "></a>I&#x2019;m a scammer </h2><h2></h2><p>Let&#x2019;s talk about this too.  If Minnow Support is a get rich quick scheme it&#x2019;s the worst fucking one I could envision.  I spend about 4-5 hours a day trying to work on various aspects of this project.  I get mods.  I recruit people.  I write witness posts.  I run bots.  I manage some finances, I answer questions from 3000 minnows, and I answer questions in steemit chat and Discord all day.  I talk to other witnesses to try to figure out what we need to do about inflation, block size, error messages, recruiting, hardforks and other shit.  We&#x2019;re building bots, websites, and a radio station.  Currently after 2 months of this I now witness 28 blocks.   That&#x2019;s about 26 steem and about $26.  I&#x2019;m making less than mimimum wage for this.  Also, that doesn&#x2019;t include the expenses taht I pay out of my pocket typically and give to @minnowsupport.  I&#x2019;m net negative on the whole project and you can check my transfers to see that money is going from @aggroed to @minnowsupport and I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s a single case of it going the other way.</p>
<p>I generally don&#x2019;t even use the bot I helped create, but occasionally I do upvote myself 100% when it&#x2019;s community related and I&#x2019;m trying to get the post a good start.  I don&#x2019;t know how many times i&#x2019;ve done this.  Maybe 3-4 in 1 month.  </p>
<p>What about &#x201C;this whole thing is a giant project just to get votes?&#x201D;  Well, it&#x2019;s not entirely false.  It&#x2019;s my witness project.  It&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m doing to deserve to be a witness.  But the voting is a consequence of fighting for a bigger deal.  If you&#x2019;ve read any of my previous shit you&#x2019;d know that I&#x2019;m a pretty dedicated truther that thinks steemit is about the best antidote out there to fiat money created by debt by shiteating banksters that rule the world.  I&#x2019;m doing this because I&#x2019;m a passionate advocate for peace, abundance, and liberty and want the world to change.  I think Steemit can play a great role in that mission so I promote this place and use my time to growth hack it and support the minnows that do come over.  Witness votes are a cool side effect of the work I do here.  But it&#x2019;s not worth the minimum wage I get from witnessing.  Now, if I became a witness and then started doing nothing and just collected some steem power everyday for jack shit&#x2026; well that&#x2019;s a different issue.</p>
<p>So, if Minnowsupport is a scam.  It&#x2019;s gotta be the shittiest time eating, low wage, constantly bombarded with questions, kinda shitscam ever created.  Add in the fact that it&#x2019;s run by 6 witnesses and has had visits from multiple top witnesses checking it out, we seem to be a spawning ground for another 6+ witnesses and hopefully you get the idea that we are a positive force for good for the platform rather than a bunch of scammers draining the reward pool 0.4SBD at a time by giving it away to anyone in the public.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-benefit-of-Minnow-Support"><a href="#the-real-benefit-of-Minnow-Support" class="headerlink" title="the real benefit of Minnow Support "></a>the real benefit of Minnow Support </h2><h2></h2><p>The irony of all of it is that the real benefit comes from the community aspect.  It wasn&#x2019;t the .4 SBD bot that got our people into trending or several hundred votes.  It was the fact that people hang out all the time, make friends, and use those connections to get their material out into the world.  People come for the bots, but quickly learn the community aspect of what we&#x2019;ve built together is infinitely more important.  That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re sitting on 200 delegations for around 140k SP total from some highly ethical mothafuckahs.  It&#x2019;s cause we do good.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion "></a>Conclusion </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;m not a statist.  I&#x2019;m not running a scam.  Minnow Support isn&#x2019;t a scam.  I&#x2019;m not going to add more rules to how a completely public account operates.  If you have beef feel free to add it in a comment below, change your witness votes, or start flagging muh posts.  And even when you do&#x2026; I&#x2019;m still just gonna keep doin&#x2019; what I&#x2019;m doin&#x2019; because it&#x2019;s helping a lot of people.  I&#x2019;m operating my mission statement of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty as best as I can.  </p>
<h2 id="Anybody-else-got-a-beef-with-me-this-week"><a href="#Anybody-else-got-a-beef-with-me-this-week" class="headerlink" title="Anybody else got a beef with me this week? "></a>Anybody else got a beef with me this week? </h2><h2></h2><p>I try to pack all my negative energy into one shitty week.  So, if you have any other accusations you&#x2019;d like to lob at Minnow Support or me personally I&#x2019;d love for you to take this time right meow and do it publicly here in these comments.  If you would like to share some positive non-scammy experieces as a counter to fears and misunderstandings that&#x2019;d be swell to.</p>
<p>Comment responses  delayed as I have to start work.</p>

<p>Sit around my children and let me tell you of a time when Steem was so low that all the people just in it for the money wrote up a nice long post about how they were leaving the platform.  Many moons ago, approximately seven months ago or around then, the price of steem dropped.  It was almost as if the force of infinite inflation was too much for the little platform to bear.  Those that had steem found they had so much more steem, but those that relied on post rewards found themselves making little more than pennies and the inflation didn&#x2019;t really impact how much steem they had.  It was a dark time for steemit bloggers.  An eeiry and lonesome time as many posters at that precise moment decided to write up some heartbreaking story of why they were leaving and often cried about how horrible their experience had been.</p>
<p>With the price of Steem falling again (most likely based on the value of BTC falling, which in turn is tied to the risk of SEGWIT due in a few weeks) I thought I would offer an opportunity to help a few people leave (again?) who are only interested in this place when the rewards are high.  To that end I thought I would write their ragequitting letter for them so as to hasten their departure.  Since more than one person is likely to leave I thought I&#x2019;d just help you all so that you have a form you can use.  I present to you:  </p>
<h2 id="Steemit-Ragequit-Madlibs"><a href="#Steemit-Ragequit-Madlibs" class="headerlink" title="Steemit Ragequit Madlibs "></a>Steemit Ragequit Madlibs </h2><h2></h2><p>Dear Steemit (synonym for community or colleagues),</p>
<p>I have decided today now that the price of steem has dropped to <strong>___</strong> that I will no longer work for (offensive adjective describing low) wages and have decided it&#x2019;s time for me (synonym for to leave).  While I have been able to find a few good conversations with (insert names of a handful of authors you probably didn&#x2019;t care for anyway) I have been (synonym for shocked) by how little this (synonym for community) undervalues my (flowery adjectives) work.</p>
<p>When I first got here I was filled with (positive emotion), but it quickly turned to (negative emotion) when I realized how much (synonym for work) I would have to do on this platform to get anywhere.  I thought within (unrealistic short time frame) that people would recognize my (flowery) talent for (writing, music, art, blogging, politics, bullshit), but alas Steemit didn&#x2019;t immediately respond to my articles on (insert niche and unimportant article tags).  So, while I have been (synonym for diligent) working to grow my account I&#x2019;ve become so frustrated by how I have barely anything to show for it.  It&#x2019;s even worse now that steem is down to <strong>__</strong>.</p>
<p>I (synonym for refuse) to work on my (shit you did while here) for this platform any longer!  I&#x2019;m going to go back to (other social media company) and will continue to spread my (flowery langauge) content there where I know I&#x2019;m (synonym for recognized or valued).  I can&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;m sorry it&#x2019;s come to this, but clearly if my posts aren&#x2019;t making (insert unrealistically high value here) dollars every time then it&#x2019;s just not worth my time.</p>
<p>You can find me at (insert links no one will click) here.  I wish it could have been different.</p>

<p>HF20 will come eventually and with it the need for a new way to onboard people into steemit.  The standard faucet hasn&#x2019;t been a great solution as several have taken advantage of it.  There may be some 40,000 accounts that existed simply to drain 6 steem each from the opening.  In order to combat that in the short run wait times have been increased and onboarding people may take as long as two weeks and still costs steem.  It&#x2019;s less than ideal.</p>
<h2 id="A-great-solution"><a href="#A-great-solution" class="headerlink" title="A great solution "></a>A great solution </h2><h2></h2><p>The Steemit team has come up with a plan to create tokens that can be used to create new accounts.  They note in the blog in order to reach the heights of Reddit they will have to climb the mountain of new users that would come on board.  To bring 100 million people they would currently need hundreds of millions of steem.  Considering only two hundred and fifty million steem even exist the challenge is formidable.  And so they thought up a token system and would use those tokens specifically as a way to add people to the platform.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to add a daily quota of discounted accounts. These accounts can be paid for with a combination of STEEM, bandwidth, and mining. Yes, mining. We believe that the ability to mine an account into creation was a fantastic feature of our hybrid proof of work system that was lost when we removed proof of work. Mining will use Litecoin&#x2019;s scrypt algorithm as it is battle tested. This will only be used for creating accounts through the discount system and not for block production.</p>
<p>The level of discount will be dynamic based on current demand to prevent all of the accounts from being created instantly. Witnesses will vote on the daily quota so that we can scale this system alongside our growth. This system will run in parallel to existing account creation.</p>
</blockquote>

That to me is a great travesty.  While I myself mine and enjoy it quite a bit I&#x2019;m not inclined to believe it is an approach that leads to equality and a healthy distribution of steem on the system.  This is especially important on a platform already plagued by a terrible distribution.</p>
<p>My article on @freedom helped me reach this conclusion.  If those that mine have the ability to make 6M steem and those that don&#x2019;t know can&#x2019;t mine then it creates an inherently dangerous situation for equality.  Maybe some folks aren&#x2019;t concerned, or would share that it&#x2019;s a problem that Cryto has always had, but those people aren&#x2019;t working to grow 3,000 minnow accounts.  My concern is for the everyday people of this platform.  We need to appeal to Joe the Plumber and not just Linda the Linux admin.  If you want to grow and you want to grow fairly then I don&#x2019;t like this aspect of the plan.</p>
<p>When I asked about it one answer was that&#x2019;s it&#x2019;s easy to just go through cli_wallet and mine.  For a dev that might be easy, but for the moms and dads of facebook you&#x2019;re trying to bring over you might as well ask them to rewire their house.  I have minnows that can&#x2019;t register with a Discord bot after 5 attempts and who couldn&#x2019;t figure out if they had successfully voted for my witness when I was below 50.  While a handful of people may be able to figure mining on the platform the result will be a new avenue for distorted wealth creation will arise.  Even worse there&#x2019;s the potential that Steemit may pick which groups will be able to use these tokens or make them non-transferable so that only those who mine may benefit perpetually excluding those that aren&#x2019;t born or trained to the technocracy.</p>
<h2 id="An-alternative-Stake-weighted-voting-a-la-Witness-Voting"><a href="#An-alternative-Stake-weighted-voting-a-la-Witness-Voting" class="headerlink" title="An alternative: Stake weighted voting a la Witness Voting.  "></a>An alternative: Stake weighted voting a la Witness Voting.  </h2><h2></h2><p>Stake weighted voting is one of the greatest ideas that&#x2019;s come along in governance.  It&#x2019;s far better to allow the community to decide where the tokens should go than to allow the limited few with mining competence to bear all the benefit.  The chain and the witnesses can tweak how many new tokens need to be created to have a healthy supply, and a new group of token generators can be voted on to decide who will receive the tokens.  I imagine a system where some 1000 or even more people could be voted in and earning a stake weighted proportion of fungible new account tokens. </p>
<p>Instead of having these in the hands of just a few miners and developers these tokens could be in the accounts of thousands of users who can then grant access and use their network to invite new users.  This could be a decentralized system for account creation.  Otherwise you&#x2019;re allowing a handful of web developers to have access to account creation which by your own math you value in the hundreds of millions.  How is that in the best interest of the Minnows in the Pond?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We expect the majority of accounts to be created by Steemit and our partners cheaply using stake. The account creation process will appear similar to what it is today with a fee and proof of work field. To create an account via stake, all the creator needs to do is not include a fee or a proof of work. If the creating account does not have enough stake they will need to include an adequate proof of work or STEEM fee to cover the difference. We will provide APIs and tools to calculate how much of a fee is necessary. To create an account without a creator, no creator will be specified in the operation and will include a proof of work adequate to cover the entire fee. If the dynamic cost is too high, regular account creation will be an option. <strong>To end users, this will appear identical to what it is today and only affects developers wishing to sign up new users.</strong></p>
