<h2 id="Removing-Consent"><a href="#Removing-Consent" class="headerlink" title="Removing Consent"></a>Removing Consent</h2><p>When you fight something you are actually acknowledging that it has power over you.<br>In a sense, this is a form of consent.</p>
<p>Completely removing consent involves dropping all energetic signatures that you might be feeding into it in order to not give it any power.</p>
<p>This is why it is said that the opposite of love is not hate, it is apathy.</p>

<p>There is no need to fly a drone over some Third World country, dropping bombs and killing innocent people.<br>But this has become acceptable to us because we have been fed these lies since childhood.</p>
<p>This is not by accident. It has been purposely designed in order to control the masses by way of fear.<br>When there is an external threat, it is a lot easier to control people.<br>This has been happening since Ancient Roman times and still continues today.</p>

<p><strong>Forced freedom&#x2026;is not freedom!</strong></p>
<p>Those in power <strong>must</strong> create wars in order to  justify the gross amount of military spending.<br>We have billions of dollars for unnecessary weaponry, yet we don&#x2019;t have the money to take care of our own soldiers&#x2026;.or the millions of Americans currently living in poverty.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve heard about the Steemit ninja mine for a long time.  I was on the platform at the time there was mining occuring, but I wasn&#x2019;t yet saavy enough to know how to do it or even bother to do it.  Steemit was my first foray into crypto.  So, there wasn&#x2019;t much to go on.  That said, I&#x2019;ve heard about this &#x201C;ninja mine&#x201D; for the 1.5 years that I&#x2019;ve been around here.  </p>
<h2 id="What-is-the-ninja-mine"><a href="#What-is-the-ninja-mine" class="headerlink" title="What is the ninja mine? "></a>What is the ninja mine? </h2><h2></h2><p>Actually, there&#x2019;s something before that.  The restart.  So, let&#x2019;s start there.</p>
<h2 id="Steem-was-launched-and-there-was-a-bug"><a href="#Steem-was-launched-and-there-was-a-bug" class="headerlink" title="Steem was launched and there was a bug "></a>Steem was launched and there was a bug </h2><h2></h2><p>So, Steem was launched and there was a bug in the code.  It made them want to restart fresh.  So, they did that&#x2026; actually let&#x2019;s go further back.</p>
<h2 id="Steem-was-a-blockchain-that-was-about-to-be-launched"><a href="#Steem-was-a-blockchain-that-was-about-to-be-launched" class="headerlink" title="Steem was a blockchain that was about to be launched "></a>Steem was a blockchain that was about to be launched </h2><h2></h2><p>Dan and Ned did this funny thing.  They told everyone they could mine Steem, but barely said much more than that.  They gave advice here and there, but basically didn&#x2019;t tell anyone much about it.  The reason they did this was to get around the ICO laws.  They didn&#x2019;t want to make it look like a security so they didn&#x2019;t promise anything.  They also didn&#x2019;t really want the whole world mining, but they went through mining to make it legal to do an ICO without doing an ICO.  So, the people that could mine this thing were a handful of devs that were reading the old bitcointalk forums, Steemit, and Steemit employees.</p>
<h2 id="They-launched-under-those-pretenses"><a href="#They-launched-under-those-pretenses" class="headerlink" title="They launched under those pretenses "></a>They launched under those pretenses </h2><h2></h2><p>Within 1 day they found a bug.  Rather than hardfork to fix it they simply restarted the coin.  That pissed off the people who were already mining it.  It started a rough reputation for Steemit with the investor community.  It looked to some like they had competition for the coin so they rebooted to scare people off.  Dan doesn&#x2019;t seem the type for that, so I&#x2019;m betting it was a legit code bug&#x2026; I mean, Steem&#x2019;s had those before&#x2026; but it left some early miners with a bad taste in their mouths.  The argument became why mine if these assholes are just going to reboot the coin if they don&#x2019;t win the mining war.  When people don&#x2019;t trust Steemit I think it starts with this mining plan and this reboot.</p>
<h2 id="Ok-next-up-there-was-mining-for-months"><a href="#Ok-next-up-there-was-mining-for-months" class="headerlink" title="Ok, next up there was mining for months "></a>Ok, next up there was mining for months </h2><h2></h2><p>Steemit, employees, and a handful of other miners were mining the coin.  Mining it turned out produced an assload of stake.  More than posting even with random $40k makeup tutorial posts getting out there.  In order to mine you had to have a lot of different accounts.  So, the mining accounts were all over the place.  Steemit was the heaviest miner, but after they gather up 70% of the minable steem stake they quit mining and let a handful of other devs catch up and take it.  Eventually they stopped the mining altogether.</p>
<h2 id="What-did-they-accomplish"><a href="#What-did-they-accomplish" class="headerlink" title="What did they accomplish? "></a>What did they accomplish? </h2><h2></h2><p>Steemit seemed to have wanted a majority stake in the coin without it being a security or without it seeming like it was handed out and represented ownership or something like that.  It was literally one type of work around to the laws.  So, they made it so they could ICO without actually ICOing.  The challenge it created was a truly warped distribution.  Now there&#x2019;s 100 accounts with 93% of the Steem.  When I look around and see problems on the platform I mostly think it&#x2019;s related to distribution on the network.  </p>
<h2 id="EOS"><a href="#EOS" class="headerlink" title="EOS "></a>EOS </h2><h2></h2><p>EOS seems to have a slightly more elegant solution by allowing daily purchases open to anyone.  They explicitly didn&#x2019;t make any promises to again avoid being a security and to claim it&#x2019;s a utility token.  In this case Dan now had enough money to straight up buy his own coin at release allowing him a larger stake of the &#x201C;utility&#x201D; token.  This seems more fair than making it so any devs are the miners which means only devs are the whales, which means curation on the platform gets really wonky too.</p>
<h2 id="EOS-Steem-Competitor"><a href="#EOS-Steem-Competitor" class="headerlink" title="EOS Steem Competitor? "></a>EOS Steem Competitor? </h2><h2></h2><p>Dan&#x2019;s coming out and saying that they&#x2019;ll create a Steem competitor on EOS.  Seems interesting.  Dan is pretty convinced that only a community with true identities known by everyone will work out.  So, he seems to implicate there will be trusted oracles or something like it that will make sure everyone is a true and verified person.  Maybe that&#x2019;s birth certs?  IDK.  I prefer psuedoanonymity.  I think it&#x2019;s enough to know what actions Aggroed is taking without have a crypto probing my terrestrial privates.</p>
<h2 id="Anyway-a-lot-of-investors-got-pissed-about-this-whole-thing"><a href="#Anyway-a-lot-of-investors-got-pissed-about-this-whole-thing" class="headerlink" title="Anyway, a lot of investors got pissed about this whole thing.  "></a>Anyway, a lot of investors got pissed about this whole thing.  </h2><h2></h2><p>Frankly though, after taking a week or so to investigate this thing I mostly walk away thinking Ned and Dan aren&#x2019;t the complete dicks they are made out to be.  If anything the government seems to be the asshole.  Their need to control how ICOs are managed created the need for this work around, which resulted in a totally fucked distribution.  I know it was partially their intention to have a large stake and be Steem blockchain kings, but like we&#x2019;re seeing it mostly seems like benevolent dictators who choose not to intervene (much).  IDK, I wasn&#x2019;t in the room at the time the decision was made, but I guess I&#x2019;m a little less fuming mad about the distribution around here and now mostly hope that the market recovers enough to make some of these investors choose to divest to a little more reasonable percentage of blockchain ownership.  Then again&#x2026; I keep saying Steem&#x2019;s gonna hit $50 by the end of the year, and it&#x2019;s the most undervalued blockchain around.

<p>Today is a special edition of Meme the News.  We&#x2019;ll look at recent public actions in light of the Fisa Memo and link them together with some anonymous sources and memes describing what&#x2019;s going on.  Maybe this is an actual take down of criminals in government with consequences for these actions.  We&#x2019;ll see in the coming days.  For now it&#x2019;s just memes and images and a chance to ponder.</p>

<p>I worked in the corporate world for nearly a decade doing sales and marketing.  One of the key things about learning how to market is understanding who your target audience for your product is.  You&#x2019;re on Steem with some idea of wanting to grow your account, get noticed, and have a better life than what the fiat world can offer.  To know how to do that it helps to know who is represented on the platform.</p>
<h2 id="Four-Stakeholder-Groups"><a href="#Four-Stakeholder-Groups" class="headerlink" title="Four Stakeholder Groups "></a>Four Stakeholder Groups </h2><h2></h2><p>Right now I can think of four stakeholder groups and they all have a different footprint and needs on the platform.  I think of them as investors, devs, content creators, and merchants.  Collectively that covers nearly everyone that&#x2019;s on here.</p>
<h2 id="Investors"><a href="#Investors" class="headerlink" title="Investors"></a>Investors</h2><p>These guys have a lot of Steem.  They are an important and powerful minority.  Back when Steem was launched Dan and Ned were trying to figure out how to do an ICO legally without the need for registration etc.  They settled on an approach that involved telling people they could mine publicly, but not giving a lot of info on how to do it.  The people that knew them spent money mining.  Others came too and they all have a lot of stake now.  Some have millions of Steem.  There aren&#x2019;t many of these accounts.  As it stands roughly 93% of the Steem is in the hands of roughly 100 accounts.  Most of them mined it, but many bought in as well.  The folks that are active non-selfish curators are often looking for what is adding value to the platform.  They upvote posts that get eyeballs, dazzle with content, do something cool, or seem to support really good people.</p>
<h2 id="Devs"><a href="#Devs" class="headerlink" title="Devs"></a>Devs</h2><p>While there&#x2019;s a lot of overlap with the whale catagory there are also a fair number of Steem poor devs too.  These are folks that came in after mining was closed and didn&#x2019;t have a chance to mine.  They have skills and can make projects for the blockchain.  They can code a million apps, but many aren&#x2019;t social creatures.  Many prefer linux coding to human interaction.  Some have art or music skills and many do not.  If you&#x2019;re looking to attract and build a relationship with devs consider ways that you can help them achieve their goals first and then follow up by asking for programming favors later.</p>
<h2 id="Bloggers-and-content-creators"><a href="#Bloggers-and-content-creators" class="headerlink" title="Bloggers and content creators"></a>Bloggers and content creators</h2><p>This is the majority of people on the platform everyday.  Right now there&#x2019;s about 60k active accounts per day.  Most of them are people (and bots) writing content and trying to get noticed by literally anyone.  Many come from third world nations that are fairly poor, but they themselves are lucky enough to have food, water, internet, and a phone.  These people are the bread and butter from an activity standpoint, but from a wealth standpoint forget it.  They basically have no steem.  If you&#x2019;re trying to get in with this crowd try to figure out ways to help them grow their account through tools or communities.</p>
<h2 id="Merchants"><a href="#Merchants" class="headerlink" title="Merchants"></a>Merchants</h2><p>This is a nearly non-existent group today, but will eventually form the hardened middle class of the Steem platform. As more people come here to blog more businesses are setup to help them.  Programs specific to this platform to take payment, form community, track data, and a million other things are coming.  When people show up businesses come too.  While this is a minority now figuring out a tool that will help them will help you as well.</p>
<h2 id="So&#x2026;"><a href="#So&#x2026;" class="headerlink" title="So&#x2026;. "></a>So&#x2026;. </h2><h2></h2><p>There&#x2019;s your target audiences.  As you&#x2019;re building and doing things on this platform think to yourself what will Bobby the Blogger need or Danny the Dev.  Try to think of things that you have struggled with, find the pain point, come up with a solution, and then start on a small scale implementing it.  That&#x2019;s how I think you can grow around these blocks.</p>

<p>This is the daily AgX chart for today 2018-02-07.<br>Today&#x2019;s AgX factor is 0.96 for a STEEM/SBD ratio of 1.2.</p><h3>What is AgX?</h3><br><br>The Mayer&#x2019;s multiple (200 days moving average of the BTC/USD price) is known to be a good indicator of the BTC price evolution.<br>AgX aims to be a similar indicator regarding the STEEM/SBD ratio, in order for users to find the right moment to exchange their SBD for STEEM at the best possible rate.<p></p>
<h2 id="Plan"><a href="#Plan" class="headerlink" title="Plan "></a>Plan </h2><h2></h2><p>I&#x2019;ll make these posts on @aggroed for the next week or so and then move them over to a new account.  It&#x2019;s possible it won&#x2019;t matter in the long run if SBD is ever completely pegged, but until then the prices move and hopefully this informs some good decision making.</p>

<p>So, yesterday I bought the dip.  I kinda screwed up my buy ladder, but I tossed one in when we dropped under the support line that has held since early January.  I wish I had reversed my buy amounts, but other than that I think it&#x2019;s ok.</p>
<p>I bought a total of $18k of litecoin.</p>
<p>I was mostly watching the btc charts.  </p>
<p>I bought $5k at 8k btc<br>I bought $5k at 7.5k btc<br>I bought $5k at 7k btc<br>I bought $2k at 6.8k btc<br>and bought $1k at 6.2k btc</p>
<p>My overall average price for ltc is $134.  It&#x2019;s currently $153 and may actually break out of the resistance.  I say that because of BTC looks like it has free range to go up another $1k or more.</p>

<p>Looks like btc broke through the most recent resistance trend line and is heading up to the one that we&#x2019;ve been riding for a month (a crypto eternity).</p>

<p>After just watching my Pats lose I keep thinking about this as a running back trying to break through various parts of the zone defense.  Looks like btc just broke through the defensive line with breaching the recent resistance line, and now gets a few extra yards in before getting to the linebackers waiting for him at 9.4k btc or so.</p>
<p>This might also all be garbage and markets just move regardless of what charts show.  Still learning.</p>
<p>Anyway, I feel like a champ right this second except for the fact that I get half my purchase on the 10th, and rest by the 14th.  1 week right now could send that value fucking anywhere&#x2026;  Fucking killing me to make a good buy and lose the opportunity because coinbase taking a week is going to kick my ass&#x2026;  I&#x2019;m hoping for an LTC breakout today as btc drives up another 1300 or so until it meets the primary resistance line.</p>
