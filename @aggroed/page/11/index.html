<p>Steem-engine.com aims to be the number one site in the world for cryptocurrency enthusiasts to launch their ICOs and STOs.</p>
<p>We have some great news coming up this week regarding SCOT and Legal services, but before we get there I just wanted to share some news regarding our first airdrop!</p>
<h2 id="Clean-Planet"><a href="#Clean-Planet" class="headerlink" title="Clean Planet"></a>Clean Planet</h2><p>I&#x2019;m happy to announce that with a small donation of 100 ENG and some time spent by @inertia helping them @cleanplanet was able to complete the first airdrop of a token on Steem-Engine.com.</p>
<p>You can check it out yourself on the block explorer @inertia built here: <a href="https://steem-engine.rocks/@cleanplanet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steem-engine.rocks/@cleanplanet</a></p>
<p>There were a few hundred recipients of the airdrop.  Congratulations to everyone who received them, congrats to the @cleanplanet team, and many thanks to @inertia!</p>

We&#x2019;ll have a post on that Monday!</p>
<p>Before May or right at the start of May we should be up and running with a new service - Novel Distribution: Smart Contract Organizational Token AKA ND SCOT.  We&#x2019;ll essentially be running something akin to a voting bot that will transfer tokens to users based on stake weight and VP, but for Smart Engine tokens.  It&#x2019;s modelled after the SMT protocol.  We&#x2019;re trying to get community tokens launched ASAP.  If you&#x2019;ve dreamed of starting your own community and having it backed by it&#x2019;s own token this will be your chance!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Problem: determining the reputation and consensus on community member value is hard and currently not very meaningful<br>Vision: Stake based voting on community chosen attributes<br>Objective: Implement ever living polls per account per community<br>Mission: Enable communities to self assess the &#x201C;reputation&#x201D; or value a member brings to a community via stake weighted voting</p>
<h2 id="The-failure-of-reputation-1-0"><a href="#The-failure-of-reputation-1-0" class="headerlink" title="The failure of reputation 1.0"></a>The failure of reputation 1.0</h2><p>If you look at the top of your personal page you&#x2019;ll see a number up there that represents your reputation on the platform.  Anytime you try to boil a lot of things down to 1 number it&#x2019;s going to have flaws, but reputation is particularly flawed.  </p>
<p>The number lives off chain and it&#x2019;s largely based on the upvotes you&#x2019;ve received.  If the upvotes came from people with high reputation and they had a lot of stake weight your scores would improve a lot.  If on the other hand the votes were from low stake and unknown accounts your score wouldn&#x2019;t move much.  Flags can bring it down.</p>
<p>Reputation 1.0 was gamed from the beginning because a lot of early stake was mined, the mined stake was delegated, and the delegated mined stake had a very heavy influence on rep scores to start.  It wasn&#x2019;t a level playing field for everyone that wanted to play.  Winners were picked and then because of how exponential voting used to work everyone would pig pile onto those posts to maximize curation rewards.  It lead to a pretty shitty distribution of rewards with a 10-30 authors getting the lion share of posts rewards</p>
<p>Linear rewards came along and screwed rep even more.  Linear rewards made it so that bid bots could exist.  In a sense bidbots already existed because users had been selling votes without them, but it wasn&#x2019;t open or transparent.  Ok, so now the bid botts accumulate a ton of Steem Power and if you choose to spend a few hundred sbd you could rapidly change your reputation.  Buying your rep seems like a terrible way to have a community get a sense of your value to a community or how well your values mesh with a community.</p>
<h2 id="Higher-Education-and-Mastery-Scores"><a href="#Higher-Education-and-Mastery-Scores" class="headerlink" title="Higher Education and Mastery Scores"></a>Higher Education and Mastery Scores</h2><p>This is one of the few times being a chemical education minded PhD chemist comes in handy&#x2026; So bear with me a second.</p>
<p>The whole education movement has been trying to get a much clearer picture of the abilities of students for decades.  If you get a 64 on a test what does it mean?  Are you all around a weak student?  Was that the best grade in the class at that time?  Were there some skills you excelled at and others where you couldn&#x2019;t do the basics?  A single number isn&#x2019;t very useful.</p>
<p>So, the education movement looks towards learning outcomes and &#x201C;mastery scores.&#x201D;  A professor would go through the questions their students have to take and determine what the question is really asking about.  Is it math?  Reading? Vocabulary? Particular skills? And as you ask the question a program tracking your answers starts figuring out how well you&#x2019;re doing not just as a whole, but for each particular thing you&#x2019;re being assessed on.</p>
<p>Your 64 becomes a 15/23 for reading, a 19/43 for math, 30/34 for skills assessment.  Now as a professor or instructor you know that particular kid is a weak reader, sucks at math, but has the vast majority of a subset of skills.</p>
<p>Both the total value and the sub-scores have a lot more meaning now!</p>
<h2 id="Community-Derived-Reputation-through-Stake-based-voting-and-ever-living-polls"><a href="#Community-Derived-Reputation-through-Stake-based-voting-and-ever-living-polls" class="headerlink" title="Community Derived Reputation through Stake based voting and ever living polls"></a>Community Derived Reputation through Stake based voting and ever living polls</h2><p>There&#x2019;s a team of people that manage the PALnet Discord and Minnow Support Project.  The first mission of MSP is to spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.  So, let&#x2019;s say we launch a token on Steem-engine or later SMTs.  Those tokens get distributed.  We work with the hive mind/stratos/communities developers and get a MSP community page.  The administrators/mods/witnesses set 5 categories that we&#x2019;re going to track for all of our community members:</p>
<ol>
<li>Peaceful</li>
<li>Liberty Minded</li>
<li>Abundant</li>
<li>Troll</li>
<li>Harmful</li>
</ol>
<p>So, now on every person&#x2019;s page you&#x2019;re able to at least upvote, possibly downvote, each of these categories for your fellows.  It&#x2019;s like link&#x2019;d in skills verification, but for values rather than individual skills.</p>
<p>So, I interact with the community for a while and people start voting on my values.  After 3 months others have weighed in.</p>
<p>(Nerdy note: voting like this is often based on vests. Vests represent actual ownership where as Power represents what&#x2019;s you&#x2019;re holding right that minute.  So, the vote totals below are tracked based on the vests you hold for individual Steem engine tokens or SMTs)</p>
<p>7B Vests peaceful<br>6.2B vests Liberty Minded<br>9B vests Abundant<br>3.5B vests Troll<br>0.4B vests harmful</p>
<p>So, that&#x2019;s the raw data, then we can do things like figure out what rank would that put me for Peaceful?  The most peaceful, the least?  I could show it as a percent of the total that&#x2019;s voting.  So, 7B vests of 7B vests voting would give a 100% score, but 7B of 35B vests would give a score of 20%.  So, now I have a few ways to view the and get a sense of where I&#x2019;m falling in the community.  </p>
<p>Then we could also get a single number too if we want.  We take the positive scores and add them up, and subtract the negative scores.  Maybe they aren&#x2019;t all weighted equally, so being a troll is a negative, but being harmful is extremely negative.&#x2028;&#x2028;So here I would get something like 7B+6.2B+9B-3.5B-4B(times 10 cause it&#x2019;s weighted heavily on the backend)= 14.7B vests and when tracked as a percent of the total that gets me to something like the 92 percentile.</p>
<p>Now you have a general community score for me of 92% (I bet Crimmy gets a 99 or 100% that over achiever).  You can also know it&#x2019;s coming from my Peacefulness, Liberty mindedness, Abundance, trolling, and the harm I cause and to what degree those are impacting it.</p>
<p>But it&#x2019;s also an ever living poll, so as people change their behaviors you can adjust your sentiment towards them.  Start acting like an asshole and get value scores reflecting people thinking you are one.</p>
<h2 id="A-community-page"><a href="#A-community-page" class="headerlink" title="A community page"></a>A community page</h2><p>So, somewhere there&#x2019;s a &#x201C;leaderboard&#x201D; and I can go through and see how community members in the community are voting for others.  Then as I think &#x201C;I&#x2019;d like to get into some kind of partnership or relationship with another person&#x201D; they&#x2019;re already somewhat vetted based off of group criteria that the community itself values.</p>
<h2 id="What-might-Steemit-look-like"><a href="#What-might-Steemit-look-like" class="headerlink" title="What might Steemit look like?"></a>What might Steemit look like?</h2><p>The categories I&#x2019;d suggest are:<br>Active member<br>Community Manager<br>Developer<br>Business Manager<br>Investor<br>Trustworthy<br>Troll</p>
<p>And again, at a glance you can get a sense of what the rest of the community thinks someone adds to the community.  Then you could go looking for individual people.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusions"><a href="#Conclusions" class="headerlink" title="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h2><p>By combining vested tokens, with ever living polling, and the communities feature it&#x2019;s possible for a community manager to assign values/attributes that individual communities can track and then stake holders can vote on them.  The values could be displayed showing community consensus on the what a person brings to the community as valued by that community.</p>
<p>Should be fun!</p>
<h2 id="Also-I&#x2019;m-not-proposing-to-build-this-myself"><a href="#Also-I&#x2019;m-not-proposing-to-build-this-myself" class="headerlink" title="Also, I&#x2019;m not proposing to build this myself"></a>Also, I&#x2019;m not proposing to build this myself</h2><p>So, here&#x2019;s to the communities minded guys looking to remake the world through individual communities.  I&#x2019;m just tossing ideas and geeking out about it a little.</p>
<h2 id="What-might-it-look-like"><a href="#What-might-it-look-like" class="headerlink" title="What might it look like?"></a>What might it look like?</h2><p>Here&#x2019;s a starting mockup.  It&#x2019;s factually wrong, but it doens&#x2019;t really matter, it&#x2019;s just a starting point to have the discussion.</p>

<p>The partnership with Tron is starting strong.  There&#x2019;s a 500k Tron soft cap for this round of the promo deal.  We&#x2019;ve already made it 20% of the way and it&#x2019;s only been 30 minutes.  Pretty sure if you don&#x2019;t get in on this in the next hour, maybe a few hours, you&#x2019;re gonna miss it.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I&#x2019;ve had a very simple operating system here on the Steem blockchain, which has been integrated into the mission statement of the Minnow Support Project: Spread the values of Peace, Abundance, and Liberty, grow the Steem ecosystem, and train and retain new members on the platform.  I&#x2019;m now convinced that growth of the ecosystem and retention will be best addressed by adding new (d)apps to the platform.  Not everyone can blog.  We need more forms of entertainment and new services to keep get people using our blockchain and keep them here.  </p>
<p>We need capital coming in, people getting hired, and products/services being sold to raise the value of the Steem token.</p>
<p>To that end I&#x2019;m sharing a vision for a conveyor belt that relies on the Steem Foundation to bring new businesses to Steem:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OZ77q3u.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Ideally a project like The Merger is selected to provide structure, leadership, and aligns financial incentives to to build a pipeline of (d)apps that the community vets, provides some funding in exchange for equity or tokens, and then helps launch them.  I&#x2019;m partial to the Merger since I helped design it and think it&#x2019;s the one that&#x2019;s the most closely aligned with a business migration process, but even if another proposal is chosen their structure can be amended to support bringing businesses to Steem.</p>
<h2 id="What-would-the-steps-be"><a href="#What-would-the-steps-be" class="headerlink" title="What would the steps be?"></a>What would the steps be?</h2><ol>
<li>A marketing committee would build a program to reach out to (a)pps on various chains and those that are just starting and find good potential candidates to migrate to the Steem Blockchain.</li>
<li>A business incubation group would work with them to see if it&#x2019;s a good fit.  They&#x2019;ll check out the product, the userbase, the tech, and the team and provide some public rubrics and scoring.  If it seems like a good plan they can cut a deal using Foundation Funds, delegation, or votes to exchange for equity and tokens offered by the (d)app.</li>
<li>A Product and Development group works out a timeline and helps provide leadership, guidance and technical support to the project to help them transition their tech to work on or integrate with the Steem blockchain.</li>
<li>When the product is ready they work with a community team to help roll out the product.</li>
<li>After the product has achieved some initial success they&#x2019;re routed to the investor team, which helps setup meetings with angel investors to initiate a funding round.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general this process, if successful, can be self funding.  Projects that are financially successful can return funding to the Foundation to then reinvest into new projects.</p>
<h2 id="What-would-be-some-good-community-guidelines-for-proposals-that-receive-investment-from-the-foundation"><a href="#What-would-be-some-good-community-guidelines-for-proposals-that-receive-investment-from-the-foundation" class="headerlink" title="What would be some good community guidelines for proposals that receive investment from the foundation?"></a>What would be some good community guidelines for proposals that receive investment from the foundation?</h2><p>They have a contract.  The contract releases funding over time when milestones are achieved.  They have to stay on the Steem blockchain for at least 1 year after final funding has been completed.  They have to make their security and utility tokens available through the steem blockchain.</p>
<h2 id="What-would-be-a-good-minimum-for-the-incubation-process"><a href="#What-would-be-a-good-minimum-for-the-incubation-process" class="headerlink" title="What would be a good minimum for the incubation process."></a>What would be a good minimum for the incubation process.</h2><p>I don&#x2019;t see this thing funding ideas.  I see them funding projects.  The team would have to include at least 2 people: someone to deal with humans and someone to deal with computers.  They also have to have a product that functions even if it&#x2019;s an extreme version of an alpha product (by having even the smallest working product it allows token creation to be utility tokens and not just Security tokens, which can cut costs down substantially to raise money).</p>

<p><em>Well, there&#x2019;s a lot to break down in this, but it&#x2019;s really great news for Steem Monsters, Steem Engine, and the whole Steem Ecosystem!</em></p>
<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-a-Security-Token-Offerring"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-a-Security-Token-Offerring" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s a Security Token Offerring?"></a>What&#x2019;s a Security Token Offerring?</h2><p>In the last round of token sales that mostly happened on ethereum there were lots of companies that put out tokens and sold them.  They were securities, but the owners didn&#x2019;t bother to register them that way.  They promised equity holders profits and ended up selling illegal securities.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s bad!</p>
<p>So, what Steem Monsters did was incorporate our business in the States.  Matt and I are primary owners of a C-Corp.  We worked with a law firm (the same one we&#x2019;re going to facilitate other STOs to use) to setup our ability to issue a token registered as a restricted security under SEC Reg D.</p>
<h2 id="Steem-Engine"><a href="#Steem-Engine" class="headerlink" title="Steem Engine"></a>Steem Engine</h2><p>So, not only did we make Steem-Engine as a way that we could sell packs on a decentralized exchange, not only are we going to use it for our in-game currency, but we&#x2019;ve been planning to use it for our Security Token since we first discussed it.</p>
<p>We created a token on Steem Engine called SMTT.  This stands for Steem Monsters Team Token.  We capped it at 20M.  We reserved some for the capital raising activities and split some between Matt, me, and reserved more for team members.</p>
<h2 id="100k-in-27hrs"><a href="#100k-in-27hrs" class="headerlink" title="$100k in 27hrs"></a>$100k in 27hrs</h2><p>So, Matt had a lead investor friend of his that wanted to contribute to the fund raising round.  We want to raise larger amounts of money, but it&#x2019;s always tricky to establish value.  So, we targetted a small capital raise of $100,000 as a way to gauge interest and set the price.</p>
<p>We notified our Monster Mavericks (our most active player base and largest card hodlers) through Discord that we&#x2019;re selling equity and 27 hours later less than 10 people committed to funding $100k.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-we-going-to-use-the-money-for"><a href="#What-are-we-going-to-use-the-money-for" class="headerlink" title="What are we going to use the money for?"></a>What are we going to use the money for?</h2><p><del>an exit scam with hookers and blow</del></p>
<p>The primary use of funds will go towards executing on our product road map.  Specifically, we are targetting getting the mobile app developed, and speeding up development by hiring out more part-time help.</p>
<p>We are likely to do further rounds this year and next to hire a few full time developers and make a bigger marketing push, which will include larger tournament prizes for players.</p>
<h2 id="What&#x2019;s-this-mean-for-the-community"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-this-mean-for-the-community" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s this mean for the community?"></a>What&#x2019;s this mean for the community?</h2><p>Honestly, we think this is a game changer.  The vision is to use Steem-engine.com as the next round of the bull run for companies to choose to come here to legally host SEC approved Security Token Offerings.  </p>
<p>We can provide the legal services.<br>We can create and trade the tokens.<br>We&#x2019;ll have other cryptos as tradable tokens on the exchange this or next week.<br>We have our first successful capital raise on the Steem blockchain through Steem Monsters on Steem Engine!</p>
<h2 id="Trail-Blazing"><a href="#Trail-Blazing" class="headerlink" title="Trail Blazing"></a>Trail Blazing</h2><p>Matt and I are both vision committed to supporting the Steem ecosystem to the best of our abilities as is the Steem Monsters and Steem-Engine team.</p>
<p>We built the first game and have helped to attract other games and businesses here.</p>
<p>We built keychain to make logging in to all of these applications and completing transactions easy and safe.  We&#x2019;re REALLLY looking forward to the day Steemit implements it&#x2026;</p>
<p>We built Steem-Engine to allow businesses to form here and aggregate capital here.</p>
<p>We completed the first STO of our own business on our hometown exchange.</p>
<p><strong>If you don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s fucking awesome check yourself for a pulse!</strong></p>
<p>Good times lie ahead for this community and I can&#x2019;t wait to see how this impacts our players, our traders, new businesses and our ecosystem as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="Help-us"><a href="#Help-us" class="headerlink" title="Help us!"></a>Help us!</h2><p>If you think this is good we&#x2019;re looking for help.</p>
<p>Spread the word about Steem Monsters.</p>
<p>If you have a business make a token on Steem-Engine for it (consult an attorney first to stay out of trouble).</p>
<p>If you have some web dev skills please visit the github for Steem-Engine and consider making some utopian vote eligible coding changes to help us expand what it can do.</p>
<p>Buy some Steem Monsters cards to play with or simply to rent.</p>
<p>Spread the word.  <a href="https://steemit.com/steemmonsters/@steemmonsters/steem-monsters-completes-first-ever-security-token-offering-on-steem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Put this story</a> on Twitter and other social media outlets.  Share your impression of what it means.</p>
