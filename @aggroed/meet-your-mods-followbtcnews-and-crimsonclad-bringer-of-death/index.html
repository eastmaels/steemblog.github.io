        <span>@crimsonclad I am an incredibly social creature. Open communication is so important to me. It didn&#x2019;t take me too long to realize that this was a place that I could make very meaningful connections. I fully believe in quiet support and service to others&#x2026;it is, in many ways, a mission in my life both on and offline. I saw MSP as a way to both work on myself while uplifting others who are using Steemit to better themselves. I&#x2019;m also a giant dork and tremendous, irreverent goofball. The match seemed to be just perfect.</span>

        <span class="has-mr-6">6</span>
        <span>@crimsonclad I love the idea of a gift economy; of abundance for all and the ability to pass on income and support to others. It&#x2019;s not all about the money, but at the same time, if we can help people around the world - right around the world and from every country rich or poor, to produce extra income for themselves, while encouraging content creation and self expression, there is literally no downside. I have seen the amazing things some of these people are able to achieve with a dollar a day. It is humbling, awe-inspiring, and I want to be at the forefront of creating more of that. The bonds that are created over goals like this are unshakable. MSP has brought me family I didn&#x2019;t know that I didn&#x2019;t know.</span>

I also try to help the mods, but honestly, the MSP mods are so good, they don&#x2019;t need my help. They do an excellent job of keeping the community cleaned up from spammers and abusers. And they work their butts off to help people.. I couldn&#x2019;t be more proud to be part of such a great community.</span>

        <span>@crimsonclad Moderation for the Minnow Support Project is both leadership and service. I use that term continuously around MSP; I believe part of the great success of PALnet is the growing trend of selfless giving and kindness towards others. To me, moderation here is more than just enforcing rules and a new coloured role to add to the collection. It means inspiring change by example, and doing my best to live the values that I talk to new members about. Change begins from within. I behave now exactly the same as I did wearing my greys and my red&#x2026; I just get a little better each day.</span>

        <span>@followbtcnews lo&#x2026;Well,I don&#x2019;t know where to start.  We have so many going right now.  To start, @crimsonclad and I took care of building and hosting the official MSP website at http://minnowsupportproject.com   Next, we are working on a script for MSP to help out keeping up with the delegations more efficiently and trying to automate everything to make it more easy and better.. next, crimsonclad and I are also building a new website at http://steemistry.com and we have 2 new tools we are about to launch there that we hope will help minnows on the Steemit platform. Next, we have BIG PLANS that we are in the very early stages of that i think will help bring major awareness to Steemit.  And last but not least, we do run a Witness and node for the Steem blockchain and we work very hard to represent Steem in the very best possible way.</span>

        <span>@crimsonclad My original service project was to create the MSP website. Now, I help with maintenance of that as well as some of the other technical or informational tasks. My ongoing service project since then has been to build stronger, healthier discussion and community in the smaller, more specific channels. When new members arrive, I ask them about their location and interests, and then do my best to watch for places that they may find an even better and more meaningful benefit here. I&#x2019;ll pull people into channels and work on introducing members to each other who I think will hit it off or have value to offer each other. Otherwise, I&#x2019;m basically everywhere meddling, all the time. whipcrack</span>

First and foremost, I have always been an advocate of Free speech and no censorship. And steemit provides that. 2nd. its a great way for people to make an extra income and for some it can make a HUGE difference in their life. Its a very euphoric feeling to see someone provide for their family from earnings made by blogging on Steemit.</span>

        <span class="has-mr-6">18</span>
        <span>@crimsonclad This may seem like a strange answer, but I love the way the platform is structured both for anything goes, but also that it contains a control of error (the rep system) to help users decide on what they truly value on the platform. Though we do see some unfair distribution and rep cannot cure all ills, I love the idea that despite having free reign to do whatever you can think up on Steemit, in general, people bond together and seek to do good to counteract the bad. This will change with iterations of Steemit, but the fact remains, we&#x2019;re in the midst of a social experiment with an effective hall pass, and overall, we&#x2019;re still going to classes and studying hard. That tells you a lot about the majority of people here.</span>

        <span>@crimsonclad Steemit has some growing to do. The base idea is here, and it&#x2019;s solid. There are still a number of UI and just general accessibility issues to be smoothed over, but every day witnesses, driven steemians, and observers make good points about features that would make the platform stronger&#x2026; and then go out and MAKE them happen. We build tools, we petition the community, we work together from the top to the bottom and back around to change the course of Steemit. The fact that it isn&#x2019;t set in stone yet is where I fit in: the ability to help mold this platform, even just by being here, and the ability to change the lives of others through charity, service, and in a lot of cases, just by reading and enjoying their content, is an incredible feeling. We&#x2019;ll keep those bits, and continue flowing forward from there, carving a new path as we go.</span>

        <span class="has-mr-6">21</span>
        <span>@crimsonclad The things that I see that MSP can be doing better are much the same as the things I think everyone could be doing better. We are a huge and growing group, and there will always be issues inherent to that - bot abuse, a bit of cliquiness, the eff-you-get-mine attitude that comes with the worry of not being seen on steemit&#x2026; But for each, on both a personal level and a moderator and leadership team level, there are plans. We work each day to weed out people who are taking more than their share or filling the chain with crap, to help build communities that support without shunning, and to teach ourselves and others that mindfulness, gratitude and service to others actually will get you ahead here. I would love to see our interest, cultural, and language based channels continue developing into healthy, discussion based places where anyone who jumps into the pond can find a home and people they can relate to easily to help them find their way. We&#x2019;re on the road there, but not there yet - and in reality, we should NEVER actually make it. The day we &#x201C;finish&#x201D; is the day that we&#x2019;re not helping Steemit innovate and bring value.</span>

The best way fr a minnow to contribute is join the P.A.L. discord and communicate with the members there and grow friendships. Just be yourself and make new friends. If that minnow has some spare SP they can delegate,then do it, if not then don&#x2019;t worry about it. MSP is here to help minnow succeed on steemit.</span>

It&#x2019;s an evolving ecosystem related to Steemit that can literally help change the way you live your everyday life. We have so many great leaders in MSP to help you.  I would also like to see the Steem Power of Minnowsupport grow because it really helps minnows. I would love to see more whales delegate to MSP if they have it to spare. I would love to see @ned and a few others delegate to MSP by helping new Steemians on the platform and rewarding them for good content when they arrive here. It will help user interaction on Steemit and it will also help with onboarding new users. When a new user makes even a small amount of money on their first post, it&#x2019;s very exciting, and they are the hooked for life. Additionally, they will go and tell their family members, friends and everybody they know about Steemit.</span>

<p>When I first met @followbtcnews and @crimsonclad I didn&#x2019;t know what I was going to get.  They came into the Minnow Pond full steem ahead with a vision that they were going to help people.  In the beginning I thought I would have to do a ton to sell folks on the mission, but these two came in pumped, ready to go, and good to work.  It&#x2019;s no wonder that they built a gorgeous webage for the community (minnowsupportproject.org), it&#x2019;s no wonder that they became a witness and having a great run at it, it&#x2019;s no wonder they both took on radio shows, and it&#x2019;s no wonder they keep pumping out new tools and resources for the Steemit Community and the MSP community.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve gotten to know them both over the last few months.  Follow is a shrewd businessman that understand crypto like it&#x2019;s his backyard.  I find him thoughtful, insightful, dedicated and talented.  He&#x2019;s got southern charm and a mission driven heart.  @crimsonclad is well, Crimmy, one of the most passionate and dedicated people I&#x2019;ve met on the platform.  From day one she&#x2019;s been engaged in the community, beloved by the community, and a tireless advocate for this place.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s an absolute pleasure to introduce you to them if you haven&#x2019;t met them.  Also, since not only are they moderators but also witnesses I can tell you that you need to go to www.steemit.com/~witnesses, scroll under the list of names and add &#x201C;followbtcnews&#x201D; into the box.  If you would rather not have to deal with it but would like to support minnows feel free to add aggroed as a proxy and you&#x2019;ll vote the same people I do (basically all the new witnesses coming out of the Minnow Support Group).</p>

Its a very euphoric feeling to see someone provide for their family from earnings made by blogging on Steemit.</h2><h2 id="crimsonclad-This-may-seem-like-a-strange-answer-but-I-love-the-way-the-platform-is-structured-both-for-anything-goes-but-also-that-it-contains-a-control-of-error-the-rep-system-to-help-users-decide-on-what-they-truly-value-on-the-platform-Though-we-do-see-some-unfair-distribution-and-rep-cannot-cure-all-ills-I-love-the-idea-that-despite-having-free-reign-to-do-whatever-you-can-think-up-on-Steemit-in-general-people-bond-together-and-seek-to-do-good-to-counteract-the-bad-This-will-change-with-iterations-of-Steemit-but-the-fact-remains-we&#x2019;re-in-the-midst-of-a-social-experiment-with-an-effective-hall-pass-and-overall-we&#x2019;re-still-going-to-classes-and-studying-hard-That-tells-you-a-lot-about-the-majority-of-people-here"><a href="#crimsonclad-This-may-seem-like-a-strange-answer-but-I-love-the-way-the-platform-is-structured-both-for-anything-goes-but-also-that-it-contains-a-control-of-error-the-rep-system-to-help-users-decide-on-what-they-truly-value-on-the-platform-Though-we-do-see-some-unfair-distribution-and-rep-cannot-cure-all-ills-I-love-the-idea-that-despite-having-free-reign-to-do-whatever-you-can-think-up-on-Steemit-in-general-people-bond-together-and-seek-to-do-good-to-counteract-the-bad-This-will-change-with-iterations-of-Steemit-but-the-fact-remains-we&#x2019;re-in-the-midst-of-a-social-experiment-with-an-effective-hall-pass-and-overall-we&#x2019;re-still-going-to-classes-and-studying-hard-That-tells-you-a-lot-about-the-majority-of-people-here" class="headerlink" title="@crimsonclad This may seem like a strange answer, but I love the way the platform is structured both for anything goes, but also that it contains a control of error (the rep system) to help users decide on what they truly value on the platform.
