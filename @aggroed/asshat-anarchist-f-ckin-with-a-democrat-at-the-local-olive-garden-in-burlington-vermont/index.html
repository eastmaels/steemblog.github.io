&#xA0;Lovely place. &#xA0;I recommend the sweet raspberry tea, unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks all for just $12. &#xA0;</p><br><p><img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fb.fastcompany.net%2Fmultisite_files%2Ffastcompany%2Fimagecache%2Finline-large%2Finline%2F2014%2F03%2F3027212-inline-i-og-stone-logo.jpg&amp;f=1" width="640" height="326"></p><br><p>Now, at this particular Olive Garden I walked in sat at the bar, and was pleasantly surprised to find an attractive blond in her late 20s or early 30s tending bar. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m not out looking for anything, but I&#x2019;d prefer to have an attractive woman on the other side of the table than say a 40 year old kinda fat dude (self referencing here).</p><br><p><img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ffarm3.staticflickr.com%2F2549%2F3974408784_6e51bebdcc_z.jpg%3Fzz%3D1&amp;f=1" width="500" height="333"></p><br><p>Ok, well like I said I was just there to mind my own business and eat a boatload of carbohydrates post 4 hour fat guy climbathon when all of a sudden a Canadian guy and his friend/girlfriend sit down at the table too.</p><br><p><img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.halloweencostumes.com%2Fproducts%2F17954%2F1-1%2Fmens-canadian-mountie-costume.jpg&amp;f=1" width="1750" height="2500"></p><br><p>So, I don&#x2019;t know why, but he decides to start talking to me. &#xA0;&#x201D;Hey, so I was just over the border and I won a bunch of money and now I have to get rid of all these looney and twoneys. &#xA0;I got drunk and lost my wallet, eh. &#xA0;So I had to take a taxi from Canada to the states and then I got held by Canadian Border Patrol for like 8 hours because I was still drunk. &#xA0;They even held my cabbie. &#xA0;He was a foreigner and something about his license was wrong. &#xA0;So they held him for like 2 hours. &#xA0;So I tipped him $100 for that.&#x201D;</p><br><p>&lt;Wow, this is a whole lot of shit I don&#x2019;t care about&gt; &#x201C;That&#x2019;s amazing that you won at a casino. &#xA0;I know math and all those casinos are designed to take your money rather than let you walk away with any of it.&#x201D;</p><br><p>Canadian- Yeah, crazy right. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s crazier than this election.</p><br><p>BOOM! &#xA0;Right there the bar tender went from as bored as I was hearing about this Canadian drunkard&#x2019;s saga and now she&#x2019;s all into it.</p><br><p><img src="https://debsknig.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/img_7733.jpg" width="1024" height="678">&#xA0;(sorry she&#x2019;s a brunette in this, but it&#x2019;s that &#x201C;you caught my attention look&#x201D; I liked)</p><br><p>So, he asks &#x201C;who do you think is going to win.&#x201D;</p><br><p>Canada&#x2019;s girlfriend says &#x201C;Hillary.&#x201D; &#xA0;the bartender says &#x201C;Hillary&#x201D; &#xA0;I say &#x201C;Trump.&#x201D;</p><br><p>The bartender looks <del>like I just grabbed her by the pussy</del> aghast.</p><br><p><img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.achievingskills.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F11%2Ffollow1.jpg&amp;f=1" width="1785" height="2073"></p><br><p>&#x201C;How can you think Trump is going to win?

&#xA0;Democrats want peace.&#x201D;</p><br><p>Me- &#x201C;Yes, average Democrats seem to want peace, but that&#x2019;s not what party leadership allows. &#xA0;Trump talks about making friends with Russia and working cooperatively to destroy ISIS. &#xA0;Hillary&#x2019;s plan is to create a no-fly zone in Syria that would basically spark an even larger proxy war with Russia. &#xA0;She&#x2019;s the star candidate of the military industrial complex. &#xA0;If you want peace you can&#x2019;t vote for her.&#x201D;</p><br><p>This had an effect on her. &#xA0;She couldn&#x2019;t believe I could say anything like that. &#xA0;She stuck with violence but changed subjects. &#xA0;&#x201D;If you want to talk about violence you have to talk about how Trump sexually assaults women.&#x201D;</p><br><p>Me-&#x201C; &#xA0;yes he does. &#xA0;&#xA0;He&#x2019;s busted in a lawsuit involving him and Jefferey Epstein a known class 3 pedophile for raping a 13 year old girl while hitting her. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s pretty terrible, but you know who else is a rapist? &#xA0;Bill Clinton. &#xA0;he&#x2019;s worse. &#xA0;He&#x2019;s been on the same orgy island and lolita express Trump was on with Epstein, but dozens of times more frequently&#x201D;</p><br><p><img src="https://dallasnews.imgix.net/1476116047-debate21476074829.5.jpg?auto=format,enhance&amp;crop=faces,entropy&amp;fit=crop&amp;q=40&amp;or=0&amp;w=1100&amp;h=582" width="1100" height="582"></p><br><p>(Here&#x2019;s Bill at the debate as he&#x2019;s staring at the women Trump flew in who have all accused him of rape.)</p><br><p><img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fsoowhatnow.files.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F06%2Fhair-on-fire.jpg&amp;f=1" width="800" height="600"></p><br><p>Now she&#x2019;s having an extremely hard time. &#xA0;&#x201D;There is absolutely no proof of that. &#xA0;How can you say that about him. &#xA0;He was a great president. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t care about Monica Lewinsky sucking him off. &#xA0;He did his job!&#x201D;</p><br><p>Me- I&#x2019;m not talking about Monica. &#xA0;that seemed to be consentual (actually it was probably a Honeytrap that dumb ass Bill fell for, but I&#x2019;m trying not to go truther on her). &#xA0;Didn&#x2019;t you watch the first debate. &#xA0;Trump flew four women into the debate all of whom accused Bill of rape and they even held a press conference about it.</p><br><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s not a rapist. &#xA0;Show me a conviction.&#x201D;</p><br><p>Me- &#x201C;There are two forms of law in this country. &#xA0;Law for the rich oligarchs that run this place and laws for the rest of us. &#xA0;Bill has a lot of money and power. &#xA0;Instead of getting convicted he paid them off. &#xA0;Just google Paula Jones. &#xA0;He had to give her $850k. &#xA0;Rich guys like him won&#x2019;t go to jail. &#xA0;He paid them off not to press charges. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s all settled out of court.&#x201D;</p><br><p>Her- &#x201C;Our justice system isn&#x2019;t like that! &#xA0;It&#x2019;s fair and equitable!&#x201D;</p><br><p>Me- Laughing at her &#x201C;you&#x2019;re kidding me right? &#xA0;Just check out the number of black people in prison. &#xA0;They represent 11% of the population and over 25% of the prison population.&#x201D;</p><br><p>Her- &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s fair. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t see race. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t believe that.&#x201D;</p><br><p>Me- &#x201C;Great. &#xA0;That&#x2019;s commendable, but that&#x2019;s the reality. &#xA0;You either have to believe that black people are more likely to commit crimes and that&#x2019;s why there are more of them in prison by percentage of the population or you have to admit that this justice system has systemic issues of inequality.&#x201D;</p><br><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/US_incarceration_timeline-clean.svg/2000px-US_incarceration_timeline-clean.svg.png" width="2000" height="1339"></p><br><p><img src="http://www.childtrends.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/89_fig2.jpg"></p><br><p><img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fblueboat.blogs.uua.org%2Ffiles%2F2014%2F05%2Fmeninprisonorjail.jpg&amp;f=1" width="499" height="341"></p><br><p>Bar Tender- &#x201C;That doesn&#x2019;t make any sense. &#xA0;Like take for example serial killers. &#xA0;I bet you can&#x2019;t name any black serial killers.&#x201D;</p><br><p>Me- &#x201C;That&#x2019;s because the media labels people differenlyt based on their race. &#xA0;White people that kill others are lone gunmen or serial killers. &#xA0;Blacks that kill people are gang bangers. &#xA0;Muslims that kill people are labelled terrorist. &#xA0;That&#x2019;s not about how people kill each other it&#x2019;s simply that the media is racist and assigns a different title for your actions based on your race.&#x201D;</p><br><p>Canadian- &#x201C;He has a point.&#x201D;</p><br><p>Bar Tender- &#x201C;Look, I don&#x2019;t see race. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s real.&#x201D;</p><br><p>Canadian- &#x201C;He has a point.&#x201D;</p><br><p>Bar Tender- &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t like that. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t see race. &#xA0;That&#x2019;s not how the system is supposed to work.&#x201D;</p><br><p>Me- &#x201C;That&#x2019;s noble. &#xA0;I agree. &#xA0;That&#x2019;s why I can&#x2019;t vote for Democrats. &#xA0;They will perpetuate the systems that benefit the wealthy at the cost of the poor. &#xA0;You heard of NAFTA? &#xA0;CAFTA? TPP? &#xA0;Those are all trade deals that took good American manufacturing jobs and shipped them to third world countries with artificially deflated currencies so that giant corporations could cut their labor costs and make a killing selling third world made crap to Americans.&#x201D;</p><br><p><img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.novemberfire.com%2Fsticker%2Flarge%2Fst039pop.gif&amp;f=1" width="547" height="423"></p><br><p>Bartender- &#x201C;Trump is going to be worse. &#xA0;He made all of his money not paying his employees.&#x201D;</p><br><p>Me- &#x201C;That&#x2019;s entirely possible. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m not a fan of him either. &#xA0;My answer to this is that if this is what the system produces it&#x2019;s time to withdraw all consent from this system. &#xA0;I can&#x2019;t vote for either of them. &#xA0;Besides Hillary is likely to figure out a way to rig this election like she did the primaries so all votes cease to matter anyway(s).&#x201D;</p><br><p>This is approximately the time that&#x2019;s she had enough of me. &#xA0;She says something to the effect of &#x201C;well, I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s right&#x201D; and brings my check in a huff.</p><br><p>&#x2014;</p><br><p>I know I didn&#x2019;t win the argument. &#xA0;You can&#x2019;t really win against people whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stockholm Syndrome</a> is that strong. &#xA0;All I did was put a little bit of doubt into her head. &#xA0;After 5 years of sales I know that people almost never make life altering decisions just because I&#x2019;ve presented them with a different reality picture than what they&#x2019;ve held for a long time. &#xA0;It takes time for stuff like that to settle in. &#xA0;The mind rejects it at first. &#xA0;Honestly, I can&#x2019;t believe that we went on that long and I had that many opportunities to tell a different story about her candidate. &#xA0;I suppose living in Burlington Vermont she&#x2019;s surrounded mostly by liberal minded suckers like her (and formerly me as well) and so this may have been the first time she&#x2019;s been challenged like this.</p><br><p>I get why people want to vote as Democrats. &#xA0;They want more equality. &#xA0;They want peace. &#xA0;They want a safer community. &#xA0;I guess they just don&#x2019;t look very closely at the track record or somehow are able to block out all the clusterfucks they have caused. &#xA0;I can see how the things that Hillary says appeals to those people on the surface. &#xA0;What I continue to be shocked by is the fact that Hillary supporters blanketedly refuse to look past MSNBS for their news on her. &#xA0;They only see one side and get scared by other opinions that might contradict theirs.</p><br><p>&#x2014;&#x2014;</p><br><p>Here&#x2019;s my real thought. &#xA0;I woke up hard in 2012. &#xA0;I read a graphic that I liked of &#x201C;all you have to do is wake up two more people.&#x201D; &#xA0;See folks that woke up won&#x2019;t go back to sleep, so if everyone wakes up 2 you don&#x2019;t need many cycles before the whole country is awake. &#xA0;That&#x2019;s the power of exponential math. &#xA0;&#xA0;I believe I&#x2019;ve woken up hundreds of people. &#xA0;So, I&#x2019;m well above my quota, so I&#x2019;m not going to lose sleep over whether she decides to wake up or not. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s all good. &#xA0;People will wake up at their own pace, but I do think I did her a favor by at least exposing her to a set of reasons and thoughts that start the internal confusion about how she can like her candidate on values that the candidate may not actually stand for.&#xA0;</p><br><p>I&#x2019;d love to run around drop kicking liberals and conservatives all day.</p><br><p><img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmemecrunch.com%2Fmeme%2F29PJW%2Fthis-is-sparta%2Fimage.png&amp;f=1" width="500" height="333"></p><br><p>Sadly, there isn&#x2019;t enough time for that. &#xA0;Jobs to do. &#xA0;Articles to write. &#xA0;And honestly, it&#x2019;s just not nice. &#xA0;People really ought to have a more gentle wake up than getting figuratively slapped around by me for 30 minutes on how all that they believe is foolish. &#xA0;That said, tonight was a no fucks given, no holds barred, asshattery kinda night, and it was fun tweaking out a &#x2018;I&#x2019;m with her&#x201D; foot soldier since it&#x2019;s too risky to go after my wife or my best friend. &#xA0;&lt;sad panda&gt;</p><br><p><img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.kym-cdn.com%2Fphotos%2Fimages%2Foriginal%2F000%2F101%2F813%2FI-participated-in-the-afforementioned-action-to-accomplish-the-lulz.jpg&amp;f=1" width="274" height="360"></p><br><p><br></p><br>
