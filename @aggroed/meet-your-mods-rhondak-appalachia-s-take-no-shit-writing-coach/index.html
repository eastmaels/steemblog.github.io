            <p>Couple of quick things first.  I&#x2019;m running my radio show tomorrow from 9pm to 11pm EST.  I&#x2019;m giving away 25 SBD and 1k SP in delegation.  It&#x2019;s on mspwaves.com.  Come check us out.</p>
<p>OK, so, next up on the Meet your Mods series is Rhonda.  She&#x2019;s in the footehills in Appalachia.  She&#x2019;s tough as nails and spends her time in the Minnow Pond running the Fiction Workshop.  It&#x2019;s been hugely popular and helped numerous people win Curie Votes and is a part of the Minnow Support Project that helps uphold the educational mission of this place to improve the quality of content.  Maybe one day we&#x2019;ll get more variety in the trending pages, and when we finally do you can bet your ass some of the folks in there will have benefitted from some tough critiques from @rhondak.</p>
<p>Back in her physical world she&#x2019;s fighting corruption and animal abuse with her animal shelter project.  The liquid rewards of this post will help her kick some maleficent official ass and take care of some abused animals.</p>

<p>Word of caution.  The Fiction Workshop isn&#x2019;t  a place to fuck around. Don&#x2019;t post and run.  And don&#x2019;t act like a brat when they tear your word baby to shreds.  That&#x2019;s what they do and that&#x2019;s exactly how you get real help.  But there isn&#x2019;t hand holding in this group.  So, drop your shields and keep your chin up.  You can thank them later when it pays off and you&#x2019;re doing better.</p>
