        <span>@sammosk-  What being a moderator means to me? A hundred thousand characters a day or more haha. Means I have to take a breath and be better (thanks crimmy) sometimes. It is a way for me to balance myself more effectively and to reach out and empower others along the way with a gentle nudge or some words. It means I can take someones hand who is lost and journey with to a better place.  I actually love it.</span>

        <span class="has-mr-6">7</span>
        <span>@sammosk- @msp-creativebot, it is a project designed to support and uplift creative and original content. Simple guidelines to follow 1-3 posts max per day, a delegation of anywhere from 10-100sp to anywhere you&#x2019;d like. And original content.  It acts as a force multiplier, a way to encourage higher quality posting, a (once commited) hands-free communal effort and I believe it is one of the most awesome things I have done with/for MSP and PAL. I love that lil bot and each and everyone of its supporting members. &lt;3</span>

        <span>@sammosk-  I don&#x2019;t sleep, I rarely eat, attached to the tea cup by a siphon. I think this answers your question. The support never ends, it is a blessing and a curse and part of the reason why I asked for more mods and some changes to further distribute the load to avoid burnout. I know I should be fine, but worry about others sometimes.</span>

        <span>@sammosk- Because it is one way to give back to the community, build a network and support the palnet discord and msp. We need to distribute tasks further to people who are interested in actually performing them and so I encourage anyone who is active in a particular niche or channel to put hand up and consider showing some interest. Plus it is part of the ladder you should climb if you wish to become a fully fledged mod.</span>

        <span>@sammosk- The ability to perform one to many communications or one to one communications stored permanently on the chain without fear of censorship. The ability to reach out, touch, and be touched is my primary source of amaze regarding steemit, the technology is okay, the financial reward, also cool but not the be all to end all.  I have some barriers in my life that I am trying to break through and forcing myself onto a public blockchain backed platform like Steemit I believe will help me through them.</span>

<p>We&#x2019;ve met Shane (@swelker101) and we&#x2019;ve met @gmuxx.  Let&#x2019;s go say hello to @sammosk!  The creator and key holder for msp-creativebot.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;ve hung out in the Minnow Support Project for a while you might see that people Level Up every so often.  We have a variety of pre-programmed Discord Bots in there.  Tatsumaki is one of them.  Tat keeps a log of how much people are talking in the channels in PALnet for us.  Every 20 sec or so it will award some points if you&#x2019;re typing in a channel.  Sammo is clearly in the lead on the top typer charts.  So, if there is anyone you&#x2019;ve met in PAL it&#x2019;s probably him!</p>
