        <span>@juliakponsford Everything about Steemit excites me! The potential for people to earn money from their skills is a game changer, also it gives us the ability to meet people from all over the world.

<p>OK, well, turns out I&#x2019;m a Leet Witness!!!!  Not really in the technical sense of that, but in the sense that I passed 1337 Witness votes!  So, that&#x2019;s awesome.  I&#x2019;m highly appreciative of the support you&#x2019;re giving me.  I&#x2019;m turning that back to support the minnows in the pond grow their accounts.</p>
<p>I asked them each the same set of questions as the other mods.</p>
