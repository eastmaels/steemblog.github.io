I’ve enjoyed reading content from a lot of different users and have always recommend that friends and family check the platform out. Unfortunately their next question was always what is your steem page? I’d then have to respond that while I think the platform is amazing I hadn’t actually posted anything. That changes today! First off I’m married to a lovely lady named Kati. She really is my rock and supports me through all my adventures. She even does an alright job of keeping me within the lines when I start to get a little too creative. I couldn’t be who I am without her. As much as she means to me though I doubt that will be why you would keep up with my posts. For that I would imagine we will probably need to have some shared interests. While I enjoy lots of different sports and political topics my main interest has been bitcoin and digital currencies for some time. That will probably be the majority of what I actually end up posting about on here. In fact I imagine it will be very similar to my Google+ profile where I’ve been sharing bitcoin news and updates for since early 2015. Speaking of having a wife that supports me. I actually quit my regular day job a couple months back to pursue growing the crypto space in my home state of Kentucky. To do this I actually operate 2 different Bitcoin ATMs as well as offer educational services for anyone that wants to learn more. If you are in the area you should stop by and check one of them out! Anyways give me a follow if you think you’ll find some interesting content. I can’t wait to get started actually sharing some! This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Hi Steemit!

They finished the first week of their soft-launch where they have completed more than 1 million dollars in swaps and options trades. Not bad for a company that was trying to keep a low-key launch! LedgerX made headlines back in July when they were the first Swap Execution Facility (SEF) and Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) company focused on bitcoin to be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This should allow lots of new money to enter the markets that was sitting on the sidelines before!

Now anyone who held their own private keys for bitcoin will have the same amount of Bitcoin Gold available to them. Bitcoin Gold, also known as BGold, is a fork from the traditional bitcoin that implements a new proof of work algorithm called Equihash that aims to make mining more decentralized. Equihash has yet to have ASIC chips developed for it so it is still best mined by using GPUs. Source: https://btcgpu.org/ MIT Issues First Digital Diplomas MIT has been an innovator in the bitcoin space for some time now and they’ve just added another notch to the proverbial belt. As a part of a pilot program, they allowed 111 graduates to receive their diplomas on their phones courtesy of a blockchain network. This not only allows them to share the diploma with potential employers it also creates an immutable proof of their education that can last forever. MIT originally made headlines in the space back in 2014 when they gave each undergraduate the ability to receive $100 of free bitcoin. At the time they released the program, each student could receive about .29 BTC that would be worth about $1,069 today. While not enough to cover their tuition itself, if they hold on to it maybe it can help pay for their kids education someday… Source: http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-debuts-secure-digital-diploma-using-bitcoin-blockchain-technology-1017 Valuable Lessons That’s it! As a side note I’ve learned a very valuable lesson on using Steemit that I should have already known. Despite being my first post in this series it’s actually the second time I’ve written this article. That’s because the first time after hitting post my connection must have timed out and the post wasn’t recoverable.

Today we look at Overstock’s tZERO launching an ICO next month, an analyst makes call on CNBC that Bitcoin’s marketcap will surpass Apple and The Bitgive Foundation has launched Givetrack. Overstock’s tZERO is Launching an Initial Coin Offering Next Month Patrick Byrne, the outspoken leader of Overstock, announced at the Money 20/20 conference that a subsidy of his company that goes by T0 will be launching an ICO next month. Byrne went on to say that this sale would run from November 15 until December 31. He also announced the sale will be administered as a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) project. This allows accredited investors to participate bringing the potential for a very large funding potential. Filecoin went through the same process and raised $200 million earlier this year. Byrne has stated, “From what I am hearing, we are going to raise a fortune – $200-$500m easily.” Last month T0 made an announcement they would be working with the Argon Group and RenGen in order to launch an Alternative Trading System. It appears that the T0 coin will be used as a mechanism similar to Ethereum’s gas.

CNBC recently had Ronnie Moas, the founder and director of Standpoint Research, on Capital Connection. There he stated that “People need to start taking this seriously because today bitcoin caught up with Goldman Sachs, Within five years, it’s going to catch Apple which has (a more than) $800 billion market cap.” Speaking like someone who actually understands Bitcoin, Moas went on to say that “You have a supply-demand equation here that is mind-boggling to me.” He continued to say that “If 1% of that $200 trillion (combined global markets of gold, stocks, bonds and cash) finds its way into cryptocurrency in the next 10 years, you will be looking at a $2 trillion valuation, 12x what it is today, and that will drive bitcoin price above $50,000.” This isn’t the first time that Moas has been bullish on bitcoin. He correctly called that Bitcoin would rise to $5,000 within a few months back in June.

As you may have read in my introduction post, I operate a couple Bitcoin ATMs in my area. I started doing the machines to help others in my region have an easier access to jump into Bitcoin. That being said I think people need a direct way into another currency, Steem! That’s why I’m hoping this post finds someone with an advanced knowledge of integrating Steem into new products. The machines I, and at least 438 locations, use are made by General Bytes. What’s great about GB is that they’ve put lots of work into expanding the functionality of their platform. They now have support for a wide range of crypto, like LTC, Ethereum, Dash and others but Steem is surprisingly still missing. They also offer new updates for both security and functionality at least once a month so I think they will be around for some time! Another part of their platform that I find interesting is that they’ve released an open source extension for developers to integrate other cryptocurrencies onto their platform. This is where you hopefully come in! If you would be interested in helping bring this functionality to the 440 machines that are already listed on CoinATMRadar plus a potential new set of owners then we would love to have your help! I definitely appreciate you taking the time to read this post and hope that if you have the skills to make this integration happen that you take a look and see if it would be possible. I personally feel that adding a new way for new users to be on-boarded, with such an ease of use, could do wonders for Steem in the long run. If you’re like me and don’t have the skill set to make this happen, please share this article with anyone that may or if someone is already on the ball please share their project in the comments below.

I found out that we’re moving down the value names for a new Bitcoin fork, possibly seeing one of the largest retailers in the world accept Bitcoin for payment and personally been disappointed in Coinbase’s stance. I hope you enjoy and please leave a comment below! Ready for Another Fork?: Bitcoin Silver Is On The Way! Bitcointalk user Simonsolo dropped a new potential fork to the world yesterday. Yes you heard that right another new fork of bitcoin. The similarities to Bitcoin Gold don’t end with just the naming either. The Bitcointalk post lists 4 main bullet points such as decentralization, fair distribution, replay protection and transparency all the same as what are listed on Bitcoin Gold’s website. It goes even deeper, they will also share the same proof of work algorithm Equihash which is what’s credited for the decentralization of Satoshi’s vision of “one CPU on vote.” Who’s with me to do Bitcoin Bronze in January? Source: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2311582.0 Potential Amazon Bitcoin Announcement? Back in September, The James Altucher Report stated that Amazon could make an announcement as early as their next earnings call that the retail giant would begin accepting Bitcoin. This was then picked up by Squawker.org who went on to note that Amazon Web Services had begun working with Digital Currency Group back in 2016. With the rumor now swirling, it led to an article from Die Welt, a German national newspaper, that stated rumors were running in Silicon Valley that Amazon would soon accept the digital currency. This was further echoed by Cointelegraph today with another article on the topic. You can already shop on Amazon using Bitcoin with Purse.io but having another company the size of Amazon supporting it natively would definitely give a strong use case for the revolutionary ledger. While on that thought, what an excellent acquisition Purse would actually make for the retail giant. Not only would you be picking up a company that is already saving your customers 20% over you own prices, you’d also get some of the brightest minds in the industry. Source: https://squawker.org/technology/breaking-amazon-will-accept-bitcoin-by-october/ Coinbase Reverses Course on Bitcoin Naming After issuing a blog entry on Monday stating that they would operate by naming the traditional bitcoin chain Bitcoin and refer to the forked chain as Bitcoin2x. Yesterday they then released a clarification stating they would be calling “the chain with the most accumulated difficulty Bitcoin.” This immediately brought back the nervousness of the fork for many while others questioned the logic. If Coinbase was going to name the chain with the most most difficulty wouldn’t that mean that Bitcoin Cash should have shared the label of Bitcoin anytime it had surpassed traditional Bitcoin’s difficulty. Will we see a new clarification issued reversing the reversal? I have to hope so, for Coinbase’s sake.

This rebrand won’t be just in a name though. While highlighting Airbitz’s unique client side security they will now expand the features of the platform to include additional currencies plus a way to seamlessly convert between them and also new tech that will enable lower payment fees. The new currencies that will be supported out of the gate are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Augur REP, Wings, and Matryx tokens. These won’t be the only coins to gain support either. Since the new wallet is written from the ground up Airbitz built a new modular architecture that will allow it to be able to secure and transact with any blockchain or token through a simple plugin. This will enable developers to contribute their support and see their currency available on the Edge platform. Finally some new features that will be included is the ability to natively use Shapeshift.io to convert tokens from one chain to the other. This will save users the step of sending the coins to Shapeshift thus reducing the risk of error for conversions. They have also enabled SegWit support for both Bitcoin and Litecoin which should help wallet users by giving them a smaller tx and thus lower fees.

This isn’t the end for one of the best funded bitcoin companies that brought us the The Bitcoin Computer though, in fact, it is just the beginning. Now they will be known as Earn.com which better identifies their new objectives of helping users get bitcoin for their time. This isn’t without warning though. 21 took a strong pivot over that past year to move away from their prior hardware goals towards a new software future. After launching a platform that allowed users to create a public profile and get paid to respond to messages, they expanded over the past few months to create a Gmail bounce solution that expands on getting paid for your attention. Now it’s very clear they plan to move forward with this pivot. This is echoed by the fact their old website will forward your views directly to their newly redesigned website and they have changed all of their legacy social networks to earndotcom. “The idea behind Earn.com is that we’ve built a positive-sum social network, where every notification is an opportunity to earn money. This is quite different from existing social networks, where notifications are often distracting or even downright negative.” The new network will be built upon a new ERC20 token that they will begin giving out for user’s time. In fact that will be the only way for regular users to gain access to the token directly from Earn. (That being said since they are ERC20 tokens you will be able to exchange them using other exchanges easily.) They will begin by creating 21 million tokens and begin giving them out. As the userbase of Earn.com doubles then the token issuance will be cut in half. I have to say that I’ve been a 21.co user from their Bitcoin Computer days and even followed them through to have all my personal gmail messages filtered and bounced using their service. As with a lot of users I will miss the old name but can definitely see the value to their new name. Don’t fret if you were also a prior user. All of your usernames and messages will simply be moved the new domain. This reminds me, if you ever need to reach out, feel free to send me a message at https://earn.com/patrickulrich/.

Blockstream’s blog goes on to describe, “As an alternative to existing cryptocurrency languages, the sequent-calculus-based Simplicity language offers a few major improvements, the first of which is extended capabilities. One of the problems with Bitcoin Script, Bitcoin’s own programming language, is that a number of opcodes were disabled in Bitcoin’s earliest days. For example, you can add numbers in Bitcoin Script, but you can’t multiply them. O’Connor wanted something more flexible.” Dr. O’Connor goes on to say, “Simplicity is a low-level, typed, functional, native MAST language where programs are built from basic combinators. Like Bitcoin Script, Simplicity is designed to operate at the consensus layer. While one can write Simplicity by hand, it is expected to be the target of one, or multiple, front-end languages.” While this will help develop new functionality to Bitcoin, like smart contracts, we’re still a bit off. Currently the project is still a part of the Blockstream R&amp;D division where Dr. O’Connor and crew will work to create an SDK. From there they hope to merge it into the Elements project so other developers will be able to experiment on sidechains. There’s still a long way to go but this will enable many new features that weren’t possible in bitcoin before. To get a deeper understanding of Simplicity check out their white paper.

While I’m sure this will be resolved in the future, right now I don’t like how it’s set up. I don’t like this setup so much that I even went as far as to create a 2nd account to just post content using apps like Zappl and Steepshot. Then I started to write a post to introduce the account and realized I would want to always be able to scroll back through what I’ve shared on these networks and if I ever merge things back together then I doubt I’ll be able to ever combine this content. I did this second account so I wouldn’t bother any of my followers if they didn’t want to see a lot of short content posts like Zappl or single image shares like what comes from Steepshot. Then it dawned on me that others may not even be bothered by this as much as I am.

In @ned’s appearance, it was pointed out the hilarity that anyone in crypto is using traditional social media for making announcements and not doing so on Steem. Since then I’ve dug much deeper in having embraced the full ecosystem of Steem applications. From getting started on my first Steemit post to becoming more active on @steepshot and a huge fan of watching content on @dtube. I can’t wait to see what all 2018 brings in that regard. With all of that said, I have to give my biggest thanks to each of you. Social media is about the community you build around yourself. Had I joined and no one was interested in my content, or decided to not take the time to communicate with me, I would have left. That’s why I want to spend much more time in #introduceyourself this year. I think having those early connections is so important for people to find value here. So thank you!

You can share photos with Steepshot (just like Instagram), add videos for others to watch using DTube (just like YouTube) or even go live with a broadcast like you would on Periscope or Facebook Live. Last night, while I was testing out my PS4 stream on my new secondary account, @markop mentioned having some issues with setting up a stream. I had promised I’d put a guide from how I put mine together and here it is! To get started we will have to download the Open Broadcaster Software known as OBS. It is what controls your feed for being live. So let’s get started… 1.) Downlaod OBS You can find the software for OBS at https://obsproject.com 2.) Install OBS 3.) Visit DLive.com and sign in using SteemConnect 4.) Hit ‘Go Live’ in upper right corner 5.) Start by clicking ‘Upload thumbnail’ This will create the header image for your Steemit post as well as what shows up on the thumbnail for DLive. 6.) Give you video a title and description based on what your stream will be about If applicable enable the ‘Enable age restriction’ if your video is going to have any adult content 7.) Use the drop down to add a category for your video 8.) Add any tags you’d like to join in for the video 9.) Apply your video’s primary language 10.) Open OBS 11.) Hit ‘Settings’ in the lower right hand corner 12.) Click the ‘Stream’ tab on the pop up menu 13.) Change the top dropdown for Stream Type to ‘Custom Streaming Server’ 14.) Pulling from the lower right hand corner of the DLive page, that we were inputting your stream title, description, tags, etc on, insert the URL, Stream Key, Select ‘Use Authentication’, username and password into OBS. 15.) Hit ‘Apply’ in lower right hand corner of OBS and then ‘Ok’ 16.) Edit how you like your Steemit post to appear and then hit ‘Post’. (Note: It will prepopulate using your title and description given in step 6.) 17.) Hit ‘Start’ to begin the connection. After hitting start you will have to wait for a few moments. It will then pop up a reminder to start OBS. 18.) Go back into OBS to make sure your feed is set up the way you want. To add a video feed hit the ‘+’ under sources and chose what you want to broadcast.– Display Capture - shows a feed of what your display shows– Image - Displays a still image file– Video Capture Device - This would be where you would add you webcam or other video feed 19.)

Enjoy your broadcast and try to monitor the comments. It’s useful if you can keep the feed up so you can interact with your followers. After your broadcast is over you can hit ‘End’ on the DLive page. From there it will inform you that a broadcast will be available in your profile within the next 24 hours. From there you can save your video to retain or to upload back onto DLive or DTube. There’s no longer a reason to give your broadcasts to Facebook again!

This means you can allow them to have your posting key and earn a reward for when they vote as you. Learn more by reading below or getting started at https://smartsteem.com?r=patrickulrich If you would like to buy a vote from @smartsteem then all you have to do is send at least 0.50 SBD to @smartsteem with a link to your post in the memo field. From there you will be entered into the next smartsteem voting pool and receive an upvote proportional to your stake in the voting pool. It’s an excellent way to help build up your reputation and Steem rewards. If you would prefer to sell your vote for @smartsteem to use then all you have to do is go to @smartsteem’s website and then hit ‘Sell Upvotes’ along the top of the screen. From there you will set your preferred power threshold and how often you’d like automatic payouts then save and get started. From here the bot will vote on your behalf and you will earn rewards based on what that vote was sold for. It’s a great way to earn a few extra SBDs along the way. Additionally you can also delegate your SP to @smartsteem but then you don’t have it to vote along the way. If you would prefer to still go that route then you can simply hit ‘Delegate Steempower’ at the top of their website. Then hit the blue delegate button and determine how much you’d like to delegate to @smartsteem. From there you will earn a reward based on how much you’ve delegated to them.

As an everyday user it is a great way to get rewarded for sharing your thoughts and opinions on some surveys they will send out. As a business, it’s an excellent way to get replies from users without randomly sending tons of random emails out. How it works!After signing up Earn will allow you to join different lists based on your interests or skills. Some of these lists may be a bit exclusive, like CEOs or media personalities, but there’s even lists for basic bitcoin users. After you sign up for a list and get approved you just wait. Once a business is ready to start sending messages out, it will order from a list and give a payment they are willing to pay for a response. This can vary but a lot of the messages I’ve seen have been around the $1 mark. At this point everyone on this list will receive a message stating they have a message worth $1 waiting for their response. After they sign in an complete they questionaire their account is then credited with $1 worth of BTC. You can then withdraw this BTC to your own personal wallet or you can forward it to a charity. I’ve done this multiple times and it is extremely easy! That’s not all!Earn also acts as an excellent email bouncer. What this means is that you can have spam email sent a message requiring them to pay to connect with you. This works by syncing your Gmail account up that whenever someone sends you an email, that is outside of your list, then they will get an email back saying they can contact you using Earn. From there, if they pay to send the message, you will get the reward once you respond. For me this is an excellent resource to keep spammers out of my inbox. When a spammer does want to connect I am now rewarded for giving them a piece of my attention. It suddenly makes checking their messages so much easier! Getting StartedGo to earn.com/patrickulrich/referral/?a=v4nfo4z647k1psw1 and sign up. It’s that easy. If you do have any questions then feel free to leave a comment below and I will be more than happy to help out however I can! [Advertisement] - Earn SBD for your voting power using smartsteem! Converting Earnings to SteemIf you’re like me then you may want to convert this new BTC into some more Steem for use on the Steemit network. Well that is extremely simple using Blocktrades.us and Earn.com. The first thing you’ll need to do is open Blocktrades.us and adjust that you want to deposit BTC and that you want to receive Steem. Once you’ve done that click “Get a new Deposit Address.” From here you’ll want to copy the BTC address that Blocktrades presents. Now go back and log into Earn.com and click on your balance in the upper right hand corner of the main signed in page. From here you’ll want to paste your Blocktrades.us deposit address in the Earn withdrawal address. You can then adjust how much you’d like to withdraw but once ready simply hit Next. A confirmation will pop up asking you to confirm your withdraw address and amount. After ensuring it matches what you’d like to send hit Next. On the next pop up it’s going to again confirm your Blocktrades.us address is correct and then hit bot checkboxes that you realize withdraw times can take up to a day and that Earn cannot recover lost funds. Finally hit next again. Your BTC from Earn is now on it’s way to Blocktrades to be converted to Steem for you. This can take a while and depends on how fast miner’s pickup the transaction and confirm it. If you kept your Blocktrades.us tab open it may still show that nothing is pending or completed for a bit even after you sent the funds from Earn. This is fairly normal but should eventually move on to a pending or confirmed state. So I hope this helps each of you earn a few more dollars each month using Earn.com and hopefully you’ll be able to turn that into more SP to begin earning even more rewards using your smartsteem account.

You can begin buying different fighters, using Ether, to build your collection of CryptoFighters not at all unlike the traditional series of games. Each CryptoFighter has different features that make him or her unique. These features can range from their fight metrics (Str, Vit, Dex, Luk) but also in their unique genes that are individual to each fighter. For example my Orc General (#1757) is a 15, 10, 4, 4 on his fight metrics but also has the unique traits of Orc, Rebel, Classy Outfit, Protective Footwear and Bone Weapon. These different traits make him unlike any of the other CryptoFighters. Additionally the site now has a section called ‘The Arena’ which is a place where players can team up 5 of their CryptoFighters to enter the Arena and fight another player’s group of CryptoFighters . Each time a fighter battles, it gets stronger, and the winner of the battle wins a new CryptoFighter. This new CryptoFighter is distributed based on the fighter that you had lead your team. My CryptoFighter Experience@clove71 was doing a DLive broadcast a month or so back when she received her first CryptoFighter as the result of a Twitter contest. At the time I had just heard about some other crypto-trading games but nothing really seemed to be for me (nothing against Kitties!) That was until I found out that these CryptoFighters are supposed to fight in an arena to determine how new cards are released. That sounded game changing to me! Unfortunately at the time this functionality wasn’t built into the platform yet so I didn’t want to jump in. Far too many crypto projects sound cool but as soon as the founders get the money they disappear. This certainly didn’t happen as a month later they’ve rolled out The Arena. I still hadn’t heard about this until I was catching another of @clove71’s streams the other night and she was doing her first battle in the Arena. I was immediately sold but my problem was that I didn’t have any money to buy any CryptoFighters as I had recently moved everything into Steem to prepare to launch @dliveupvote. That was until a lucky accident happened and I found $160 on an old Bitshares account. I quickly traded $60 to Ether and sent it over to my MetaMask. Now that I’m in to play I’m going to keep track of my CryptoFighter holdings on a regular Steem post. This will not only allow me to track what I have in each fighter but will also let you guys see how I plan to manage this new, and extremely interesting, asset class.

My CryptoFighter Experience UpdatedThis week has been a lot of ups and downs. I’ve learned a lot and I’ve realized I’ve made a lot of mistakes! For example last week I bought all of my CryptoFighters from the marketplace. Since playing and joining the CryptoFighter Discord Channel I’ve found out about a third party site called Opensea.io. Opensea is a store for buying CryptoFighters, and other cryptocollectibles, for cheaper than what they are offered on the main marketplace. This would have saved me quite a bit in comparison to what I paid for my CryptoFighters. I actually am under-serving what all Opensea can do for you. It will also allow you to manage your Fighters in a deeper way than what is provided on CryptoFighters.io. Not only does it support gifting, in addition to the marketplace above, you can also view your account’s history to see what you paid for each Fighter.

This will enable your community to pool resources on the Steem blockchain and use one account to upvote everyone’s post, who is a member of the group, at a described rate. For a more detailed write up of the features of Community Bot check out @yabapmatt’s release post here. RequirementsFor this tutorial you will need the following accounts to get started: Steemit Account Amazon Web Services Account with a Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (HVM) instance running DifficultyEither choose between the following options: Intermediate Prerequisites Download &amp; Install PuTTY 0.70 Convert your Amazon Key pair from a .pem file to a .ppk file. You can read this guide, starting at Converting Your Private Key Using PuTTYgen, to learn how to easily convert your keys. NotesAs we go through I will be providing code commands in the form of 1$ This is what code commands will look like If you see multiple lines beginning with $ then run each line as it’s own command.12$ This is what code commands will look like$ This is what code commands will look like Also if you come across a command that contains [brackets] then replace the bracketed information with your own. Getting Started1.) Find your server’s IP address from Amazon’s EC2 Dashboard and write it down.You will be looking for Public DNS (IPv4) which for this picture would be ec2-52-37-160-82.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com. 2.) Open PuTTY and configure Host Name using:1ubuntu@[AWS Server Public DNS (IPv4)] 3.) Click the expand beside SSH then click Auth. Now using the ‘Browse’ find your .ppk file you converted from your .pem. 4.) You can now click Open on PuTTY to launch a SSH into your server. Note: I recommend going back to the top level ‘Session’, on the left side, before hitting ‘Open’. This will allow you to create a saved session first. Simply type a name for the session under ‘Saved Session’ and hit the ‘Save’ button. After this you won’t need to type in your PuTTY host or auth files as the session details can be loaded from your saved session. 5.) Your first run will display an alert detailing that you’ve not yet cached your server’s keys. Simply select ‘Yes’. You’ve successfully SSH into your AWS server. Now it’s time to update your instance to ensure it has the latest code needed to run your bot. 6.) Software UpdateRun the following:12$ sudo apt-get update$ sudo apt-get upgrade -y You may get a prompt saying there is differing versions. I recommend selecting ‘keep the local version currently installed’. 7.) Install NodejsRun the following:123$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_9.x | sudo -E bash -$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs$ node -v The final command should report back that you are now on Node Version 9.9.0 or higher. 8.) Install NPMRun the following:12$ sudo npm install npm@latest -g$ sudo npm -v The final command should report that you are now on NPM Version 5.8.0 or higher. 9.) Install PM2Run the following:12$ sudo npm install pm2@latest -g$ sudo pm2 -v The final command should report that you are now on PM2 Version 2.10.1 or higher. 10.) Install Community BotRun the following:12345$ sudo git clone https://github.com/MattyIce/communitybot.git$ cd communitybot$ sudo npm install$ sudo npm install steem$ sudo mv config-example.json config.json You’ve now successfully installed Community Bot to your AWS. Now it’s time for us to configure your installation. 11.) Configure your config.json fileRun the following:1$ sudo vi config.json Using your cursor, update your config.json file with your Steem user’s information. Most items are fairly self explanatory for what they need but for a bit more detail you can visit the communitybot README. Once you’ve updated your bots configuration to your liking press the esc key. After pressing the esc key, enter the following: 1:wq 12.) You’re now ready to launch your bot.Run the following: 1$ nodejs communitybot.js 13.) You’ve done it! Extra credit:Right now CommunityBot is running directly in your PuTTY window. This isn’t the ideal way to operate as you would need to keep PuTTY open and connected at all time so the bot could continue working. To improve this we can move this process to PM2 so that communitybot will run directly from the server. To get started close your running PuTTY window and open a new one that is connected to your server. Now run the following: 12$ cd ~/communitybot$ pm2 start communitybot.js You’re now completely set up to run Community Bot from your AWS account. If you ever want to check the status of your PM2 instance run: 1$ pm2 status DisclaimerThis tutorial is written by a user of @yabapmatt’s tools. I have no relation to the project outside of using it’s tools myself. As I didn’t write the code I can not guarantee it’s full functions but have been using it myself personally. Since you will be giving the bot your Steem account’s Posting, Active and Memo keys you will be entrusting it with lots of responsibility. I recommend learning more on how to properly secure and harden your virtual server’s security. I take no responsibility in the event anyone loses access to their funds.

This comes off one of the Reds worst starts in memory as they currently sit at 3-15 after a loss to the Milwaukee Brewers last night. In the interim the Reds’ bench coach, Jim Riggleman, will step in to fill the shoes of manager. Louisville Bats, the Reds AAA affiliate, manager Pat Kelly and Pensacola (AA) pitching coach Danny Darwin will join the big league staff as interim pitching coach. The club will begin the search for a permanent replacement later in the year. President of baseball operations and general manager Dick Williams released the following statement Thursday: “At this time, we felt a change needed to happen in order to begin the process of getting this team back on the right track. We realize it is early in the season but feel it is important to be proactive. In addition to these staff changes, we will continue to examine all aspects of Baseball Operations to ensure we are doing everything we can to improve.” While the club’s expectations were not high for this season they certainly weren’t prepared for what they got with Price. After releasing Dusty Baker in 2013, Price took over the helm of the big league Reds with a load of hope for a turn around. Instead the club finished in last place every year from 2015-17, and went 279-387 (.419) under Price overall. Not quite up to expectations.

While trading will probably resume after services are ensured to be operating normally it reiterates that crypto platforms are still new and changing. Bitstamp To Sell Exchange To Nexon?It appears that Business Insider is reporting that Bitstamp, one of the oldest Bitcoin exchanges, may be selling itself to Counterstrike creator Nexon for $350 million. This would be huge news in my opinion but also a bad deal for the exchange. I would imagine their value as being much higher than just $350 million with Poloniex selling for $400 million recently.

Select the Lightning Payment option in the upper right corner of the payment screen followed by ‘Copy’. 6.) Copy the payment address to your clipboard. (Hitting the lightning icon in the lower left will copy to your clipboard) 7.) Open a second window for Coinpanic’s Community Jar and paste your payment address on the right side under ‘Take from Jar’ 8.) Make sure your have both windows open side by side before clicking ‘Pay Invoice’. You’ll want to see this! 9.) Hit ‘Pay Invoice’ but keep watching your order. 10.)

I found that time wouldn’t be a problem but planning the expenses of a trip like this so quickly could be more of an issue. That’s when I decided I would try to make the trip off of Steem earnings alone. HistoryI remember in the early days of Bitcoin there were always articles written about how someone tried living off Bitcoin for a week or tried to travel to some place only using Bitcoin. I always found these extremely interesting just off the fact that it showed this new technology was usable and was allowing actual people the opportunity to make use of the currency regularly. I feel this is an extremely powerful narrative. It reinforces that not only can these currencies be actually used but also helps break a lot of the cognitive dissonance that the media has laid out about cryptocurrencies in general. I want to now adjust this narrative a bit to adding the caveat that I will only be spending BTC that I’ve earned through the Steem platform. It’s my hope that this will now allow others to see that not only can you earn a few pennies for your blog post you can even make amazing things like a trip to NY happen. My RulesThis is going to be a fairly simple gig. I’m going to start with $100 worth of BTC when I leave Lexington, KY on my journey and will be forced to earn anything I spend extra directly from Steem. This means I won’t be taking any fiat or even credit cards (I will still be using my BitPay card for any expenses that won’t allow me to spend BTC directly.) If I run out of money then I will just need to make a new post and hope one of you gracious Steemians help me out with some upvotes.Now to ensure I’m not waiting for a week in NYC for my posts to reach their curation reward I am going to spend Steem before it’s actually issued to me. The way I will do this is after posting a post if it earns $5 then I will just spend $5 worth of Steem/BTC that I am already holding. Anything that happens to a post after I “cash out” will be considered a wash out. I will also give myself the benefit of using this post as extra funds for the trip.There’s also one additional benefit that I’m allowing myself for this trip that some others may not have access to. That is my earnings from my delegation to @dlivepromoter. Since I have delegated so much SP to this bot I get a daily payout of anywhere from 1 to 3 Steem. Since this is from funds I’ve placed on Steem and is coming from the overall community I’m allowing these funds to give me at least a guaranteed source of money (even if it is less than $10 a day) that I can have available for making it home. While it gives me something stable I will still be primarily relying on the graciousness of your votes to make it back.## Join Me!I hope I can encourage you to join me for this trip! I am very much looking forward to meeting everyone from @dlive on May 18th but would love to meet even more people along the way! Do you live in Ohio, Pennsylvania or near NYC? I would love to take the time to sit down and have a coffee with you to learn more about your story. If you’d be interested please shoot me a message or leave a comment and maybe we can arrange a stop on my trip for a bit.While I hope to meet many of you along the way I’m also hoping that if you can’t be there physically that you will join me through Steemit. I’m going to try to document and share this entire journey here and hope you will be an active part of it. This means you will see lots of Steepshot posts and even short DLive streams, when my internet connection is strong enough to support it, of the trip. Please take the time to give me local suggestions and encouragement. I will definitely need it :)You’ll be able to follow all of these adventures directly from my Steemit page at https://steemit.com/@patrickulrich.## Final ThoughtsWith my final thoughts I’ll end this with all of the gratitude I have for everyone on this platform. You each join me here daily with kind words and encouragement so I can never tell you how much it means. I’m attempting a dream every day and it’s all because of each of you!

Pizza Day","text":"Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day!Back on May 22, 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz made the first retail bitcoin transaction when he bartered 10,000 BTC for 2 Papa John’s Pizzas. At current prices those two pizzas would be worth a smooth $82 million. Tasty, huh? This was a huge event for cryptocurrencies though. While Bitcoin had been around for over a year it was only used in geeky circles as a pastime and concept. This finally gave a reference point for what the value of a bitcoin could be established at. Now 8 years later we simply value Pizza a whole lot less than we do a BTC (at the time this would have been worth about $40.) This event has birthed new Pizza milestones for our favorite crypto too. Earlier this year Lazlo returned to make the first ever Lightning powered Bitcoin transaction when he paid 649000 satoshis, or 0.00649 bitcoins, which equals around $62 for both pizzas. (It seems the only thing dropping in these valuations is the reference $) Add Pizza Day Tracker To Your WebsiteThis morning Coindesk announced that they have released a neat Pizza Day graphic (seen above) that you can embed on your own website. Simply copy the following code and you’ll have an updating Pizza Day price graphic ready for your website today. 12&lt;div id=&quot;coindesk-btc-pizza-widget&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;//widget.coindesk.com/bpiticker/coindesk-bitcoin-pizza-widget.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; Steem Powered Pizza?This made me stop to think if there’s been a Steem Pizza Day yet? If not I’d like to be the first person to make it happen! If you are willing to order me two Pizzas for delivery tonight at 6pm then I will pay $40 worth of STEEM/SBD (roughly 12.780 STEEM or 18.100 SBD) to make it happen. The OrderIf you would like to be the one to make the first Steem powered Pizza Day a reality then comment below! After we agree on who will order the pizza I will let you call my local Big City Pizza (I wanted to stick with Papa Johns but they didn’t want to work with me on the delivery) and tell them you have a delivery order for Patrick. After they receive the order and payment I’ll then send your choice of STEEM/SBD back for the purchase. Big City Pizza - 859.885.0111 Pizza #1 - Large VeggiePizza #2 - Large Meat Pizza The order total should be around $35 from what I’ve been told by the shop so I will essentially be paying someone $5 to buy $35 worth of Steem.

Have you heard of Fundition.io yet? It’s a crowdfunding platform (think Kickstarter or GoFundMe) but built on the Steem blockchain. I just accepted a role of becoming a Fundition Angel to begin helping new users find out as much as possible about the site and community. I’ve answered a few generic questions below but if you have any more please let me know in the comments or shoot me an email and I’ll be happy to get back to you!## What is crowdfunding?Crowdfunding allows you to post a request for funding where anyone can then contribute towards your project to help you get the financial resources you need to get make it a reality! Crowdfunding has been used to help a wide range of projects take off ranging from huge platforms like Oculus Rift all the way down to personal needs.## What makes Fundition different?There’s too many reasons to list here! Fundition is completely disrupting the traditional crowdfunding model by offering features that no other site has offered to date. It’s the first project that is built on Steem allowing people to contribute without them having to spend their own money. Beyond that Fundition changes the game by making contributions immediately available directly from your backers with no fee as a middle man! If that doesn’t seem amazing just think that most sites take at least 3% from founders right off the top of their project. What can I request funding for on Fundition.io?Here’s the exciting part, anything! Do you have an idea that can change the face of Steem but no money to make it a reality? Post it up and explain your goals! Want to start your own business but no funds to start off? Get creative and build some support! Need money to help you pay a medical expense that is overwhelming you? Fret not you might find a generous soul that is willing to back you. How can I help back someone’s project?There’s a few methods to help someone achieve their goals. Just like any other funding site you can contribute money to their project in the form of a donation. Donations can be done by using your Steem or SBD but can also be made with most other major cryptocurrencies. Soon there will even be options to use traditional fiat methods for sending hearts to your favorite projects! Beyond sending money directly another innovative change is the ability to send value by just upvoting posts by the founder. These ‘free hearts’ don’t cost you anything but still contribute hearts towards a projects success. Imagine what that could mean for your group’s success! The most interesting way to contribute without sending any money is by acting as a collaborator to a project. Collaborators can work with founders to make updates that will bring in more funds while also raising visibility to the projects success. Just another reason that Fundtion is a real game changer compared to the old methods of raising funds! Where do I get started?To get started on your Fundtion journey head over to https://fundition.io//#!/join and start by logging in with your Steem credentials. If you’ve not yet signed up for Steem you can also create a new account from the same page for no cost at all! After you check out the site be sure to stop in the Fundition Discord channel. We have a ton of great individuals, from across the world, willing to help you get your project just right to find support! You can also feel free to reach out to me and I’m more than happy to answer any questions you may have! Just shoot me an email and I’ll be more than happy to get you answer! Email: patrickulrich@fundition.io I’m so excited for finding this project and can’t wait to see all the dreams that end up coming true! If you end up having any more questions please let me know below. Also if you found a project leave a link in the comments and I’ll be sure to check it out. I might even feature a post about your project in the future! Join a community with heart based giving at its core!

Not only will this help @dlive but should also help Steem in general as new users come towards the platform for all of the right reasons. To spread the attention I’ve been submitting a letter, similar to the following, to each tech and Android based blog that I follow or know about: 1234567891011121314151617Good morning,I wanted to share about a new app that was released for Google Play that may interest your readership due to recent hype cycles. DLive, a blockchain (think Bitcoin if you&apos;re not familiar) based content delivery platform, has released an Android app (before releasing an iOS version) that allows viewers to stay connected to their favorite streams on the go.I could easily go into many deeper details on DLive, also the Steem blockchain that it&apos;s built on, but will let you dig deeper for yourself. It&apos;s essentially a way to monetize content by enlisting the crowd intelligence to what is &apos;quality&apos; content. There were a couple publications that covered the release yesterday:Venture Beat - https://venturebeat.com/2018/06/20/dlive-launches-blockchain-based-livestreaming-platform-on-android/Android Authority - https://www.androidauthority.com/dlive-blockchain-live-streaming-android-app-878443/Phone Arena - https://www.phonearena.com/news/DLive-android-app-download-live-streaming-blockchain_id105956Today the app was approved for the Play Store and can be found at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.dlive&amp;rdid=io.dlive if you&apos;d want to give it a test. You won&apos;t need a Steem profile to view streams and can get set up using just your Google account. Outside of being an active streamer on their platform as well as the Steem blockchain in general I am not affiliated with DLive. However I do hold Steem as a currency so I want to be clear about my potential bias and level of affiliation. That said it is an incredible distribution channel to deliver any content. If you would have any additional questions about this app or using this platform and how it works I would be happy to detail any questions you may have. Feel free to reach me at *my personal email address*.Thanks for taking the time to review my submission!Patrick Ulrich If even one new article is written that will expose our platform to that many more people and hopefully bring on new users. Even better is if a past Steem user can see it and see that there is real innovation happening here and maybe bring them back to using the platform again. How You Can Help!Join me in letting your favorite blog know about the launch. The more their readership is sending in tips about the launch the more interest they will have in telling the rest of their audience.

You can read more about the launch at https://steemit.com/dlive/@dlive/announcement-or-dlive-on-android-with-fanbase or start the download for your device at https://app.dlive.io/. It’s an amazing start! That being said I’ve been dying to get home to give it a good testing. While digging through I’ve encountered the following bugs that I want to share with the team. Some of these have already been reported in DLive’s #help-center while others may be new. To test I was using a Samsung Note 8 running Android 8.0.0 and version 1.0.0 of the DLive app downloaded from the main website. Bugs or Interface IssuesAppearance &amp; AppAndroid app missing app icon logoUnder “Live” panel - streams not shown under ‘Lifestyle’, ‘Learning’ and ‘Music’ but will still appear in “Trending”Under “Profile” in earning history there is an overlay of stream ID and what I assume is dateUnder “Profile” clicking Fanbase doesn’t take you to that user’s profile but just the Fanbase tab VideosOpening a non-live video will give a ‘3101: User Not Found’ error. (posted by @D4rkFlow) StreamsUpvote less than 100% will give 10000:Server Internal ErrorUpvote of 100% will register as 1% upvote (both in chat and on steemd)After sending a gift and completing the SteemConnect payment then backing into the DLive app I get a recurring ‘Video loading failed’ - This has been inconsistent and has occurred for some streams and not on others.[Inconsistent] App FC after taking stream to full screen. Unable to reliably reproduce. FanbaseI almost didn’t include this because I know this is an alpha release of this feature. I still wanted to include information that may help the team locate an unknown issues. No way to join other’s Fanbase - You are able to create your own but can not join anyone elseOpen Fanbase chat in one Fanbase group but then open another Fanbase and click the chat and app will FCFanbase doesn’t appear to let you scroll chat messages based on DLive Fanbase Recommended UpdatesThis one has already been addressed but it would be awesome to utilize the @dlive app to go live straight from mobile. I know this is in the works but I would be amiss to not include this as the top recommended update. Again I’m sure this will be addressed soon but would again be missing a great opportunity to recommend Android push notifications. More developer information regarding rich notifications can be found here https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/engage/rich-notifications Utilize Android 8.0 picture in picture for streams. This would allow streamers to continue to stay connected to the stream even while donating or jumping into another quick app. You can learn more about Android’s PIP featuers at https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/picture-in-picture. When clicking a stream to load stream info (title, viewers, votes &amp; user) it would be nice to be able to click the user’s name to join past streams. Similarly clicking user profiles in chat should open their streaming profile allowing you to view their streams or profile info. More to Come!For an alpha release this is incredible. You can easily track and monitor streams with little issue! That is amazing considering the alpha nature of this release. That being said I hope any of this can help the team make the experience better and continue to improve. I’ve been traveling with my mother today so I’ve not had a lot of time to really dig in too deep and I’m exhausted at this point. I will continue to test and update this post as I find any issues. If you’ve noticed any additional issues please let me know in the comments and I will update my tracker to include your bug (with reference) if I can reproduce it.

After I thought about it I figured the best way to do it would be to share on Steem so even more people might be able to take advantage. If you notice any errors or have any questions please let me know in the comments below! Step 1 - Open www.dlive.io from you mobile’s browser Step 2 - Hit the hamburger menu in the upper right corner If you find that you are not signed into DLive you’ll want to go ahead and do that. Just hit ‘Sign in’ and use your Active Key to sign in via SteemConnect. If you are already signed in just jump to step 3. Step 3 - Under the hamburger menu drop down select ‘Upload Video’ Step 4 - Click the upload button Note: Your file can not be over 4GB in size and must be in .mp4 format. If you’re video is larger or is not that format you should be able to find a file converter in your phone’s store. Step 5 - Ensure you use your phone’s file system This may or may not be a popup you come into contact with. If your device has multiple file exploreres then you are free to use your preferred explorer. Just locate the file you want to use and select it from the file system. In this example you wouldn’t want to use the ‘Camcorder’ because we’ll be uploading a file that has already been recorded. Step 6 - Set your thumbnail This will be very similar to steps 4 &amp; 5. You’ll want to click the ‘Upload’ button but now you’ll be searching for your thumbnail picture to your video. Note: @dlive will work with JPG, PNG or GIF files on this part but you are limited to only a 2MB file. Again if you’re file is too big or not one of the supported file types then check your phone’s Store to locate an app that can convert for you. Step 7 - Update your video information In this step you’ll make sure your posting information is set how you want it. You will need to provide a title, video description, video category, video language and the tags that are associated with it. This information is what others will see when they try to find your video so being more descriptive is definitely useful! Step 8 - Confirm your settingsBefore we hit the ‘Submit’ button we’ll want to review that we have everything where we want it. It is definitely possible to edit after a video is submitted but will require changing in multiple locations if you want to update your Steem post and DLive video so it’s definitely nice to be set before hitting submit. The other thing to look for is that the upload bar at the top of the page has completed and that your video is done uploading to the server. If it hasn’t finished by this point then just give it some more time and it should upload shortly. Once you’re ready to go just hit the purple ‘Submit’ at the bottom of the page. That’s itYou’ve just posted your video to DLive and documented it on the Steem blockchain! You should now be able to see the video on your Steem page and be able to watch it immediately.

Opportunity To Increase Your Steem Power","text":"I seen @mrviquez do a livestream earlier to assist people with their Byteball airdrop and thought it was a great idea. Now I want to play a little Fortnite and I thought what better way to do it than helping people during rounds! What is Byteball?Byteball is another digital currency that is built to help do ICOs. They offer an innovative way to ensure anyone offering an ICO is only accepting accredited investors. How is it going to help me earn more Steem Power?Byteball decided to offer a free airdrop to anyone with a Steem account at a certain rep. This means you will receive free Byteball that you can convert into Steem and then power up for a larger vote! How much SP will I get?This depends on your Steem REP and how much you’ll be able to sell them for on the exchange. This is what Byteball will distribute: Steem reputation 30 and above: you get a $10 rewardSteem reputation 40 and above: you get a $20 rewardSteem reputation 50 and above: you get a $40 rewardSteem reputation 60 and above: you get a $80 rewardSteem reputation 70 and above: you get a $160 reward You only get half available today but you’ll get the other half one year from today after it’s released in a smart contract. How do I redeem my airdrop Byteball?Follow these steps in order:1.) Download the Byteball Wallet here 2.) You’ll need a few bytes to send as a payment to link your address to your Steem account. Send me a message on Discord (@patrickulrich) and I’ll forward you enough to cover the payment. (You can find me in the @dlivecommunity, @dlive or @fundition Discords if we aren’t connected.) 3.) Once you’ve received your Bytes then click on the chat section in the lower right followed by ‘bot store’ in the upper portion. Then look for the ‘Steem attestation bot’ to get started on connecting your Steem account to Byteball. 4.) Now it’s going to ask you to enter the address of the wallet you want to attest. Click the icon at the bottom left and choose “Insert my address” and press the send button to send it to the bot. 5.) The bot will now generate a link for you to verify you account via SteemConnect. Follow that and sign in with your Steem credentials. 6.) It will ask if you want to do a public or private registration. Public allows anyone to search by your Steem username to send you bytes to this address in the future. I chose public. 7.) Now you will send your payment for the attestation by clicking the ‘Payment request: 49000 bytes link.’ This is why you needed to wait to have me send some bytes to make the payment. 8.) As soon as that payment is processed the bot will send you your airdrop funds. How do I turn my Bytes in Steem Power?I’m converting my bytes using Bittrex. Once you sell them on the exchange you can just send them to your Steem wallet and then power up to increase your Steem Power. It was that easy! Now let’s go find a llama together.

I’ve been following the idea behind User Authority for some time so seeing their release is extremely exciting for me. What is User Authority?The best way I’ve seen anyone describe it is to compare it to Google’s PageRank that they’ve used to determine search engine results. The difference here is that they are applying this to user profiles and posts. Essentially they are able to determine a user’s rankings on the Steem chain by who you are connected to which enables a much better basis for identifying “good” users on Steem. For example if you are new and have no followers then your UA will be much lower than someone that has tons of connections to other users. What’s even better is that if you are connected to a network of 100,000 spam accounts that just post nothing material then your UA would be lower than someone that has 100 followers who are good Steemians and are a strong part of the community. It’s able to accomplish this task by determining who follows you and unfollows you. Each block their algorithm will look at who is in your follower graph, along with who left your graph, and assign a score. This is amplified by your connection back to the witnesses we elect on the Steem chain. So if you are followed directly by a bunch of the witnesses then your UA will be much stronger. For each level of separation from the witnesses, or other high ranked UA users, then their increase to your rank becomes slightly lower. TL;DR - User Authority &gt; Current Rep System How can I find my UA? You can find your own UA score by visiting https://steem-ua.com/. From there simply click the ‘View Your UA Score’ link then sign in with SteemConnect to determine your score. Unfortunately due to server load you can only see your score on this link plus the top 100 UA accounts from the main page. That being said if you’re interested to what mine would look like then you can see this screenshot: That being said if you’re not already following me please think about doing so. I’d love to surpass a 5000 UA rank! :) Why is UA important?User Authority is one of the biggest innovations for our chain in a while in my humble opinion. It will allow developers to build in features that utilize people’s rank to better filter out spam or abuse. These are just a few ideas that I’ve seen tossed around or have thought up: Bid Bot Rank RequirementsI can’t take full credit for this because @smartsteem is already working to do this from my understanding. Imagine though that instead of allowing any user to buy bids you would only allow users with a UA of say 1. This would help to ensure that content that is actually useful is being promoted while spammers are unable to use the service. I think it would go a long way towards ending the animosity towards these types of services and ensure that trending is more reserved for actual ‘good’ content. I happen to think this is so important that I’ve actually submitted an issue request for the open source Post Promoter project to begin integrating UA options into bidbots. I sincerely hope to see this looked at and more options for bot operators to become available. Trending PagesSpeaking of trending this could be another great use. If you use any of the popular condensers like Busy.org or Steempeak.com they could eventually integrate UA to help you filter posts. This would allow you to see what well vetted individuals are posting without having to sort through the waves of nothing posts that are promoted by bidbots or other voting buying services. You could essentially filter to just the most connected users. The options are really endless! AirdropsIf you’re not familiar, Byteball recently offered an airdrop to Steemians based on our current rep system. Unfortunately the current system is fairly easy to game by using high repped bid bots to buy promotion on posts and improve your own. This allowed many spammers to create new accounts and then promote posts to redeem lots of Byteballs that they probably shouldn’t have received. With a UA rank this would be much harder to accomplish as it would be much tougher to move up the rankings of UA. From some comments on the official release announcement it seems that they are already looking into doing just this for Byteball in the future! Many, Many MoreThese were just a few examples but I’m sure you can put your imagination to many more opportunities. With the ability to determine an account’s true reputation there are endless apps that can be built that were only slightly possible before but would have been far to easy to game to be efficient. Now some even more serious innovation can begin taking place. I’d love to hear some of your ideas in the comments below! I want to learn more!The best place to start is going to be the @steem-ua steem account. They will be releasing many more updates so following them should help keep you in the know.

You may have yet not even realized it. It is Cody Wilson’s open-source organization that develops digital firearms files that you should be allowed to download from his site and use to print or mill your own firearms. Unfortunately there are those in America that don’t believe in our freedom of speech or right to bear arms and have done their best to limit those rights. If you have heard of this project it’s probably from the recent court battles that Cody has devoted himself to. After initially creating blueprints that would allow anyone with a 3D printer to print a firearm back in 2012 the United States State Department stepped in and gave Cody an ultimatum to either remove the ability to download these prints or go to jail. Cody made the decision to take them down but the fight doesn’t end there. In 2015, Cody’s company, Defense Distributed decided to sue the State department seeking a preliminary injunction to allow the information to exist online. This, to me, sounds like a cut and dry case. You have, in the US Constitution, the right that the government will not prohibit the free exercise or abridging the freedom of speech. Since these plans are simply digital information then I do not see how anyone, who believes in our rights to free speech, could justify the move to censoring Cody’s ability to distribute his information. Unfortunately the courts did just that. Again, the story doesn’t end there. Defense Distributed continued the fight by appealing to the US Supreme Court in January but they rejected his appeal of the lower court’s decision. This led many, including myself, to feel that we might not be seeing justice for our rights. That was until on June 29th the State Department agreed to settle with Defense Distributed and allow the plans to be posted online. I remember sharing that news release with many, many friends as if we had just won a huge battle. That was until, hours before the plans were scheduled to be back on the site, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order to prevent the settlement from moving forward. This has recently led to District Judge Robert Lasnik granting a preliminary injunction which will bar the blueprints from being posted online for free distribution until a court case is resolved. How does Steem come into this?The first part is that Steem will finally end this type of censorship. While governments may require certain condensers to stop showing select content, based on their geographic hosting location inside of the United States, they will never be able to remove a post from the actual blockchain. That means if Cody’s designs were to be posted here they could not be removed from the actual chain regardless of what the courts were trying to demand. That in of itself is a game changer but that’s not all. It’s Not Just The Government Censoring CodyYouTube has deleted every Ghost Gunner and DEFCAD video I’ve ever made.— Cody R. Wilson (@Radomysisky) September 1, 2018 This morning @radomysisky, Cody Wilson’s Twitter handle, posted that YouTube has deleted every piece of Ghost Gunner’s content he’s ever made from their site. This, to my knowledge, was without warning. He just logged in and it was gone. I can certainly sympathize as the same thing happened to me last year when Google, YouTube’s parent, took down my Bitcoin collection on their social networking platform. This also shows that government censorship is no longer the only thing to fear and potentially not even the worse part to fear. That’s because platforms like Google’s aren’t covered by our Bill of Rights. That’s because they are not government properties and presumably have the right to allow what content they want on their own platforms. While I support their rights to allow what meets their needs, I can clearly see how this could become an issue for individuals like Cody and myself. This is why I moved all of my content production to Steem! Steem ensures that what we post will be distributed across the globe to our beloved blockchain and that no one will be able to stop that from happening. I don’t have to worry if someone will take over Steemit Inc who doesn’t believe in liberty. They can’t censor the blockchain. I’ve now sent messages to Cody in hopes he will do the same thing! How can I help stop this kind of censorship?You can start by sending messages of encouragement to Cody on Twitter. While you’re there please consider liking and retweeting my reply to his announcement this morning where I offered to set him up and reupload all old content to our beloved dapps that are built on Steem. @Radomysisky you should bring them over to @OfficialDLive on the Steem blockchain! They will not be deleted here. Plus maybe you can earn enough Steem from them that you can send me a Ghost Gunner! — Patrick Ulrich (@patrick_ulrich) September 1, 2018 The more Cody can realize that his message can have a reach on this platform then the more likely he will be willing to pursue using our platform. The second thing you can do is help fund Cody’s battle against tyranny. If you head over to https://defcad.com/donate/ you will be able to join the fight by donating Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or good ole fiat. For the first time in my life I will encourage you to convert your funds to Bitcoin Cash to donate to this cause. That’s because Bitcoin.com is sponsoring this project and will match any donations submitted using Bitcoin Cash. I don’t even feel dirty to say that in this cause!

Shortly after that I was getting a response from the Controller of @edgewallet, PayneFullHuman, saying to go ahead and upload some content and asking me to send the new account’s keys over! Secret Mission, Shh! Don’t Tell!!!I’m not going to lie that I have a secret mission with getting @edgewallet to try out DLive. My hope is that they will see how easy it is for individuals to make an income from Steem and possibly begin supporting it in their multi-asset cryptocurrency wallet. This wallet has been downloaded over 50k times on Android plus is available on iOS! Imagine the exposure we could get from having one of the best wallets in the industry support STEEM! Even better is if they would begin support account creation from inside the wallet. What if someone logged into the Edge Wallet for the first time to be greeted with a message that they now support a currency that allows people to share on an uncensorable network and even earn some rewards while doing it? That would be some excellent tie-ins! Try it out!If you’ve never tried out Edge then I would recommend heading over to edge.app and giving it a spin. It makes utilizing crypto a breeze and supports a wide range of currencies like BTC, ETH, LTC, XMR, XRP, BCH, DASH, REP and many more! Plus it utilizes a cool technology they introduced with their Airbitz wallet that’s now called Edge Login. Edge Login allows you to create a much more memorable sign in with a basic username and password as opposed to keeping up with your private keys. It really helps newbies get started in crypto! Speaking of newbies it will even allow you to buy crypto from within the wallet. This means that if you need to buy Steem you can get some BTC directly from Edge and then send it to @blocktrades to be converted to Steem! How easy is that!

Coming into the game Kentucky had lost to Florida for the last 31 years but with a hard fought battle the Wildcats were able to defeat the Gators in a 27-16 battle. The game was a nail biter moving into the last 5 minutes of the game. Kentucky had led 21-10 but gave up a 4th quarter touchdown with 3:43 remaining that brought the score within 5. It was becoming eerily reminiscent of years prior when the Cats were able to make the game close but ultimately not able to shut down Florida. I was sitting with memories of last year’s devastating loss where the Cats gave up a touchdown in the last minute of the game leaving the streak unbroken. Fortunately that’s not how this year was going to go! After Benny Snell was unable to push our last offensive possession into a new first down, Kentucky punter Max Duffy made it tough for Florida by placing a punt down to the 6 yard line. This gave the Gators 29 seconds to move 94 yards down the field. The Gators were able to make a completion to move the ball up the field but without having any timeouts left they had to move quick. This led Florida’s QB Feleipe Franks to drop an incomplete pass to stop the clock. Lining up with 9 seconds remaining Florida’s Franks stepped back to throw another deep pass. That was until senior Kentucky linebacker Josh Allen, who had already been instrumental in stopping a two point conversion on the 4th quarter touchdown, forced a fumble on the final pass. Kentucky safety, Davonte Robinson, ended up with the ball but nearly tossed it to the refs thinking the play had ended in an incomplete pass. He then pushed over Florida’s Tyler Jordan to end the game with another Kentucky touchdown. The streak had been broken! It might have been 31 years of losing but tonight the Cats went into The Swamp and walked out victorious! They will attempt to continue their undefeated season next weekend against the Murray State Raiders in a home game at Commonwealth Stadium. I’m extremely excited for this season and look forward to what these guys are going to be able to put together. Go Cats!

Do you want to ensure that your content doesn’t get migrated over to the new platform while still retaining a copy of your videos that you worked so hard to create? I’m going to attempt to lay out what I know as being the best options to do just that in this post. Downloading Your DLive Video UploadsThis process is only for videos that you’ve uploaded to DLive. It will most likely not work for anything you’ve streamed. I will detail that process below. 1.) Use CTRL + Shift + I to go into the Developer Tools of your browser (I’m using Chrome in this example)2.) Go to Network and apply the Media filter to sort out the rest of the page elements. If you don’t see Network use the &gt;&gt;arrows to see it on the dropdown. 3.) Navigate over to your DLive video’s URL and you should see your video populate in the file section. 4.) Right click on your video file and then ‘Open in new tab’ 5.) Use the menu button in the lower right hand corner of your video to find the ‘Download’ option. This will begin downloading the video to your computer. Download a copy of your DLive streamsThis is a bit more complicated. That’s because streams aren’t saved as single video file like a video upload is. Instead streams are actual a playlist of multiple little videos stitched together to create a stream. To download them you will need to install a bit of extra software to your computer. 1.) Head over to http://jdownloader.org to begin downloading the jDownloader software. Note: Be sure as you are install jdownloader to watch for bundled software. You can also perform this task using VLC but I have not included full instructions for that here. 2.) Open the stream you will want to download and add /edit to the end of it. That will make the URL look like this DLIVESTREAMURL/edit. 3.) Right click on your stream video and select ‘Copy video address’ 4.) Open jDownloader and click ‘Add New Links’ at the bottom left. 5.) It will likely auto fill your clipboard into the field but if not paste your video address into the box next to the + with a magnifying glass beside it. Click ‘Continue’ 5b.) If you don’t have the necessary codecs installed you may be prompted to install another package. Follow that process and then repeat the steps to get to this point from there. 6.) You will see your videos playlist listed along with it’s availability. Now just hit ‘Start all Downloads’ in the lower right hand side of the jDownloader program. 7.) Let the download finish running and you should have a copy stored in your Downloads folder after it finishes. Delete Your Content From DLiveIf you’ve followed the steps above you should now have a copy of the video safely stored on your computer. This means you can safely remove your content from the grasps of DLive. This will be a very simple process. 1.) Open your DLive stream or video and add edit like we done in a prior step. (eg DLIVEURL/edit) 2.) Scroll to the bottom of the page and you will see three buttons. Simply select ‘Delete’ and the video should be removed from DLive.

First it removed the traditional route of creating an account with at least .5 STEEM and a delegation. If your account was created through Steemit.com then this is how it was likely created. This route was replaced with a new creation method that will enable the creation of new users at a scale that was not possible before. Discounted Account TokensThis new method utilizes a new blockchain tool called Discounted Account Tokens. Each of these tokens can be redeemed to create a new Steem account without any STEEM cost to the creator. The only charge is against your rechargeable resource credits. This means anyone with enough resource credits to pay the fee can start storing account tokens to help on-board their friends and acquaintances in the future! This doesn’t mean that anyone can start claiming these discounted accounts though. In fact it requires a decent amount of RC to do so. At a bit over 5MM RC it’s really only feasible for accounts with at least 3,000 SP. It also took a bit of python knowledge until recently but now that new tools are rolling out that last part is changing. How To Claim Your Discounted AccountsI recently just found out, thanks to @abh12345’s excellent post, that SteemConnect has enabled the ability to claim discounted account tokens. The process is pretty simple but again you’ll want to make sure that you have at least 6MM RC available so that you’ll have enough to claim plus still have enough resource credits to use Steem afterwards. 1.) Copy “https://steemconnect.com/sign/claim_account?creator=YOURUSERNAME&amp;fee=0.000%20STEEM&amp;extensions=[]“ without including the “”. 2.) Replace YOURUSERNAME from the URL above with your Steem username. 3.) Sign the SteemConnect transaction with your active key. As long as you have enough RC to cover the transaction it will process and you will be the new owner of a pending claimed account. This means that you can now register a new Steem account for no charge at all and just pay with your claimed account token. To verify just visit https://steemd.com/@YOURUSERNAME with YOURUSERNAME replaced by your Steem account. Then look along the left side for the heading “Pending claimed accounts” to see how many account tokens you have access to. Claiming Your Reserved AccountTo my knowledge there’s currently no extremely user friendly tool to redeem your discounted account. That being said you can always claim using @holger80’s beem tool with these instructions. Note: you’ll need to have python installed on your machine to utilize this tool. That being said I imagine the SteemConnect Account Creation Tool will be updated with time to support this function as well. I will try to remember to update this post once I see that updated.

Steemhunt acts a lot like ProductHunt but is built for the Steem chain. As you seek out new products, upvote on other’s submissions or even comment on them you may be rewarded with STEEM tokens for your contribution to the community! It’s a wonderful way to interact with the Steem chain while sharing products you think others could benefit from or would find useful. Steemhunt is only going to keeping growing too. To create an economy of influencers they plan to expand the current Steemhunt into three sections. From their past Steem posts they describe these as: [Steemhunt] - a community where hunters introduce cool new products[Reviewhunt] - a marketing channel where makers suggest bounty missions for hunters[Ideahunt] - a Kickstarter-like platform where makers run crowdfunding campaigns for hunters Enter the SMT! Like a lot of other projects that are built on the Steem chain, SteemHunt will be issuing their own token known as HUNT. This will allow them to not only reward hunters with STEEM but also their own specialized HUNT token that you’ll be able to convert freely on the SMT marketplace. Before that happens though they will be offering them to users in the form of an airdrop that you can take advantage of now! As you can see in the graphic above up to 250 million of these tokens will be airdropped to the community in various forms. Steemhunt as a company will retain 150 million for their operations. Finally 100 million will be sold in private sales. Of these allocations, I’d like to dig a little bit deeper at the airdrop portion though. Up to 30M will be dropped to content contributors along with another 30M to those taking part in voting/promotion of those posts. These will be distributed at 120,000 tokens each day until the launch of the SMT with 60,000 for new hunts, 40,000 for those who upvote and 20,000 for those who resteem content. This will allow you to grow your share of the new platform by adding content to Steemhunt today. You can also earn today by sponsoring @steemhunt with a SP delegation to contribute a total of 45M new HUNT tokens. Each day Steemhunt will be distributing 90,000 tokens proportionately to those taking advantage of the program by releasing them based on each Steemians delegated portion of the total share of delegation. This is computed every Monday with a new sponsor report that you can find on the @steemhunt profile. Another 45M will be delivered to users who refer new users to the platform. This will be calculated at 90,000 tokens each day with 1/n at a maximum cap of 5,000 per person. Unfortunately this portion is not ready to be taken advantage of as the referral interface isn’t set up yet. Once it goes live then you will not only earn tokens but your referree will do the same. The majority of this airdrop is actually going on now in the form of an airdrop to SP holders that will be ending soon. This is available to any Steemian who takes advantage of claiming before September 13th, 2018. Once you hit your Steemhunt wallet you’ll see a ‘SP Claim’ button that will allocate you with a 1:1 airdrop based on your SP. So far there’s only been a little over 13M HUNT claimed by 5,107 Steemians. You can start your allocation now at https://steemhunt.com/wallet. I’m fortunate that @ericwilson mentioned this to me as I could have easily let my share be burned. I hope you will consider utilizing this platform. While you will continue earning STEEM you will also be gathering a new token that you will be able to trade come March when the SMT market becomes live. Who knows what these tokens will be worth in relation to STEEM but anything will help you gain in the SP leaderboard and thus help you advance that much more!

I finally sat down and spent enough time playing with Share2Steem to really get a feel for it. I now think it may be the thing to help red pill all of my normal friends into using a form of the Steem blockchain! What is Share2Steem?It’s a new dapp built for the Steem blockchain that lets you bring content from your Twitter, Instagram or YouTube over to your Steem account. This means when you post a new tweet or picture they can show on your Steem profile like native Steem content. I think this could end up being the ultimate tool for new users to begin dipping their toes in the Steem waters while maintaining their traditional social media interfaces. All you need to do, after linking your accounts, to make a Steem post is use your traditional social media and use the tag #share2steem in the post. With that they will convert your tweets, pics and videos into a Steem post and you don’t have to do a thing. If you want to see a couple examples from my attempts earlier check this out: Twitter - https://steemit.com/share2steem/@patrickulrich/patrickulrich-1540241668237-patrickulrichs-twitter-feed--20181022-225428 Instagram - https://steemit.com/share2steem/@patrickulrich/patrickulrich-1540249777834-patrickulrichs-instagram-update--20181023-010937 How do I get setup?1.) Head over to Share2Steem start by hitting ‘Let’s Go’ 2.) You’ll want to have a Steem account to link to your traditional social media. If you don’t have a Steem account head over to https://signup.steemit.com/ to get one set up. If you do then you’ll want to say yes on the next page. 3.) Now it’s time to sign in with your Steem account. You won’t be signing in via their website but instead be sent to SteemConnect which protects your personal passwords from being shared with Share2Steem. 4.) Now that you’ve signed in it’s time to link your first social media account. This process is fairly straight forward. You’ll just want to click the social media account that you want to verify then click ‘Next Step’. 5.) For this example I chose Twitter but you may want to do a different one. Regardless the steps are fairly the same and if you follow the instructions you shouldn’t have any problems. That being said to verify you’ll just insert your Twitter handle on the screen if you selected that platform. 6.) Now that you’ve identified your Twitter handle you’ll just need to follow the instructions to add their special code to your Twitter bio. Each bio code should be different but once you’ve updated your profile with the code just ‘Verify Account’. 7.) Now you’re ready to go. Whenever you want a tweet (or IG/YT) to be included to Steem just included #share2steem in the body of the post. That will let Share2Steem know your intentions and carry it over. How do I use it?It is very simple once you’re set up your social profiles. Whenever you make a post on Instagram, Twitter or YouTube just include the #share2steem in the body of your post. That’s it! They will take care of the rest and make the Steem post for you from there. How can I customize the Steem post’s title?There’s a couple ways I can answer that. The first is by including a prebuilt title in the body of your post using brackets [] around it. Whatever you include in the middle of these will become your Steem post’s title. You can also log into Share2Steem.com and go to Medias &gt; The Network You Want to Update &gt; Your Profile and from there be able to set a custom title for when you don’t include brackets on a post. By default it includes your name, social network used and the date of the post but you can customize this in a number of ways! How can I include custom tags for my Steem post?All you have to do to tag your post is include what tags you want as additional hashtags. The first hashtag of the post will become your post’s main category and then you can include up to four more along with your #share2steem tag. Is Share2Steem safe to use?This was one of the first questions I had about the service in the comments of my first posts on their service. I personally think it’s very safe. They use SteemConnect to manage your keys so you never actually have to worry about them having control of your funds. Additionally when you verify the account you don’t give them access to your social media. Instead you just add a special code to your bios and they use that to verify your Twitter identity. This means you don’t need to worry about them taking over any of your social profiles. Do they take a beneficiary?They do take a 10% beneficiary to help support their costs. This puts them on par with DTube but cheaper than Steepshot and Zappl. How does the referral process work?Coming off the question about the beneficiary this is an excellent topic. They actually will split their beneficiary rewards with you if you sign people up for the service. That means if you refer someone they will only take 6% and let you retain 4% for you referral’s posts. This means you can now earn by getting your friends to try out Steem! Can I customize my post style?You sure can! After you link your account you can log in to Steem2Share and go to the medias tab followed by the social site you wish to update. Once you’re there you can update the way it makes a title or body for your Steem post. Future UpdatesShortly after using it for the first time one of the people behind it, @algo.coder, dropped by post and gave some details. He told me they are still working to perfect the conversion of posts but are also looking to add new social sites to be able to pull data from. He mentioned the following sites as possible future updates: TwitchWordPressTumblrFacebook I certainly hope they are able to continue their success from this early release. As I said before this platform could be a huge way to help new users begin to adopt Steem in their everyday lives. What are you waiting for?

I’m not really sure how this will turn out but the concept is amazing and is one of the best use cases I’ve envisioned for SMTs when they launch early next year. If you’ve not heard of @dclick you can learn more from their introductory post linked below. Essentially they will allow you to create posts that feature an advertisement at the bottom of the page that, when clicked, earns you rewards in the form of DCLICK. These DCLICK tokens will be listed as SMTs once the protocol is released and will be used to allow advertisers to purchase space on blogs. Additionally they will allow you to trade your DCLICKs in for upvotes until the launch of SMTs so you can begin monetizing content on the blockchain. This is an excellent opportunity for a couple reasons. One is that you will be able to open new revenue streams from the same content you’re already creating. It also means you can earn rewards from non-steem users when they click any of the promoted links on your content. This should help any users who need that extra bit more to add to their Steem coffers. Potentially more important is that this helps your content continue monetization past the 7 day post payouts that normal Steem posts are limited by. That’s because even after your post pays out it’s reward the link will still be on your content and available to be clicked on by your followers. I ran into this issue often when referring people to test out DLive. On sites like YouTube they would be rewarded if someone watched a video even 2 years after it was posted. That’s because YouTube still had the ability to show advertisements on a video. On Steem if their followers didn’t upvote before payout then they wouldn’t get an rewards for creating content. That can all begin to change now! If you’re interested in what I just envisioned don’t go to their site expecting the full suite of tools you’ll find on Adsense though. It’s certainly not at that point yet since it’s just a beta test. That being said I can see the value this approach can facilitate and will certainly be watching this project with close attention.

I enjoy spending more time outdoors and being able to catch a good baseball game. That being said I force myself to remember that there are seasons for a reason. A harsh winter only makes those first few days of spring that much more enjoyable. It makes you cherish those first 65 degree days when you start to see the birds flying back in. So I guess I’ll learn to cherish my wintery snag before the days of planting a garden and spring training in baseball come back around to us.

Two years ago I was reading a Coindesk article about this new cryptocurrency that was trying to tie social networking with a digital currency. It seemed like a wild idea so I hesitated joining at first but ended up making the plunge. Two years later and you could easily say that Coindesk article changed my life!# Thank You AllMy journey wouldn’t be the same without YOU! Just like any social network your enjoyment is tied to the engagement you get from your followers so my time here would have been a lot less fun if it wasn’t for my followers supporting me. It took a second for me to realize but support on Steem comes in different formats. While you expect tons of comments on your writings or upvotes it doesn’t always come like that. Sometimes it’s a resteem but what I’ve come to appreciate more is the silent follower. The guy (or girl :) ) that reads your post but never leaves the comment or upvote then you start scrolling through posts and find that they actually reference your content or an idea you shared on their posts. That’s when it hits you that people are here but you don’t always see them.# Make Steem Your Home TooLike I’ve said Steem can be a magical place. You just have to find your space in the community to get started. Maybe you’re a long form writer and you’ve loved posting on Medium in the past. Then you’ll probably thoroughly enjoy the main Steemit interface. This isn’t always me. In fact I don’t know what I always enjoy to be honest. Sometimes I enjoy sharing a picture that grabbed my attention and sometimes I enjoy playing a video game with my followers. It turns out there’s a home for you on Steem in each of these instances. If you ever have a end up having a question about this place I’m more than happy to help you try to find the answer for it. Just leave me a comment and let me know what you need and I’ll do my best to help you find an answer.## Steem Is Full of dAppsWhile most people find Steemit.com to be interaction on the Steem blockchain, if you haven’t guessed already, there’s way more to it than that. All these other dApps are still saving your content and posts to the Steem blockchain but they may show content in a completely new, and sometimes wildly different, interface.### I Prefer More Basic Social Media Style Lifestyle - Busy.orgI bet you would like the guys over at Busy.org. Busy makes Steem much more graphically friendly and adds some features that just aren’t available on the main Steemit implementation. There’s a wide assortment of these features but some of the things I really appreciate is their refined interface as well as notifications based on interactions with you from other users.### I Love To Share Pictures With the World - SteepshotThen you probably appreciate Instagram when you’re not on the Steem chain right? What if I told you there was a site that was a lot like IG but was all based on the Steem chain and offered you rewards for sharing? That’s right Steepshot is probably going to be your new social media home. You can upload a picture right from your Android or iOS device and check out pictures from others across the globe by following the tags you appreciate most.### I Really Just Want to Watch A Video - DLive.tvYou must enjoy YouTube then huh? Well I have something way better for you now. It’s called DLive.tv and you can watch people stream live video shows or watch videos that others upload. Even better you may enjoy creating this content and now you have a home where you can earn some Steem for free by sharing your videos to one of the fastest growing dApps we have.### Social Funding - Fundition.ioDo you enjoy perusing Kickstarter for interesting ideas or GoFundMe for a cause you believe in and want to support. You’re going to really appreciate all the work that’s happening on Fundition.io! Fundition allows anyone in the world to post a project and receive support across the globe for any cause they want. This means you can not only support others but if you have a goal you need to achieve you might even find the means to do it here! Try it out!### I Just Want Track My Fitness - ActifitDo you love to run or track your activity? Then you’re going to want to jump in the Google Play Store and download Actifit! Not only will it do some basic activity tracking but you can earn Steem as well as Actifit tokens for sharing your efforts directly from the app. You’re already doing the activity why not make some money from it too? I’m All About The Jams - DSoundAre you a huge SoundCloud fan? Like to listening to independent music and podcasts? Then you’ll want to check out DSound.Audio. DSound allows anyone to upload their original music and earn rewards in Steem for their efforts. Not to mention you can find some incredible beats and shows that fellow Steemians have recorded. Show Me The Games - SteemGGThis is actually one of the newer platforms I’ve seen on Steem and I’ve been spending a lot of time here. Remember the old Flash gaming sites from a decade ago? Now HTML game devs can monetize their creations by posting them to SteemGG and gamers like me can enjoy some interesting creations! Be sure to check out Towner Defense and see if you can beat my 45 round high score! :) I Know All The Good Products! - SteemHuntAre you a big fan of finding the best deals on the internet? You will definitely want to visit SteemHunt so you can share them with your followers! It’s very similar to what you’ve probably come to expect from traditional sites like ProductHunt but now you can earn Steem just by sharing your knowledge. I’d Prefer To Just Share Links - dlikeAre you a Pinterest addict because you like to share the cool things you find on the internet? You’re going to appreciate dlike then! Simply drop the URL of your special article in their site and you’ll be on your way to earning Steem and dlike tokens for your efforts. It’s that easy! I Just Need Answers! - MusingThis is another platform that is new to me. It’s very similar to Quora where anyone can ask the community for answers and get crowd-sourced answers by other Steemians that might have more experience in that field. Not to mention it’s a way for you to also earn Steem! Be sure to give it a try at Musing.io I Need Better Healthcare - Air ClinicThis is by far one of the best things I’ve found to date to help people across the globe. Are you feeling a cold coming on or have another symptom that’s bothering you? You can earn Airtokens that you can trade in to speak with an actual medical professional through Air Clinic. They even have the ability to give a prescription for your ailment! This is a real game changer for anyone who’s unable to seek traditional healthcare but needs to speak with a doctor. Just Let Me Tweet Already! - ZapplI get it! Twitter’s 280 characters really let’s you get that quick message out to your audience in a way few platforms have been able to reproduce. The team behind Zappl is trying to do just that though with a modest 240 characters. It doesn’t matter if you’re mobile or on the web just drop a quick message in and now you’ll get the benefit of earning some Steem for your thoughts! I Enjoy Helping Others With Coding - Utopian.ioThis was one of the first outside the box dApps I came in contact with. Utopian.io is built to help spur development for FOSS (free and open source software) projects. After signing up you can submit your code adjustments to GitHub projects straight from the Utopian website. From here there’s a team of moderators who will review your revisions and reward you with Steem upvotes for helping contribute to the code on these projects. This is a true game changer and can now encourage developers to spend time on projects that help out society as a whole with actual value instead of just the feel good kind. As you can see there’s a lot more to this place than just the usual thought of Steemit.com and this is just the beginning. New dApps are being developed every day and it can become nearly impossible to keep up with them all. If I’ve left your Steem home out let me know in the comments! Until My Third BirthdayI just have to say thank you again! This place really wouldn’t be the same without each of you sharing your life and ideas with me. It’s not only gave me a great way to pass the time reading or watching but has broadened my horizon by 1000 levels. I truly enjoy reading your comments and can’t wait to see what this place looks like when I write my 3rd, 4th and 5th birthday messages.

They are a Canada based crypto company, that I first heard about on @LastWeekCrypto, which helps their customers easily buy and sell bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. They do this by offering virtual Bitcoin ATM software that allows customers to buy and sell cryptocurrency at 171,000 different retail locations. Now they are offering one lucky crypto the opportunity to be listed on their platform for FREE. If we as Steemians can be the top vote grabbers then that means you’ll be able to buy and sell STEEM at those same 171,000 locations in over 53 countries and across 6 continents. How You Can Help STEEM Be Listed 1.) Go to http://contest.gonetcoins.com 2.) Near the bottom of the page you’ll see different coins listed. If STEEM isn’t listed on the first page then use the search box that I’ve highlighted in yellow to search for STEEM. Once you locate Steem you put your email address in the box on the right side and click vote. Confirm your email address is correct then click on “Send Confirmation Email” 3.) You’ll receive an email from Go NetCoins asking you to confirm your vote. Simply click the link to confirm and your vote will be added to the list. 4.)

This means that you’ll be able to buy and sell your STEEM at 171,000 different retail locations! It would also ensure we have additional options for supply available.In case you missed my post from yesterday, I’ve attached the directions for it below. You can also find them on the original entry from yesterday.——————————————————————-How You Can Help STEEM Be Listed1.) Go to http://contest.gonetcoins.com2.) Near the bottom of the page you’ll see different coins listed. If STEEM isn’t listed on the first page then use the search box that I’ve highlighted in yellow to search for STEEM. Once you locate Steem you put your email address in the box on the right side and click vote. Confirm your email address is correct then click on “Send Confirmation Email” 3.) You’ll receive an email from Go NetCoins asking you to confirm your vote. Simply click the link to confirm and your vote will be added to the list. 4.)

This opens a great conversation about the benefits of saying you can only find our collective content through Steem. It also highlights the downfalls of walling yourself off. Unfortunately until you control a market you really can’t wall yourself off and survive so I’m happy to see that we’ll still be able to find FTG spreading the news about the best alternative social media site available on the world’s most popular short messaging platform.## Lost BenefitsOne of the biggest downfalls of not being available on other social platforms is that we are disconnected from users who have never participated in our community. This is why it’s so unsustainable for us to all start abandoning regular media is because as of right now we just don’t have the market power to pull others with us. We miss the chance to grow!Tonight I was streaming when I was introduced to @zayous. Zayous was tuning into one of my gaming streams on @dlive when he started talking with me. I always co-stream to @vimm (STEEM FTW!), Twitch (@Share2Steem BABY!), Mixer, DLive and Stream.me so @zayous begins to ask me about what all of the upvotes coming up on my stream meant. I give a basic explanation and tell him to get an account when I realized I still had claimed account tokens available. Thank you again to @pharesim for creating such an awesome tool in Steem Invite to make claiming token easy!This highlights all in the same weekend why we still need to be working hard to be social outside of our beautiful garden. Sure it’s better here and definitely a lot more rewarding but if we don’t go out and find others to share this place with then how much good are we really doing? So go forward now and be sure to give a quick follow to @zayous then think how you can bring someone new to Steem. It’d be awesome to grow large enough one day to make shutting off traditional media a sustainable thought!—##### Sponsored ( Powered by dclick ) ##### DCLICK: Introducing the Advertise featureLast week, the Advertise feature has opened. you can…This posting was written via dclick the Ads platform based on Steem Blockchain.

It’s essentially two units who are working together to create a synergistic flow between the two of them that is predictable and constructive. Unfortunately there’s times when one partner expects one thing but the other is expecting a different and it ends up causing confusion and sometimes a stubbed toe in the case of dance. Similarly if this happens too much then your partner, or customer, may find a new dancer to work with. Recently I’ve been working with a team who’s having severe operational issues and I’ve been brought in to alleviate some of those trouble spots. As I’ve now spent some time with this organization I’ve discovered they have a very customer centric attitude that often leads them to “go the extra mile” and do custom jobs. Unfortunately they’ve created so many custom jobs that there really isn’t a lot of standard operating procedures left. This is now leading them to the point where their custom work to make a customer happy is actually causing issues where they are under-performing because work is no longer properly flowing. Arbitrary numbers can become a huge business loss because they create uncertainty internally and externally. Why business owners don’t embrace standard operating procedures is beyond me! #business #share2steemI don’t believe that customer satisfaction is something that can be created in chaos. Instead my belief is that good customer service is created by the same characteristics of predictability and constructiveness that we find in a good dance partner. That’s why it bewilders me when business owners are willing to introduce inefficiencies, like custom arbitrary numbers, to alleviate smaller concerns that don’t affect core responsibilities and needs of their business.Instead I find that the better route is to become as robotic as possible with your business procedures. This allows your partner to know where your next move will be flowing and then your partner can make their own internal calls on how to meet you in the middle. This creates the synergy of two units working in harmony to create an overall work that outperforms when one unit is acting unpredictably regardless of their intentions.What do you think? Let me know in the comments if you prefer working with a business that would often go out of its way for you but could end up with a delayed or incomplete product or one that has defined roles between the two of you but delivers a consistent experience.Patrick Ulrich Posted from Twitter via Share2Steem This page is synchronized from the post: ‘Random Business Thought on Standard Procedures’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@patrickulrich/patrickulrich-1550512602259-random-business-thought-today/"},{"title":"Sunday Fortnite","text":"Sunday FortniteCategory: gamingSub-category: FortniteClick here to watch the live stream!Join me while I fool around on some different games from the Playstation 4.I’ll also be doing an giveaway for one @steembasicincome share.

This will merely be the wanderings of a bitcoin obsessed guy in America who wants to see the world improve. If you want to get an idea of some of the content I’ve produced in the past you may want to begin by checking out my Steem profile at steempeak.com/@patrickulrich. While this may or may not be what this site includes it’s where I’ve spent the last year for most social media ramblings. (Hint: I usually just spend time streaming me playing video games.)Now I’ve already mentioned two different crypto based projects in my first paragraph to this introduction. That warrants that I clarify this site is not intended to serve as financial advice. Please consult your financial adviser for any decisions you feel you must make. This site is not intended to be legal advice. Please consult with an attorney for matters that you feel warrant such advice. Finally this site may contain technical material but should not be considered technical instruction. I don’t want you to be looking at me when you lose tons of money following something I’ve posted to track for myself. I just want to track things I find interesting and hope you might find interesting too.While crypto is a large part of my life I’d be amiss if I didn’t quickly include my family in this post. While I’m not sure posts about my personal life will be the focus of this adventure I must let you know that a good portion of my attention is focused in this direction and primarily towards my wonderful wife Kati. This certainly helps shape my world view and thus the things I find and share.Tools For The SiteAs I mentioned before I’m very into crypto based projects and the two I primarily follow are Bitcoin and Steem. If you want to fully interact with this site then you’ll want to be prepared to start utilizing those. In fact I’ll be testing two tools for these networks in this first post. If you don’t know how to use these tools you might find me posting a recollection of my path to get them using sometime in the future. I’ll try to remember to come back here to update this with links if that day ever comes! :)The first tool I’ll be utilizing is an integration with SteemPress to publish my postings to the Steem blockchain. This ensures my content can be distributed to a network of individuals with the ability to reward the content via upvotes and thus allowing me to earn Steem tokens. This also means that even if my hosting provider decided to remove my website my writings that are synced there will still be available.I will also often include a message at the end of most posts hidden behind Lightning Publisher. To read these messages you’ll need to have a lightning enabled Bitcoin wallet to pay an invoice of a few Satoshis. In less crypto focused technology you can also subscribe to my mailing list on the site to receive updates as new posts go up or content is created. You can sign up for my mailing list here. Even with all of the new social media platforms that exist I still find that email is one of the best ways to stay connected.Thank youThank you for supporting this first post on my page. I look forward to spending more time on this project to create a hub to find me on the internet. I hope you’ll stick around and help me build this new cyber haven.As I mentioned before you can support more content by utilizing a Steem account (create one here) to upvote, play around with the Bitcoin Lightning network and leave a few Satoshis towards the post or you can become a patron by heading over to libre.patrickulrich.com. Most of all I’m happy just seeing you interacting with me so let me know what you think!—-As I promised here’s a first run of the lightning publisher. Hopefully you’re a Cincinnati Reds fan to appreciate this if you decide to support this post through lightning. To see the answer to this trivia question you’ll need a lightning wallet and 10 Satoshis.

It’s a new exchange that’s being built to support Steem and the multitude of tokens that will be coming online for our ecosystem in the coming years. If this team is able to fulfill their dreams then they may become a huge part of your Steem experience.In case you haven’t heard, tokenization has arrived on the Steem blockchain. With projects like Steem Engine delivering on their Smart Contract Tokens and Steemit Inc. eventually releasing Smart Media Tokens, soon anyone will be able to create a new coin or token. There will be a multitude of coins you’ll be able to earn by participating in this ecosystem with each holding it’s own market value. What becomes evident is that there will be a need for an exchange that can support all of these tokens for any of them to seed enough liquidity for support. This is where FreedomEx hopes they can stand in to provide a market that will allow the exchange of these multiple protocols along with more traditionally traded protocols like BTC, ERC-20 or TRX 10/20. This will even feature Steem as a primary trading pair against Taking things a step further for the Steem ecosystem, FreedomEx is also planning to help token creators move from alternative platforms once the SMT protocol is ready for release. This doesn’t end their lofty goals either. According to their announcement post, they will also be adding a fiat gateway in the coming months allowing new capital to flow directly into the ecosystem. Exchange TokenAnother part of the announcement they made yesterday was their own token called FREEX. Initially offered at a 1:1 trade rate with Steem, FREEX will be offered for sale on the FreedomEx website. The token is going to have a supply of 20,000,000 and will be the main trading pair for the exchange. Another touted feature for the FREEX token is their FREEX success share program which aims to allocate 75% of the platform’s trading fees back to the FREEX holders in the form of a daily calculation. In addition if you hold 1,500 FREEX by April 30, 2019 will be receiving lifetime free trades. Learn More TonightThe team will be doing a beta launch of the exchange tonight at 6pm CST. To celebrate this event they will also be live streaming a launch party that is going to be taking place over Discord, Vimm.tv, YouTube, Twitch and even the always questionable Facebook. If you have any questions they will be taking them in the form of an Ask Me Anything to help answer any questions the community might have.

I’m sure this bill was sold to the populace as a way to help stop the evil hackers. After all with the limited knowledge most lawmakers have about computer science it was probably easy to run towards authority. Instead of educating the public about proper web behaviors it’s much easier to just stamp something as BAD and try to eliminate it.—##### Sponsored ( Powered by dclick ) ##### SMT-Tokens Market Initiative in Daybit - Steemhunt, eSteem, Utopian, Actifit, Fundition, Tasteem, TrToday, we are thrilled to introduce our initiative t…—Unfortunately most times when you run to authority then you end up having issues like this. That’s because you have now asked the authority to begin arbitrarily reassigning natural behavior and they can only do so from their own point of view. Now you’re relying on their knowledge as the sole arbitrator of authority instead of the cumulative knowledge of society. With their limited point of view this person’s script kiddie code could be the same as the NSA’s strongest toolsIndividuals like this little girl aren’t the only victims with authoritarian laws like this. Society as a whole is now artificially limiting their knowledge. As a everyday citizen you take less effort learning about risks and instead rely on the authority to dictate where risks are coming from. When this is expounded over the majority of the population then it severely limits the culture’s shared reality to what is the equivalent of sheep.This made me think to myself, is there ever a time when we as a civilization should make sharing knowledge, or for that matter speech, illegal? As you can tell I would err towards no but I’m sure that some of you may have a differing opinion. If you do please let me know in the comments below what circumstance would find this acceptable.

I’ve invited many friends to join us here on the platform. It usually goes along the lines of “you’re already using social media why not get paid for it?” They will then respond with how awesome that concept is but how does the money come to me? I’ll then explain you get Steem but can convert it to BTC or eventually even just distribute it straight to cash. By this point I can already tell I’m on a losing battle.If there was a web store with items they would normally buy with fiat it would allow a new conversation to happen. Instead of explaining trading crypto I could say you head to Amazon and just spend it instead of spending cash. Unfortunately I don’t see Amazon making that change any time soon so we need small stores to fill that gap.Here’s my contribution towards filling that gap:https://www.shopsteem.comBy no means do I consider this a work of art. This is a minimal viable product in the complete sense of the words. It only has some products loaded (mostly gaming items), limited UI that needs a deal of work, products are too costly due to limited connections and we can only ship to US addresses at this point. That being said if you can get past those issues it should work!The store is based on WooCommerce and utilizes @sagescrub’s Steem payment tool. This tool enables anyone to deploy a store and accept payment without any third party vendor. I want to say a huge thank you to @sagescrub for their work on reviving this plugin. Originally created by @recrypto the plug stopped working after updates made it incompatible. I fooled around with the code and even asked others like @chansetheguy to have a look but was never able to get things working again. Thanks to this fine plugin stores like this are now possible again!While I’m a huge fan of Steem I love Bitcoin. The store also features a deployment of BTCPay’s payment server that allows us to accept bitcoin payments directly without relying on any third party processor. If you’re also a fan of Bitcoin we’ve deployed a Bitcoin Lightning node that you can also use to pay for items. Just remember to not be too #reckless!If you have suggestions for the site please let me know in the comments below. As I said before this is just a MVP but I want to make this into something much more. Your help with certainly make this reality! I’d also be interested in hearing what all you’d like to buy with Steem. This will help me focus on finding the right products we should focus on curating and bringing to the market!

I’ve long wanted to start making more video content but haven’t taken the time yet. That will certainly be changing soon!I got started by purchasing my VPS with Vultr.com. Vultr has a promotion that allows new users to spend $10 and then you get an additional $10 back. The goal was that I would hopefully determine IPFS use for me while I burned through the initial deposit and promotion. Unfortunately due to my switch to utilizing Square’s Cash App for purchases I didn’t have a card that would qualify for the bonus. Then I decided it’d be a good time to push the project off and wait until 3/4 of my initial deposit was burned. I can’t really complain too much about this because I had other things come up (like getting ShopSteem.com ready) so life moves on. I still wish I would have waited to deposit funds until I could put something on my traditional bank card. @bitcoinmeister would be disappointed by my haste.This was all until today when I sat down to watch Google’s Stadia announcement and it’s caused me to rethink how I want to distribute content. I had previously only wanted to use YouTube for posting my videos of The Steeming Pile and / or future crypto shows I’ve wanted to pursue. That was flipped upside down when I watched the live-stream announcing Stadia today. I think I’m going to be forced into making a change.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsaenNSjclYThe above is a recap of the hour long presentation for Stadia. There’s a lot of crazy things about Stadia that make me believe it will be the next major player in gaming but that’s for another post. There is one new feature that I think is a game changer for streamers though. It will be the ability to jump into a game with another user. This one feature is driving me to change my entire content distribution plan.Recently I’ve been streaming my content to Vimm.tv, Twitch, DLive, Mixer and Stream.me. As I alluded earlier I’ve wanted to keep YouTube for more professional content so I’ve been instead uploading streams of our weekly Steeming Pile there but leaving gaming content to not be stored.I’ve enjoyed my setup for streaming but things have seemed to stale over the last few months. Admittedly most of that is due to my own lack of desire for streaming but I think it’s because partly I was chasing a crowd that was never coming back my way. Instead I now find interest in building a new community around my content that is more focused on me and the content rather than my affiliation or disaffiliation to any certain platform. [@calimeatwagon preached this to me for months but I was being too stubborn to really listen in!]Now that I’m opening up my perspective I find myself seeking to make my central hub for my content stored around my own domain at patrickulrich.com. This will enable me to offer an easy way for followers to interact with me while still keeping a presence on other platforms. It also means that all of my content can still be stored on the Steem blockchain thanks to @steempress.With that in mind I started exploring how I would deliver video content. I’ve been wanting to integrate Periscope into my sites for some time to help grow my Twitter reach but it wasn’t until the Stadia announcement did I realize that I would have to be integrating YouTube into all of my options as well. This leads me to think my best option will be to make my primary streaming home a split between YouTube and Vimm while I also broadcast to Twitch, Periscope and either Mixer or DLive. One thing I have learned over the years is to not trust Google when it comes to a platform. If you’ve never heard that’s why I started using Steem so heavy in the first place. That’s why I decided it was time to get set up for IPFS so I could store my content on d.tube and never have to worry about it going anywhere since it would be redundantly stored on my server for protection.The setup for the IPFS was very simple. After using SSH to connect in to my VPS I just followed a guide from IPFS.io and away we went! Now I’ll be ready to pin any of my content as it ages on d.tube to ensure it’s available for as long as needed.

If you’ve not signed up yet this will make things really simple for you.What is ShopSteem?ShopSteem is a multi-vendor marketplace aimed at allowing anyone the opportunity to earn or spend Steem. Anyone will be able to create an account that allows them to buy from other vendors using STEEM, SBD, or Bitcoin. Additionally users will be able to apply to be a vendor and list their own products within the store and receive a payout in STEEM.Vendors are able to sell their virtual or physical goods and will receive STEEM in return. It’s my belief this will allow users a new way to earn STEEM and thus help to further expand the token’s distribution. Is ShopSteem Ready to Launch?This is by no means a final product and is in a working alpha state. Most features should be working fine but you may notice performance issues and broken links. I will continue working to ensure these are addressed but your reports will certainly help.You still have questions?

The really good news is that you won’t need to spend a lot of time coding. That’s because most of the work has already been done by @guix77. The bad news is that for some reason this is no longer working and I personally can’t find why. That’s where I’m hoping you’ll be able to step in to fix it! @guix77’s SolutionGuide - https://steemit.com/drupal/@guix77/do-you-want-steem-users-to-login-to-your-drupal-wordpress-or-other-php-siteUpdated Git - https://github.com/patrickulrich/wordpress-social-login/tree/steemconnect/ I’ve started a fork from @guix77’s original base with updated v2.steemconnect references converted to app.steemconnect. Each time I try to authenticate using the plugin I get taken to SteemConnect, which is good, but after signing there I’m taken back to the WordPress site and told that the authentication failed. I noticed that @guix77’s test site is also returning the same results so I’m assuming something in the plugin needs to be updated for SteemConnect. Rules of the Bounty You need to have a working demo or at least a working code base where I can build and test your working plugin. If any custom steps need to be made you’ll need to provide a brief guide to replicate those. I will tip 50 Steem from my wallet to the first person to provide a working solution for this. NotesIf you are confident that you can fix this but are in need of a fresh WordPress installation to test then please don’t hesitate to let me know. I will be happy to give you an admin account to upload your plugin to and be able to test if it will connect for you. Finally even if you don’t code or play with PHP/WordPress please resteem and share this post. The more eyes that are taking a shot at this will mean that much better chance of getting this fixed and bringing Steem to that many more websites and services.

For some reason it seems the addresses changed for how it could interact with SteemConnect so things stopped working properly. Fortunately @chansetheguy stepped up to find the solution for WordPress users everywhere!It turns out the recent merge for SteemConnect wasn’t everything that WP Social Login needed changed. Instead the plugin was still communicating with the wrong subdomain for the SteemConnect service. What chanse pointed out was that the following code needed to replace the former lines:// Provider api end-points$this-&gt;api-&gt;api_base_url = “https://steemconnect.com/api/“;$this-&gt;api-&gt;authorize_url = “https://v2.steemconnect.com/oauth2/authorize“;$this-&gt;api-&gt;token_url = “https://steemconnect.com/api/oauth2/token“;After a quick download from Github I gave the plugin a spin and it did indeed work! The site properly transferred off to SteemConnect, auth the keys and sends the user back to your Wordpress redirect. Perfection!How can I take this for a spin?First you’re going to need an installation of Wordpress to install it on to. You can find many sites that will host a Wordpress install but my personal favorite one-click installation is Vultr. Vultr has a current promotion where if you sign up and deposit $10 then you’ll get a $10 credit as well. Not a bad way to test this out for a few months since you can get by with a $5/month Wordpress blog account.After you’re all set and ready to go then you’ll want to head over to the project Github and download a copy of the plugin. I’ve not placed a PR to @guix77’s original project but you can find a working copy here:https://github.com/patrickulrich/wordpress-social-login/tree/steemconnectAfter that you’ll need to create a Steem OAuth app if you haven’t already. This is a pretty simple process and just requires a Steem account to manage the sign in. Once you have an account you’d like to use just head over to the link below and sign in with the new account’s keys to change profile type to app.https://app.steemconnect.com/sign/profile-update?type=appNow that you’re new account is set to be an app you need to define your apps settings. This is handled through SteemConnect as well so it won’t be hard to complete. Just head over to https://app.steemconnect.com/apps/@youraccount/edit and fill out the spaces on it. [Note: Replace “@youraccount” with the name of your new Steem app account!]This is the most technical part of the setup. You’ll need to install Node.js to be able to create a hash of a secret key for your app. Once you have Node installed you’ll want to create a new .json file called GENKEY.js. In this .json file paste the following code:const crypto = require(‘crypto’);const secret = ‘YOURSECRETKEY’;const secretHash = crypto.createHash(‘sha256’).update(secret).digest(‘hex’);console.log(‘Secret hash’, secretHash);Now replace ‘YOURSECRETKEY’ with what you want your apps new secret signing key to be. Save the file and open a command prompt to the folder you saved your .json file in and run “node GENKEY.js” in your command prompt. This will output a hash of your secret signing key.Now that you have your hash of the apps’ signing key it’s time to save that to the Steem blockchain. Using https://app.steemconnect.com/sign/profile-update?account=youraccount&amp;secret=hashofyoursecretkey you’ll replace ‘youraccount’ with the app account’s name and ‘hashofyoursecretkey’ with hash we just made from running GENKEY.Now you’re all set to boot up! Head into your Wordpress plugin manager and install the plugin that you downloaded above. Head into Settings &gt; WP Social Login and find the Steem logo on the right hand side of sites. This will add a new set of authorization to the bottom of the page. Fill in your user ID plus the ‘YOURSECRETKEY’ that your ran through GENKEY to create the hash and you’ll be all set.It was that simple!Big Thanks!I need to give a huge thank you to a lot of people for making this happen! First and foremost thank you to @guix77 for the initial project and @chansetheguy for bringing me the code needed to update. While the bounty was up I had a number of great Steemians check in and see what they thought might be causing issues. Each of your contributions helped put the pie together so thank you to each one of you that contributed an idea towards this. Finally thank you to @qwoyn &amp; @steempytutorials for creating guides that made this possible for me. Steempytutorials has an excellent guide for setting up this plugin. While qwoyn can be credited for creating a SteemConnect app guide that most of the above writing is based off of. This was a tremendous help in getting me setup and I thank you for the effort you put in!

Yeah, I’m talking about the international television and media empire that you can probably find by scrolling through your television cable package, RT. I almost didn’t believe it was true when @ericwilson first told me they were on Steem the other day.This was a momentous occasion in my opinion. Part of the original Steem whitepaper that stuck out to me was the idea that Steem Power’s value would be it’s holders ability to influence media. The often quoted example I believe off the top of my head was the Wall Street Journal. Regardless we are now entering in a period where an international publication is paying attention to our community.https://twitter.com/RT_com/status/1113508897732448256I immediately went to their page and followed. I then jumped over to @steemauto and add them as a Fanbase subscription. This is an opportunity to reward one of the biggest players in media for catering their content directly to our community and I couldn’t be happier to provide a portion of my .10 vote.A Little On SteemIf you aren’t familiar with Steem then this will seem crazy but I will actually be earning off supporting RT’s content on the Steem platform. That’s because each time they post, or anyone for that matter, 25% of each post’s payout value goes to the curators. By helping them I’m growing my own stake! Another part that you may not know about Steem is that it has a fancy way of combating spam. It uses the idea of Resource Credits to determine how many times a new user can interact with the blockchain. These credits are allotted in direct proportion to each user’s stake, or Steem Power, that they control. This ensures that accounts must “power up” Steem to repetitively post.While this may seem counter intuitive to a social network that would thrive most on social interactions between users it’s actually quite brilliant. This helps solve the problem of unknown user accounts repetitively spamming the Steem blockchain. It means that for someone to spam content onto the blockchain they must purchase enough Steem that they can convert into Steem Power for Resource Credits.If I haven’t lost you yet with my blockchain ramblings I’ll explain simply why I delegated some of my Steem Power holdings to RT.I WANT STEEM TO SUCCEED!As I mentioned before RT is one of, if not the biggest, media companies to come to the Steem blockchain. This is important since one of the blockchain’s core ideas was tokenizing media influence. The team behind @rt-international having a good experience is then of utmost importance to me.Part of explaining how Steem works was to introduce you to the concept of Resource Credits or RC. These power each person’s ability to access the Steem blockchain. In fact, it takes about 1M RC to make a single post. This means that it would take a decent bit of Steem to power their multiple news postings throughout the day.I checked @rt-international’s wallet this morning and realized this was literally a brand new account. They didn’t even have 20 SP yet. I was immediately concerned that they wouldn’t have enough SP so I checked their Steemd and sure enough they were without any SP to power any new posts.I have no way of telling if anyone tried to publish since their account’s RC depleted. I certainly hope not because I’d hate for this first major opportunity to be soured so easily. That’s why I have immediately delegated 50 SP to @rt-international’s Steem account. This should give them enough power to release more than enough posts each day until their first week of payouts come and they have enough self created SP to manage.Join Me!I thought it would be cool if this turned into a bit of a community effort. My hope would be that through a join support of @rt-international’s content that they will find the real value in distributing content through Steem. This will only mean good things for us all moving forward.You can help by engaging and upvoting content they publish that you find interesting or even adding more to their SP by delegating like I did. The more they are welcome the more likely they will be around is what I’d imagine. It’ll also force their competitors to look at the value they are getting from distributing here. Before long you may be able to read your favorite publication just by logging into Steem!

This was exciting because we need more ways of sharing important information that others may want to censor. https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/1117084264724455424How this has anything to do with BitcoinCash is beyond me but I guess he may as well tie that in while he can. Regardless the documents are really being hosted in the InterPlanetary File System or IPFS. Most Steemians will be familiar with IPFS since it’s used to store D.tube videos. While video storage is an excellent use of the IPFS protocol it’s storage can be used for far more than just videos. You can even host a full website from IPFS.I’d assume the main reason that @heimindanger chose this route for DTube is for it’s censorship resistance. Since IPFS acts as a peer 2 peer system it would be very hard to take down any content of value as it can be hosted on many different nodes that all interact with one another. This makes it a great place for storing DTube content that needs to avoid censorship but also a great place for storing public copies of some of government’s most coveted secrets.How You Can Support This EffortSince IPFS is essentially a big version of BitTorrent, it helps when there’s more peers available to find documents. This means when a document is called it doesn’t have to search through countless nodes to find something but instead may locate multiple nodes willing to give a portion of the documents up at the same time. This decreases the download time and also provides redundant support in case other nodes go offline.To help out you’ll want to run the IPFS software on a machine that has enough storage space available to store all of the documents. It doesn’t really matter what OS you run because there should be an IPFS package available for your software. This means that whatever you’re computer is running you can be helping to ensure that government oversteps are being available to be known. The best place to get started for this is from the IPFS documentation at https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/install/.After you get your IPFS server setup then you’ll want to download and pin the files. This allows your machine to store a copy on itself and let other peers know that it has the files available when they need them. For a quick guide you can read @deadalnix’s tweet which makes for an easy guide on doing this once you’re setup.https://twitter.com/deadalnix/status/1116735088325210113Want to really support Assange?Tell others what’s going on! I’ve talked with so few people who actually understand what Assange has done and has not done. The more we share with regular people the truth on Wikileaks and who the real bad guys are then the more we are really spreading Assange’s message and will be able to truly help him. It’s going to take a show of deep support to make Trump see that siding with the deep state will only lead to upset Americans willing to let someone else be our President.

Vimm Chat with TTS https://www.vimm.tv/overlays/chat/patrickulrich/?tts This is one of my favorites. When I first started streaming to DLive a year or so ago I really enjoyed when my chat would read via TTS so I could focus in on my game yet still be tied in with my audience. It also displays the chat in your stream so people can see the chat on replays and what not. To customize for yourself just change patrickulrich to your Steem username. Now just add as a browser source to your stream and you’ll be checking chat in no time. If you prefer to go without TTS just delete the /?tts off the end of your address and you’ll still get the onscreen display without the reading of comments. Vimm View Counter https://www.vimm.tv/overlays/vcount/patrickulrich This is what I use to keep the little counter in the lower left hand of my stream. It displays the Vimm logo with the current number of people watching you live. I think it’s an excellent way to showcase Vimm while also letting me know when new people are tuning in. To customize this for yourself just change patrickulrich to your Steem username. Now just add as a browser source to your stream and you’ll have a new view counter ready to go! Steem Upvote and Donation Alerts + More https://zygmunt.pro/apps/dcr/ This one is the gem of the group. @zygibo created a suite of tools for Steem based streams. This will allow you to have popups on upvotes and donations while also giving you a counter to showcase your number of Steem followers. Each one is different so if you only need the donation then you just set that one up. To customize for yourself follow the link above. On the site you’ll input your Steem account name and then any customization you want. From there just click ‘save settings and get OBS links’ and you’ll be greeted with a number of options to customize your stream. Streamlabs https://streamlabs.com Finally I have some tools I’ve set up from Streamlabs set up to monitor new Twitch donations and followers. I don’t really pay a lot of attention to Twitch but I figured these would be nice for anyone that did participate from one of those platforms. I’d still much prefer to bring everyone into Vimm over Twitch in the first place. Another Streamlab tool I plan to utilize soon is their custom widget for Sponsor Banners. If you know of any cool crypto projects seeking a sponsor please let me know! A Couple Tools I’m Dreaming Of I really want an OBS source that pops up on a BTC lightning donation. I think this would be a real game changer towards sites who’s monetization method is taking from their communities (ie DLive, Twitch, YouTube, etc.) I would love to see their faces when they see people using the backends while keeping 100% of what they are given. The other cool tool would be a lightning jukebox. Something where a user could place a YouTube link in and send a defined amount of BTC via lightning. When the payment processes their YouTube link is added to the playlist. I’ve seen that Blockstream has a c-lightning implementation but I’ve not been able to get it working. If you all know of any other tools like this I’m all ears!

I’ve been a huge fan of Vimm for a while now and have been collecting VIMM tokens from voting on streams. Yes you heard me right! You can start collecting VIMM tokens right now just by voting on active streams regardless of your Steem Power! Today I was watching @big-m play Fortnite when he had a few fantastic kills. The first that caught my eye was when he was riding a hoverboard and drove up on a guy and they started shooting shotguns at one another. @big-m narrowly escaped being shot to death (something like 5 HP left) but then drove around and finished the guy off! He went on to have quite a few more impressive kills so I wanted to showcase how awesome he was doing and figured what better way than by sending some native VIMM over! I’m impressed with how well it works despite not being supported for sending directly from the site. I just logged in to my Steem Keychain and found the token I needed and sent along a little message about how good he was doing in Fortnite. A few moments later my picture popped up above his chat with my donation amount plus the memo message I sent along! For being a pre-alpha (my words and not @chiren) this is pretty freaking awesome!

Kenn had started digging into what all you could do with @steemmonster’s new Dark Energy Crystals when he found the store. After making a Steem Engine trade, Kenn purchased some orbs and other potions to play around with. As always Kenn was way too gracious and sent me my first Essence Orb!I claimed the orb but for whatever reason my screenshot didn’t save properly so I don’t have a recap of what all came in the orb. Regardless I’m extremely thankful for Kenn’s gift and the time he spent showing me around the new DEC update.Tomorrow I’m going to stream a little Steem Monster action on @vimm myself! I’m hoping to finally get back into the swing of playing and start earning some dark energy crystals to power my account up more! If you have any suggestions before I get started please let me know!On a side note I’m really digging the value of Steem Engine and tokens on Steem in general. While I was excited coming into their release I’m finally really understanding the value they bring to community building. I can’t wait until everyone is tokenizing their communities. I’m becoming more and more bullish that this may end up occurring within the Steem ecosystem!Do you have any SE tokens yet?

I was impressed with the selection the vendors actually had with them. Everything from your traditional produce and starter plants but even some local BBQ sauces were out.Chigger Hill BBQ Sauce - 1 pintThe first vendor that we stopped at was a local BBQ sauce called Chigger Hill. We weren’t actually looking for any type of sauce like this but they guys who were out were super inviting an welcomed us over to their booth. After introducing ourselves they offered a bit of pork BBQ they had made. Unfortunately we were both still filled to the brim from our visit to Cracker Barrel so we asked if we could instead just get a bit of the sauce on a fork to try out the flavor. They had everything from mild, medium, hot and even an extra hot for flavoring. We started with a tasting of the medium but while it had lots of flavor it felt more like ketchup than anything with heat. We stepped it up to the hot and it was a bit more of our flavor. We probably should have tried some of the extra hot as well but didn’t want to keep making the guys bring out more for us to try. Kentucky Blackberry Jam - 4oz The next stop was at a local farmer’s stand where we seen some produce we wanted to get a better look at. After a brief greeting he showcased the produce he still had available. As he showcased the last bits I realized the corner had a selection of jams. I’m a huge fan of jam so this an easy decision. I quickly grabbed the blackberry jam while Kati looked over some of the strawberry jam.Some Type of Tomato lol The vendor described what kind of tomatoes he had and the kinds that were going to be available in the coming weeks. I hate to admit it but I was kind of tuned out for this part. I have 0 interest in tomatoes. I find them far too bitter and usually do my best to avoid them unless they are cooked to a point the bitterness is gone. My wife on the other hand could eat them like I would eat blackberries. While I don’t like to eat them I could certainly appreciate the aroma of these and made sure I grabbed a couple for Kati.Centerfield Eggs - Dozen Finally before heading out we stopped in another produce stand to look at some of their start plants. We had noticed earlier as we walked by they had a cooler of eggs so we figured why not grab a dozen to bring home. I had the opportunity to get the proprietor’s ear to ask if he knew much about bitcoin. He seemed to have heard of it but knew little and seemed to be sketched out a bit by it. I offered to help him adopt crypto into his offerings and he politely said he’d need to research more. After reading more about Centerfield Farms from their website. I think they would be very well served to join the Steem community. I’m hoping next weekend I can stop by for another dozen eggs and offer to help them get set up here. They operate a sustainable free-roam farm utilizing local feed to feed their animals. I would love to read more and help improve their reach. All in all it was a great little adventure out. We came home and immediately tried a bit of the jam and were blown away. I can’t wait to grab more of it next week. Hopefully I’ll get to report about new Steemians too. Who knows!

The problem has been that I wasn’t sure how all of my thoughts really aligned together. I know what brought me here and why that had value to me. What I haven’t been sure of is what the real value of the platform is and why I keep holding these tokens over things that I view as more valuable financially.If you didn’t already know I’ve long viewed that the only money that has true sound value is Bitcoin. I’m very confident in that fact. That being said I still find value in Steem’s ability to provide an uncensorable communication tool. This was especially true when Google+ dropped my collection on Bitcoin news that I had worked hard to build a very strong following on. Having a place where I could post whatever I wanted, about whatever I wanted, to a large community meant that I wouldn’t have to worry about sharing within a community who’s administrator could deny me access to.With that bit of background before us I want to use this time to brainstorm in my own mind what I see in Steem. I don’t want you to expect this to be financial advice or honestly even technology advice. It’s honestly probably not going to even come across as a very coherently written idea. It will however give me the means to see what I think my vision is and, hopefully, document why I arrive at that decision.Researching Other VisionsI like the idea of sharing ideas. When I look back at history I can often feel amazed at how quickly we’ve advanced as a civilization and I credit this, nearly directly, to opening communication lines. Sharing and validating others opinions and reasoning can help you merge their logic and find your own path towards truth with a better foundation than what you may have started with. That’s why before I decided to write out my own thoughts I wanted to sit down and read other Steemian’s visions. Note: Don’t take my excerpts of these great Steemians for any value or representation. Instead please check out each author’s vision for yourself and you’ll find much more insightful thoughts than I could attempt to pass along. These are just pieces that stood out to me and may have helped shape my Steem vision.Since @justineh started this trend I figured it’d be best to begin by viewing her opinion and seeing where the base format for this post derived from. After reviewing I really liked how she referenced that Steem can be a place for crypto newbs to come. I share this mentality and it actually is a key reason why I don’t like the idea of removing any content rewards from the inflation pool. Distributing to the same pool of content producers allows everyone to compete for the same dilution.I then jumped over to @exyle’s D.Tube video about his vision. I often find a lot of his thoughts insightful and appreciate his content. He talked about how Steem enables multiple visions within it and that it all comes tied back to being stored to your one account. You get all of the benefits of everyone’s vision but you don’t necessarily have to be tied into their services or community.This seemed to be echoed in a part of @whatsup post when she talked about Steem’s diversity of apps for varying levels of content. More importantly she hit on a key fundamental for me that the platform is open and that anyone can participate.@theycallmedan also hit on the idea of Steem being an immutable home-base. Sure you could create your own content home-base by running your own website but there’s a value in connecting your home to the wider neighborhood. This was the whole idea behind web 2.0 and why connecting together enabled a higher participation than interacting on single websites.I really appreciated @paulag’s viewpoint towards Steem as a tool for enterprise. I really liked the classification outlining Steem as an intangible asset. It was an excellent written piece.What is Steem?While I found value initially as a communication tool there is much more to Steem than just finding a way to send out your content. Steem is the foundation for the world’s best public information distribution systems that currently exists. This is because Steem incentivizes user interaction through the distribution of tokens to users who provide valuable information for the network. These tokens are what powers the user’s resources to interact with the network but also their influence towards the communities their tokens represent. This means that power is constantly being diluted and thus encourages them to continue to provide as much valuable information to their communities as possible.While this information initially was focused around content it has recently changed to data as well. This makes Steem a direct competitor to other data processing networks like Ethereum or EOS despite having a different data processing technique that relies less on trustlessness and more on distributed systems. This means that, to me, Steem is actually on it’s way to not only being one of the best public information distribution systems but also one of the best systems for organizing computational systems that is available.I think that Steem has been on this new path for a while now though I would argue that the introduction of Hardfork 20 is what finally made it a viable option to say that it is no longer just about content. The reason I give HF20 so much credit is for it’s introduction of Resource Credits. If you’re not familiar, RC allow for allocating network resources in the form of a standardized value derived from your Steem Power. This gave Steem a governance model that allowed for charging for allocating resources based on their computational costs.My Steem VisionI view Steem as a cooperative business built not atop contracts and business law but rather through the use of computational value. We are each earning shares of the business (Steem) based upon existing vested shareholders (Steem Power) determination of our contribution to the network. The amazing part is that anyone can join the coop and begin contributing and thus earning a portion of the company in return!The goal of this coop is to bring information into it and organize that information for the entire world to be able to access regardless of membership to our coop. Think Google but utilizing direct shareholder voting for all business decisions on what company projects are rewarded with our newest levels of growth (inflationary rewards pool) instead of electing business executives to operate the business.We aim to achieve this vision by splitting information into different communities. These communities may be simply a community tag such as /art or a more curated community information source through tokenization models that determine that particular community’s structure for processing information.Regardless of organizational structure, all of this information is then stored in an immutable ledger that is open for the entire world to access and process in their own preferred method. We replace the concept of trusted oracles for information with distributed data provided by mass consensus.That’s where my vision leads. I view Steem’s value proposition as providing a network where anyone can share events of their lives and contribute towards an overall consensus of the world’s events. This can then be applied to each post creating a massive knowledge graph that can act to serve as oracle from events across the globe. What it means to be an oracleThis application will be far more valuable than anyone could dare understand when smart contracts are running the world yet need trusted sources of data as inputs. We have a system that can track trust over the life of an account’s growth meaning that accounts that have spent years providing valuable, trusted information will be able to serve information in return for value.Imagine being the most trusted Los Angeles Lakers fan and being teamed with other trusted fans to record scores. Anyone wishing to wager will value your community’s approval of the scoring events. They would be wise to agree to a consensus of the top fans earning a portion of the pot of their wager in return for bringing a consensus to the actual event.While I used sports as an easy example it could be far more than that. I could write example after example of where social consensus can be extremely valuable but that doesn’t mean that Steem is guaranteed to be successful. Instead we must focus on a vision of providing this goal and introduce tools that could better read this data.What is your vision for Steem?

CCN.com - https://www.ccn.com/ccn-is-shutting-down-after-googles-june-2019-core-updateThis news comes less than a week after Google’s YouTube property made waves for demonetizing a range of commentators. It’s beginning to seem like relying on the search giant for your content distribution is becoming a much riskier business.The announcement article went on to explore if this was a crackdown on crypto by Google and determined yes and no. While crypto has been heavily impacted the changes don’t seem to only affect crypto related blogs. Instead any alternative news and finance sites seem to be taking a hit while mainstream sources are picking up their gains.My Journey With GoogleI can relate to all of this. I had left most all social media to make my primary home Google+ shortly after it’s announcement in 2011. I’ve long been a Google fan boy and their focus on privacy was a huge win over the competing Facebook.It was a good move overall. I quickly started gathering a following of like-minded individuals and enjoyed sharing to a community that seemed to have great feedback.When Google+ decided to launch Collections as a way to revive the fledging network I was completely on-board. I quickly made my Bitcoin collection and off I went. Before long I was approaching 20K followers and then 50k. I was astonished how many people were following my writings. My growth continued on totaling over 130,000 followers before I encountered a huge setback. One morning I logged in to share some recent Bitcoin news to find my collection had been removed. I was cited as violating the networks user policy despite no explanation for how. I quickly appealed in their formal form and on as many Google forums as possible. It would take months before I would eventually make a connection who put in a good word to one of the Google+ leads to have my collection restored. My Solution Fortunately by the time they got around to clearing my collection I had long left for Steem. While I was never able to convert even a small portion of my following over to my Steem page I’m still happy with the move. I now have no worries about distribution drastically changing. Now I’m able to serve content to anyone interested through my own personal website. I then am able to share this out to Steem’s decentralized network using @steempress. This ensures that anyone seeking to follow my activities can find them here without even visiting my personal site. Not only does Steem assist with distribution but it also serves a strong function in the storage. While I’m able to maintain my personal website with near 100% uptime there may be a time when I share something that my hosting provider finds unsuitable. Even if they decide to take down my site I can still count on Steem to store the communication without regard to what I said in it. I look forward to new social services arising that offer functionality similar to Steem. When those come out I will be utilizing them but until then and beyond I will be happy knowing that Steem is serving it’s function in my life and helping keep my voice alive!

She had been suffering from a cold for the week prior but that led to her body going into DKA (diabetic ketone acidosis) or essentially her blood turns acidic and slowly burns away at your insides.While this is a very dangerous situation to be in it’s not the hardest thing to treat. The first thing you have to do is make sure a patient’s blood sugar is not going crazy. Then you need to supply IV liquids to a point where you can flush out the blood. This can be much worse, like Kati’s spell this time, where you need to treat other symptoms but the root cause isn’t the hardest thing to treat.The problem is that you still need a doctor to issue a prescription to get the IV fluids. IV FLUIDS! To be allowed to even purchase these packets of water you are required to see a doctor. In the land of the free I’m not free enough to give myself water? Preposterous!We are constantly hearing about our struggle for medical reform in America. The problem is they aren’t even talking about medical reform. Instead were only discussing how things are paid for. How about we allow for individual freedom to treat ourselves and create real competition for the medical cabal? That seems like that would do a lot more to drive down prices than finding better ways to guarantee there is more money.Sure maybe you could make the argument that someone could hurt themselves when trying to find a vein. That being said isn’t this the land of the free where we can do to ourselves as we please? We go up in arms when the state won’t recognize a marriage we’d like but when it comes to being allowed to do things for ourselves (which marriage should also be done outside of the government but that is for later) we are so happy to cower over and let the powers that be control us!This isn’t even me getting started on insulin. My wife is a type 1 diabetic and requires insulin be administered multiple times a day. This has been her life since she was 4 years old. Despite having 25 years of experience administering her own insulin (far more than a newbie doctor) she can’t go to the store to pick up her insulin. No she has to beg the mercy of the medical cabal to give her the life sustaining insulin she needs. What if you had to go to get a prescription to have a glass of water? That’s her life every day.Thank you for letting me get this rant out. If you’ve stuck around then please drop a comment below and let me know your thoughts on prescriptions and the medical field in general. I’d love to hear a good argument for why this actually exists in the first place other than enriching the establishment.

I had lots of issues with the coverage and decided to write this piece to highlight what I felt wasn’t properly explained about Steem. Mind you I’m just sharing thoughts so I apologize in advance for the poor formatting and explanation! :)Let me start this article by thanking BNC for covering Steem as a topic. This is in no means to discredit their efforts on reporting about Steem. Instead this is a hope to spread awareness on what Steem has become and the progress we’ve made from years past.Before you get started you’ll probably want to read Aditya Das‘s piece over at BNC’s website called STEEM Price Analysis: Engine in need of a restart. It’s by no means biased and does a good job of highlighting a general picture of Steem. That being said there was plenty of room for improvement and hopefully this will help in that realm in the future.Note: I will share screenshots of BNC’s original article below. You can find the original copy of this at the link above.This piece actually originated from a discussion I started about the article on Twitter. After reading it I was triggered by the inclusion of DLive’s FUD and went to Twitter to call out BNC:https://twitter.com/patrick_ulrich/status/1138496775923339265This led to Aditya Das, @dascryptoforyou, reaching out to better understand what was missed in the article. I thanked Aditya for taking the time and offered to write this piece detailing any issues I had with the write up. Now that you have the backstory let’s get started…This was a pretty fair start to the article. I could nit pick that the actual platform of Steemit didn’t actually start until a few months after the blockchain started in March that would just be to include something to write about.Excuse my poor highlighting skills but this is where I found my first true issue with the analysis. Their statement is that the supply of Steem doubles each year is simply not true anymore. In December of 2016 the inflation was changed to 9.5% with a decrease of .5% every year following.The second portion of the highlighted trouble is that only 10% of Steem’s inflation is allocated for users who are creating or curating. This is also not true and is actually currently set at 75% for the two of them together. As I’ve mentioned before, Steem changes way too often for my own personal liking. There are currently lots of talks to change this distribution for a new inflation model that includes a worker proposal system, similar to Dash’s Masternode system, as well as other changes like a potential switch to 50% curation reward / 50% post author. As of now all of these changes are still speculative and no hard fork with code change have been proposed.This was actually the part that I led with on my Twitter response. Steem did originally have a 24 month power down cycle when I joined in July 2016. That has since changed with subsequent hard forks and now you currently are split in 13 weekly payments starting one week after your initial power down.This was actually one of the reasons I never invested in Steem back in 2016 and stuck with Google+ as my primary social platform. It felt like waiting that long was just to get people to lock in and then exit scam out so I kept my distance until Google+ decided it was time for me to make the move.This is just to hit a point of how often Steem is progressing and refining to meet market needs but we don’t actually have bandwidth now either. This was replaced with Resource Credits (RCs) in HF20. While very similar to bandwidth, RCs serve the means of tokenizing your available resources. While there doesn’t yet exist the ability to trade or monetize unused RC this is something that is still being developed.More importantly I wanted to start a discussion on SMTs. These are a very hot topic within the Steem ecosystem as the community has been waiting for their release for some time. The reason I highlighted this entire paragraph is because they don’t exist yet. It was promised they were months away from a release ages ago but never came. Reading the article I felt like the author was under the impression they were currently available. The unfortunately are not.While Steemit Inc’s lack of deliverance on this goal would normally be seen as a con, the Steem community has rose to the occasion with the release of Steem Engine. This platform is actually a second layer solution to Steem and enables most, if not all, the features that were touted to come with SMTs and a lot more. In fact Steem Engine is even in the works to add real world securities to their exchange for this second layer asset. Hint: This is a little scoop for any crypto authors who want a spicy write up! :)If you know me then you know this is the paragraph that triggered me. It would take too much to detail in this post but there exists tons of evidence to showcase that DLive had intentions of utilizing their own blockchain before ever publicly launching on Steem. While DLive is supposed to exist as a seperate entity from LINO, you can find find Steem blockchain posts where the LINO founder can be seen testing the code for DLive’s Steem application. I guess this is another post I should write up sometime to showcase.With the understanding that DLive was not without gain to trash Steem it is tough to take anything they said with any validity. I’ve long wanted to breakdown why their breakup letter was garbage excuses it might be time to plan that one soon too. Regardless even in what is said in the quoted text they are full of bologna. There were a number of “whales” who were supporting content creators like @fulltimegeek and @thejohalfiles to name a couple off the top of my head. They also didn’t just seek out people who were a part of a select group and helped vote for multiple new users. My wife was even gifted $100 SBD one night on a Steem DLive stream.I was excited to see the first highlighted article referenced. I’ve been exploring in my own head where I feel that Steem is improperly valued or just doesn’t serve a good purpose. I’ll look forward to reading this soon and detailing what I find.If the DLive portion was what could have pumped the fuel in me, this middle part was the spark to start my rocket. The author goes on to discuss Steem’s lack of centralized moderation and guaranteed free speech as a problem highlighting that child pornography has been posted by users. I have to feel this was included as part of a sensationalist push to spice up the reading but is half false and half the whole point of why were here.The Steem blockchain does not have child pornography stored on it. That’s because you can’t store child porn in plain text and Steem’s blockchain can only parse plain text. If we were discussing links to such content then I wouldn’t disagree but would instead point to the fact that every major blockchain has this. That’s because you can’t censor content on these chains because no one is in control. If you could then there is absolutely no reason to even have a blockchain in the first place.This was another part that partially triggered me. I had been a fan of Matt Sokol on Steem long before he decided to leave. When I read his Medium post I was blown away with how much didn’t make sense to me. This was later cleared up in my mind when I seen that Matt was moving exclusively to a new platform. It’s my opinion that Matt, like DLive, found a home where he felt he could make more and wanted to trash the old friend before joining his new friends. What isn’t pointed out in that article is that Matt has since left the platform he left Steem for and returned to Steem. I think that makes clear that his “problem” with the platform obviously wasn’t a big enough issue to stay away from Steem and his new home wasn’t nearly rewarding as Steem was for him.I guess this is a time to help shed light on vote bots on Steem. While you are correct that bots essentially let you pay them and in return they will vote on your post. This may sound like its just paying to get the highest payout but unless you’re familiar with the platform you probably miss key parts. That’s because attention within Steem, like most platforms, focus on what’s trending. Trending on Steem is aligned with a post’s value. When you take this view on you can see that vote bots are essentially a form of advertising. You are paying to move your post up in rankings in hope that more people see it and thus you reach a wider audience. I see nothing wrong with this and it definitely doesn’t affect the usability. If you don’t like this advertising model then there are sites that will tell you which posts are promoted so you can even see trending organically.Final point to make is that delegations, how you share your valuable Steem Power with these bots, only takes 5 days to resend. The 13 weeks is the length of time it takes to power down Steem Power back to liquid Steem.Technical Analysis and exchange reviewI don’t know jack about trading. I long realized that when I first started trading namecoin against Bitcoin on BTC-E ages ago. I quickly learned that my interest is in using these game changing technologies and not trying to make money by trading them. Because of this I don’t stand a chance to criticize or even share a positive idea about these sections. I hope you will read the OP yourself and tell me what you think about it’s synopsis of our market value.ConclusionI again want to thank @bravenewcoin for writing about Steem. If you follow crypto news then you’ll know that Steem doesn’t get equal coverage to other crypto platforms despite constant changes and news. The fact that Aditya covered us is worthy of our praise. I hope that by providing this review that future coverage can improve and may help to lead even more new users our way!One huge bright side that has come of me digging in deeper to write this was finding out that Brave New Coin is already on Steem! If you’re not already following them then I highly encourage you to pound that follow button! They’ve long been one of my favorite sites to read new Bitcoin related news and finding their content native on Steem has been a huge win. Go check them out at @bravenewcoin!

I had seen projects like Scorum exist and kept waiting for someone to step in to build a community here on Steem that’s sole focus was around the sporting world. That time never came for me until now. That’s why I’m happy to announce SportsTalk.social! #sportstalk is the new home for all conversations related to the sporting world. You may be a huge fan of the #NBA and want to talk about USAvsCanada or maybe you prefer to spend your summer months watching #MLB to look for the dingers. Regardless of your favorite pastime you’ll be welcomed here to discuss all of your favorite sports moments! SportsTalk.SocialSportsTalk.social is built as a second layer on top of the Steem blockchain. Using SCOTBOT from the Steem Engine team we are able to deliver SPORTS tokens to users based on a predefined set of community rules. These rules govern the entire system and will help to ensure that good content moves up the system. You’ll be able to sign in here using your Steem account. If you’d like you can sign in with your keys directly from the site but I recommend using Steem Keychain to better secure your keys. Keychain will also allow you to manage your SPORTS tokens directly from your browser. SPORTS TokenTo curate the content shown on SportsTalk.social we have created a Smart Contract Organizational Token (SCOT) called SPORTS. SPORTS tokens will be rewarded to posts within the #sportstalk tag in a similar fashion to way Steem works. The biggest difference is that rewards and influence on SportsTalk.social will be built around the SPORTS token. If you’re not familiar with Steem then the concept is still pretty simple to jump into. Each post written will have a 7 day period where users can vote on it’s value. As users vote the post’s value will go up or down based on the amount of SPORTS they have staked in their wallet and the consensus on the piece’s value. After 7 days of voting the resulting value will be paid out in a 50/50 split between the author and those who voted on the post. As users earn SPORTS they can then decide how they’ll want to use them. Some of the initial use cases will be to stake them in your account to increase yours or another users influence on future posts, promoting posts using our promoted posts tool or trading them with other users. SPORTS Initial DistributionThere are currently 100,000,000,000 SPORTS in circulation with a maximum supply of 1T. To seed the network, SCOTBOT will be paying rewards out of the initial issued coins with plans to make a switch to inflation based rewards in a future network upgrade. In addition to providing the initial seeding for the token’s distribution there will also be a distribution of SPORTS tokens to a number of different accounts with the aims of improving the reach and growth of the network. The first distribution will be supplying tokens to @sportspartners with the aims of sending SPORTS to early users. If you’d like to be one of the first users of the platform please leave a comment below. Initial Applied SCOTBOT SettingsIn the interest of a fair launch I want to provide all of the settings that were applied to our instance of SCOTBOT.
