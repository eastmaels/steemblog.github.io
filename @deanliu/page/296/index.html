Thank you. </p><br><p>Part 2 begins now. <em>Go pee before you read on</em>.</p><br><h2><strong>My Son Was An Agent</strong></h2><br><p>It happened almost three years ago.</p><br><p>It was a freezing night. I wasn&#x2019;t there when this happened and I blame myself for not being there to protect them, my beloved wife and son, from &#x2026; can&#x2019;t say no more, see for yourself. </p><br><p><a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/08/1111fab13.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/08/1111fab13.png</a></p><br><p><a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/08/22222aa57.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/08/22222aa57.png</a></p><br><p><a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/08/333380d71.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/08/333380d71.png</a></p><br><p>So now you know. I am agent Mulder&#x2019;s father. Don&#x2019;t tell anyone (that this guy is lunatic). </p><br><p>X-files had been so popular in Taiwan. My wife and I both love this TV series so much (and yes we do think Mulder and Scully should be together). As for why I did this&#x2026;    </p><br><p>It happened almost three years ago.  </p><br><p>It was a freezing night. I wasn&#x2019;t in the photo because I was busy taking pictures for my beloved wife and son when we were staying at <strong>Regent Taipei</strong> (for more on this hotel, see <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@deanliu/leslie-chow-from-hangover-is-in-a-hotel-room-next-door-to-me-live-from-taipei-taiwan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my lately report on Leslie CHOW</a>&#x2026; ). Regent had a giant light ball set up at the plaza in front of the hotel as a celebration of the Chinese Lantern Festival during the new year holidays. </p><br><p>We were all excited and Ethan especially as he probably saw such a big light ball for the first time in his life. Afterwards when I browse these pictures and I suddenly had an idea of combining them together to make an X-files prequel to amuse ourselves. <strong>Never thought that one day I will have the chance to show them to the world and in a fancy and meaningful way</strong>.</p><br><p>Lastly, apology for the low quality of the pictures. It&#x2019;s not easy to take good photos at night using my cheap cameras. But the story of agent Mulder is also kind of obsolete itself, isn&#x2019;t it? <em><strong>Love transcends time and low quality photos. </strong></em></p>

This was supposed to be in my diary. But since there is no such type of post (see <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@deanliu/post-should-have-different-properties-in-the-future-not-just-with-its-content-tagged" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my proposal on post types here</a>), I have to make it funnier (or&#x2026; <em><strong>more scary?!</strong></em>) so that it brings value to you. Here is the part 1.</p><br><h2><strong>Ethan&#x2019;s Killer Whale!</strong></h2><br><p>My wife and I took Ethan (my 3 years old son) to a department store yesterday (Sunday) and we let him take a roughly 1-hour &#x2018;course&#x2019; for modeling some cute figures with playdough (the store is the <a href="http://www.k-kingdom.com.tw/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">K-Kingdom</a> in case you visit Taipei next time with kids and this session costs about 30 US dollars). Ethan had finished two works with instructions from a young lady from the store. He was so intrigued and focused that he barely say anything so we the parents get to take a short break from babysitting - I stayed with him and read some good articles about bitcoins and his mother went for a little shopping. Everybody was happy. </p><br><p>Although the true value of Ethan&#x2019;s activity lies in creating optimized time allocation for everyone, his works symbolize this happy result. So, I am gonna share with you here one of his works - the killer whale!! (<em>No, I did not pick the whale by my steemwashed mind, </em><em>at least not from my consciousness level</em><em>.</em>) </p><br><p>Be prepared&#x2026;..  <strong>Ethan&#x2019;s Killer Whale</strong> is coming to get you!!</p><br><p><a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/08/hhh9d752.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/08/hhh9d752.png</a></p><br><p>I hope that you are not too scared by this intimadating picture. Actually, please refer to the wikipedia for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a scientific introduction on killer whales</a>.<em> Quote: &quot;Wild killer whales are not considered a threat to humans&quot;</em>&#x2026; And I especially like this one: &quot;<em><strong>Killer whales are highly social</strong></em>&quot;. So, please, enough about the mambo jambo about whales consuming all the resources. They won&#x2019;t hurt us&#x2026;.. or,&#x2026; hmm&#x2026; would they? whales, please upvote to show goodwill&#x2026; </p><br><p>Okay, back to Ethan&#x2019;s formidable creature. Personally I think it looks like another formidable creature from Japan TV/comics - the<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjOvth3O2Vs" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Ultraman</strong></a>!! whose creator also brings the montrous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkcfB3z0_-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>GODZILLA</strong></a>! You can see all the scaryness across them.</p><br><p><a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/08/vvvb40b2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/08/vvvb40b2.png</a></p><br><p>Too scary?! Please don&#x2019;t get mad. I come in peace. Don&#x2019;t want to scare anyone. Whales are peaceful (whales, please upvote to show goodwill&#x2026;). And&#x2026; the Ultraman&#x2026; if you know its translated Chinese name used in Taiwan actually means &quot;<strong>salty egg superman</strong>&quot; (the big eyes explains why), you probably won&#x2019;t be scared too much. </p><br><p>Again, apology if you think this post is suitable for kids and show it to them and they got scared. We don&#x2019;t have rating/censorship here at Steemit. It&#x2019;s partly not my fault.</p><br><p>Should you accept this apology. Please continue to check the counterpart post here:  <a href="https://steemit.com/cuisine/@deanliu/blah-blah-blah-on-ba-ba-father-s-day-part-2-dad-s-creation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Blah Blah Blah on Ba Ba Father&#x2019;s Day - Part 2 &#x2013; Dad&#x2019;s creation</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><br><p>Last, a photo showing where and how he made his creation. And no, I am not gonna show you the girlie playdough cake he made (he actually spent more time on this one).</p><br><p><img src="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/08/dddf2c3b.png" alt=""> </p>

            <p>Dear #photography steemians, here I am again. Previously I have shared three posts about Tokyo (<a href="https://steemit.com/cuisine/@deanliu/treat-of-tokyo-a-collection-of-cuisine-from-a-trip-in-2015-winter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Treat of Tokyo 1</a> and <a href="https://steemit.com/cuisine/@deanliu/treat-of-tokyo-2-a-collection-of-cuisine-see-what-the-city-can-offer-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Treat of Tokyo 2.</a> And then a <a href="https://steemit.com/photography/@deanliu/geometry-of-tokyo-a-collection-of-shapes-and-light-and-shadows-from-my-trip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geometry of Tokyo 1</a>.), and was so delighted to know that an amateur like me who just love to travel and take photos (with all my heart though!) can also have some positive feedbacks - maybe that&#x2019;s the SteemPower (which may become Steem Powers indeed lol)! </p><br><p>The sharing itself is good enough - after all, who would want to check out your photos if you did not show them in a decent art gallery? So I will keep doing this, digging, rummaging all my own photo files and select my favorites to share them here. Hope to see more feedback in replies, although upvotes are certainly appreciated.</p><br><p>Most of the photos were taken by my Sharp smartphone (&#x2018;smart&#x2019;, but really cheap. model SH837 which cost around 200 us dollars only 3 years ago. I am still using it). So, <em>average joe with below-average phone</em>, but these photos I think are still not too bad, huh? Of course, the scene is the key. Tokyo rocks!</p><br><p>There aren&#x2019;t many users from Japan. Previously I thought posts in Japanese use &quot;#jp&quot; but lately found out that maybe I should use #ja instead. So I change the tag in this post. </p><br><p><em><strong>Beauty transcends cultural boundaries, languages, and even space and time</strong></em>. Hopefully so does Steemit. Enjoy!</p><br><p><a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/07/IMG_20151104_2009542195f.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/07/IMG_20151104_2009542195f.jpg</a></p><br><p><a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/07/IMG_20151105_1239277951f.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/07/IMG_20151105_1239277951f.jpg</a></p><br><p>Above is the famous <strong>Tokyo Station</strong>  (&#x6771;&#x4EAC;&#x99C5;, <em>T&#x14D;ky&#x14D;</em>-eki).</p><br><p><a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/07/IMG_20151105_085609-16cf8e.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/07/IMG_20151105_085609-16cf8e.jpg</a></p><br><p><a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/07/IMG_20151104_092615484ba.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/07/IMG_20151104_092615484ba.jpg</a></p><br><p><a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/07/144688569939622ee6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/07/144688569939622ee6.jpg</a></p><br><p>The above three photos were taken inside the <strong>Tokyo Station Hotel</strong>.

The &#x2018;story&#x2019; is generally referred to as &#x2018;post&#x2019; here, and experienced Steemians know that you probably don&#x2019;t want to post more than 4 times within 24 hours so you won&#x2019;t be penalized by frequent posting. </p><br><p>Four posts, or even fewer, suffice if the author/creator seriously put his or her time into writing and/or crafting the posts everyday. Despite that we do see quite a variety of posts everyday, we have the &#x2018;tag&#x2019; system to help us categorize different kind of posts, by content mostly (like steemit, life, travel&#x2026;) and sometimes by others (like cn or kr for languages used). </p><br><p>But still, a post is just a post, not a message (so far only works while you send someone steem), not a &#x2026; well nothing else since there is no other vehicles to express anything (a reply is considered a post under a post). </p><br><p>Think about it. <strong>A &#x2018;tag&#x2019; is something you use to tell others what the content of this post is concerned. It is NOT used to reflect your, the author&#x2019;s, intention in composing this post</strong>. For example, we can have different kinds of &#x2018;posts&#x2019; in the future to reflect the author&#x2019;s purpose in using it. A possible taxonomy is:</p><br><ul><br>  <li><strong>Post</strong> - keep this original type to refer to most quality posts we have at the moment. it could be personal thoughts, ideas, experiences, stories, reports, photo demonstration, even academic papers that carry information with public value. This type is treated as how the system works right now.</li><br>  <li><strong>Draft </strong>- easily understood. a preparation towards Post. privacy should be allowed. no reward of course.</li><br>  <li><strong>Diary</strong> - a type that a Steemian can keep everyday or whenever he likes to himself (or go public if so chosen) that carries from murmuring, complaint, fantasy to self reflection. No need to be rewarded. Replies can be considered.</li><br>  <li><strong>Club Post</strong> - if we are going to enhance the community property @ Steemit then people will join different clubs and posts within the club can facilitate discussion but need not be rewarded steemwise. </li><br>  <li><strong>Others</strong> - free your imagination&#x2026; </li><br></ul><br><p>The reason I bring up this issue is because I saw so many new users, with no ill intentions, post like they are asking for directions on the road. Also, I feel a desperate need to write up but not to publish it, and I don&#x2019;t want to do it in a separate website/app/paper. <em><strong>I hope I can go everywhere and use any device to continue Steeming without worrying if I have put my beloved work elsewhere..</strong></em>.</p><br><p>  </p>

See the following example (select one with only words as pic doesn&#x2019;t matter): <em><strong>Top</strong></em>: my hello post to the #cn community in Chinese; <em><strong>Down</strong></em>: I use Word to re-edit the left one. </p><br><p><a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/03/compare9eb1e.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/03/compare9eb1e.png</a></p><br><p><a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/03/compare11c245.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/03/compare11c245.png</a></p><br><h2>What do you think? </h2><br><p>Personally I think the original one is really reader-unfriendly. And the second one is, after my not-at-all-professional 5-min editing, obviously better. I think my fellow Chinese friends here would agree with me (the case with simplified Chinese might be a little bit worse, but I am not 100% sure). </p><br><p>Maybe English readers can&#x2019;t really tell, but I assure you that there is definitely room for improvement. I have also checked posts in Japanese and Korean, but I think they are alright aesthetically. </p><br><p>So far, I think <strong>the only obvious problem right now is in Chinese posts</strong>. Users in any other languages are welcome to comment as well.</p><br><h2><strong>Why is this important?</strong></h2><br><p><em><strong>With good graphical design, good posts become great posts</strong></em>. I have read so many English posts that are on par with many quality online articles, in terms of content as well as art design.</p><br><p>If we are to embrace users from all over the planet. Except for translation (see my post here: <a href="https://steemit.com/translation/@deanliu/translation-and-how-we-tackle-it-affects-the-future-scenario-of-steeemit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Translation and how we tackle it affects the future scenario of steemit</a>.), we have to consider <em><strong>the aesthetic factor</strong></em> - the design of post editor, so that <em><strong>online personal publishing will become possible for EVERYONE in every languages</strong></em>. After all, human beings are visual creatures, even more so for potential Steemians.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p></p><h3>It&#x2019;s the man!</h3><p></p>
<p>This afternoon (of Aug 1st), I was given a chance to personally participate in a Steemian type D-live reporting as right now my family is having a small getaway-from-daily-life vacation in Taipei (also for celebrating my wife&#x2019;s birthday) and we came across this hilarious comedian in the hallway and later googled to confirm that it is him - <strong>the great CHOW the party king</strong> himself might live next door to us! (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaZihPC10I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the best of CHOW</a> video here)</p><br><p>According to the news, CHOW, actually the Korean American actor <a href="http://www.drken.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Ken Jeong</strong></a>, played the main role Louis Huang&#x2019;s younger brother Gene in the the second season finale of <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/fresh-off-the-boat" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><strong>Fresh Off the Boat</strong></em></a><em> </em>- a popular primetime comedy series that talks about the American life of a migrant family the Huangs from Taiwan.<em> </em>Season three is coming soon which will start with the Huangs on vacation in Taipei for Gene&#x2019;s (CHOW&#x2019;s) wedding. See the <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2016/07/fresh-off-the-boat-taiwan-season-three-premiere.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news</a> here.</p><br><p><a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/2016-08-014.36.116369a.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/2016-08-014.36.116369a.png</a></p><br><h3>Report from the spot</h3><br><p>The show is truly hilarious. We really love it. Yet still we don&#x2019;t want to interfere with whatever the cast (I suppose) are doing next door. From time to time, we can hear a lot of laughing and talking sometimes yelling from next door - <em>maybe they are having a party or maybe they are shooting? </em>Can&#x2019;t really tell and don&#x2019;t want to eavesdrop too much. Cannot divulge the room number to the audience either (don&#x2019;t have what it takes to be a parparazzi!). But still this is a D-live report post, I need to feed something to the audience here! So this is the window views of this hotel (<em>the ones from CHOW&#x2019;s room should be 98% similar</em>). Our room is standard but the one next door is ensuite and much bigger - we guess it might be their temporary headquarter.</p><br><p><a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/IMG_20160731_155547f51e2.md.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/IMG_20160731_155547f51e2.md.jpg</a></p><br><p><a href="https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/IMG_20160731_15553238787.md.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/IMG_20160731_15553238787.md.jpg</a></p><br><h3>About the hotel and its story</h3><br><p>Some may easily find out that the hotel is <strong>Regent Taipei</strong> (this information I think is ok) - a 5-start hotel run by a local hotel group Formosa International Hotels, the largest listed hotel operator in Taiwan. FIH acquired the Regent brand and <strong>Regent Hotels &amp; Resorts</strong> becomes a Taiwan-based international luxury hotel group. This hotel is a very popular choice among Japanese tourists (lately increasing tourists from mainland China) and many internatioanl celebrities also like to stay here when they visit Taiwan. In our a few staying experience with Regent in recent years, we had bumped into <strong>Tom Cruise</strong> and then <strong>Hamasaki Ayumi </strong>(&#x6FF1;&#x5D0E;&#x6B65;). And this time <strong>CHOW</strong>! Aren&#x2019;t we lucky?</p><br><p>Another well known story for Regent Taipei happened when <strong>Luc Besson</strong> chose Taipei and the Regent hotel and came here to film his <a href="http://lucymovie.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><strong>movie Lucy</strong></em></a><em><strong> </strong></em>starring <strong>Scarlett Johansson</strong>. It created a hype in Taiwan back then since it is rare for directors with international influence to take shots here. Of course, the sexy and charming star was also a huge factor in this. The interesting thing is that there is also a big Korean presence in this film including Korean gansters in the plot and Korean actors - Taiwan, Korea, Regent, and the entertainment industry. All here live @ Steemit.

And, warmest welcome to all Steemians to come to visit Taiwan. It was called <strong>Formosa</strong> (meaning beautiful island) by the Portuguese explorers in the 16th century.

All the contents are 100% genuine. The post is to reflect the fact that anyone here on Steemit can try to be a reporter. And my experience from this is: really excited but don&#x2019;t know how to strike the balance and writing news style is really hard.</em></p><br><p><em>And finally if you may, please say happy birthday to my wife in your reply. She is not happy about my &#x2018;reporting&#x2019; during her birthday! </em></p>
