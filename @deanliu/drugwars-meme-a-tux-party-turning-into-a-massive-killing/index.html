        <span>A spy sneaked into the house of another druglord. 24 other spies in tux were there. No body have weapons and 25 guys looked like gathering here to have a party. Yeah, the drugs there were not so much, but nothing could keep those professional intelligence workers from having fun and exchange their job info over some alcohol &#x2026; The spy returned safely. The spy&#x2019;s job was to get the info of the enemy so he did. Boss wasn&#x2019;t interested because there weren&#x2019;t any things to be looted. A female ninja heard and she decided to pay them a visit and kill those bastards. Oh, man, she was fast. Only 5 minutes she took to arrive and all 24 spies were still there. She mercilessly 5 of them. She wanted to kill all but couldn&#x2019;t, because there is a rule of &#x2018;5 rounds&#x2019; - damn it! She thought &#x2026; my attack power is enough to kill all in one strike!! She returned with dissatisfaction. She decided to strike again. Due to the limitation, she asked 3 more colleagues of hers to go together. Four ninjas, traveling fast like the wind, arrived again and in a split second wiped out the remaining 19 spies in tux, who were still mourning over their 5 dead coworkers &#x2026; Now they can have a party in hell. Four ninja girls returned to base with 600 weapon - they don&#x2019;t care about those, they just enjoy killing&#x2026; Especially, killing useless men.</span>
