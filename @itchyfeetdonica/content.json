I’m thrilled to be here to start my first post! Thanks to @joythewanderer , I was invited to Steemit earlier when traveling through Asia, and after some crazy busy days, I finally put my procrastination to an end to introduce myself! Let me begin with my Steemit logo sketches and the verification process (Yes I also drew a little kangaroo - I see these cute guys almost every day) ： Origins I was born and raised in China, studied/worked/lived in Asia, Europe, South America and the Caribbean, and now living in Queensland, Australia. Some friends asked me how I managed to survive in all these different languages and cultures?  The secret: Complaint less, appreciate more. Fear less, try more. My name is &amp;*^%(you won’t recognize it anyway if you don’t know Chinese characters), so I go by Donica, as it’s more definite than using Roman letters to mark the pronunciation of a Chinese name. Since I have been teaching Mandarin to non-native speakers for years, I would like to write a post about this confusion in Chinese names in future. So wait and see if you are interested (Hopefully this is not another excuse for procrastination I’ll try to use less emoji’s - my facial muscles are getting sore). I believe in a future decentralized and connected, including work, energy and…currency. That’s why I travel around to decentralize myself and to connect with the world ;). It’s also why I am optimistic about the #blockchain technology: if well regulated, it will disrupt financial services in a good way. I love creative and alternative ways of doing things, so #Steemit seems to be a great place to combine content creation and alternative currency, a cool crossover to help you get the best of both worlds. Yes I just like this ”cross-over” sort of thing, as a product of “cross-culture” myself. :D Interests (My Future Topics) My educational background includes a Bachelor in language and cross-culture communication and a Master of Cultural Studies, and my working experiences are in marketing communications, interpretation and translation between Mandarin and English, as well as language and inter-culture training. I’m most enthusiastic about traveling, photography, cooking, design, arts, crafts, sustainability, health and wellness. And of course in this ever-changing society you pick up new interests quite fast, such as #cryptocurrency =). It’s always exciting to expand the knowledge base and add new experience.I’ve traveled to over 60 countries across 6 continents and the journey continues. I feel exhilarated seeing anything with a map on it. I believe any traveler understands this wanderlust - you just can’t have enough. By traveling far and wide, you discover new ways of living and understand other cultures to appreciate them, you constantly get inspired and would ultimately better yourself. Especially when you travel solo, you set yourself free and interact more with locals. You start to judge less and accept more. I have loads of stories to share as a result of the extensive living and traveling in diverse cultures, and I’d like to do it from cross-culture perspective.Just like fellow travelers, I enjoy documenting experiences along the way. I love to catch the decisive moment in a photo, to tell a story with that captured scene, to freeze the timeless beauty in silence. I also tried aerial drone videos, underwater filming,…and have so much to learn. Here are some screenshots from my Instagram: a peek into my passion in travel and photography.I do, like many of you foodies there, take great pleasure in eating and cooking. And I try to learn cooking from different cultures during my travels, to spice up my own experiments on food fusion. I’d love to share these experiences in my future posts too, such as the fun culinary workshops in Mexico, Peru, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, etc..Drawing and painting have been my hobbies since childhood, and I started a T-shirt DIY painting studio and a comic club with my classmate back in university. For my startup work I designed some company branding materials and made amateurish websites and videos. Making crafts brings me immense joy as well. I’d be happy to share my experiences in making silver rings, batiks, etc… I surely have a long way to go as a beginner, and I believe it will be fun learning from all these creatives here on Steemit. Stay hungry, stay foolish. Consume less, create more.I will finish my introduction with some gifts made and wrapped by me: Merry Christmas in advance! =) Frown less, smile more!To Be ContinuedI can’t wait to be part of the Steemit community to share my stories and insights and to learn from you guys! Exchange makes change.Thank you for taking your time reading my introduction!In the topics I covered above, what do you want to read in future?

Here is my entry for the #landscapephotography challenge hosted by @juliank. I took this photo when hiking towards Cerro Fitz Roy mountain from the village El Chaltén in Argentina. It is one of my most unforgettable treks filled with epic views along the way. I love the color palette in the magic of beautiful fall foliage. Cerro/Monte Fitz Roy is also known as Cerro Chaltén. “Chaltén” means smoking mountain in the local language of the nomadic hunters in Patagonia. Since the peak is covered by clouds most of the time, the natives believed it was a volcano. El Chaltén is a charming village located in the Los Glaciares National Park, near the border between Argentina and Chile. It is surrounded by magnificent peaks and stunning glacial lakes. This location makes El Chaltén a popular base for hiking trails. So it is named Argentina’s Trekking Capital. I feel it’s a bit more quiet and peaceful hiking in this region than in the more well-known Torres del Paine national park in Chile.

Here is my entry for the #architecturalphotography challenge hosted by @juliank. I visited this unique church in the Limburg province of Belgium, before sunset on a crisp spring day, and stayed to capture its beautiful silhouette against the dimming sky. I once read about this see-through artwork from an architecture magazine, but when I came close to it, I was surprised by how it stood alone on an open field, in the middle of nowhere. Isn’t it a cool way to present art in public space? 这座独特的教堂位于比利时的林堡省。一个春日的傍晚，空气里漫着些许凉意，渐渐地，落日的余晖将纯净的天空染上了缤纷的色彩（我不是要开始写诗。。。只是介绍下这张照片的拍摄背景而已）。就在这一刻，我按下了相机快门，可惜，手有些抖。。。 好，下面开始正经的描述 ;p 我曾经在一本建筑杂志上看到过这个神奇的教堂，但见到实物的时候，还是有那么点吃惊。它就孤零零地站在一片空地上，周围空荡荡的什么也没有。 This platy guy consists of 30 tons of weathering steel, and has a poetic name : ‘Reading between the lines’. It is a collaboration between two young Belgian architects Pieterjan Gijs and Arnout Van Vaerenbergh, part of an art project by Z33 House for Contemporary Art in the city of Hasselt ( provincial capital of Limburg, a lovely place I should write about). 这个锈迹斑斑的大家伙由30吨耐候钢建成。插播解释：这类合金钢在室外曝露几年后能在表面形成一层比较致密的锈层，因而不需要涂油漆保护。以corrosion resistance(耐腐蚀) 和tensile strength(拉伸强度)缩写为商标名的COR-TEN最为知名，所以英文常以”Corten Steel”代称耐候钢。 林堡省会哈塞尔特市的当代艺术馆发起了一项公共空间艺术展项目，于是便有了这两位年轻建筑师合作的成果 — 透明教堂，取名为“Reading between the lines”。这个英文说法原表示从字里行（lines）间读出言外之意，而在这里lines也表示建筑中的线条-教堂纵横交错的钢板。 So why “reading between the lines”? Because you can have different interpretations. Depending on your perspective, this architecture can be a church, or dissolves into the landscape around it. (I have photos from other angles too, hmmm, another post required… ) Of course you can also see the whole thing as a huge page and read between the horizontal plates! ; ) How do you read it? Tell me in the comments if you feel imaginative today! =D 为什么叫这个名字呢？因为就像原说法要表达的“从字里行间读出言外之意”，这座有创意的教堂也给你很大的自由解读空间。这种特殊的钢板构造外观，结合周围的环境，在你眼前呈现的景观会随着你站的不同角度而发生变化。 怎么样？你对这座独特的建筑有什么个人解读呢？ 在下面的评论里告诉我吧！ The Magical Church - Reading Between the Lines Category Architecturalphotography SettingsISO 1600 38mm f/5 1/4CameraCanon EOS Kiss X3LensCanon EF-S 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USMLocationBorgloon - Belgium !steemitworldmap 50.806130 lat 5.343020 long Borgloon d3scr This page is synchronized from the post: ‘#4 Wednesday Architectural Photography - The Magical Church - Reading Between the Lines 解读比利时透明教堂’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@itchyfeetdonica/2-wednesday-architectural-photography-the-magical-church-reading-between-the-lines/"},{"title":"#5 Thursday Colorful Photography - Turkish Mosaic Lamps 土耳其马赛克玻璃灯","text":"Hey Steemians, Happy Thursday! Here is my entry for the #Colorfulphotography challenge hosted by @juliank. I took this photo on a street of Istanbul. In Turkey, these colorful mosaic lamps can be found in street shops, bazaars, restaurants, local homes… and are getting more and more popular in countries outside of Turkey. I’ve seen them in the restaurants in Europe, Asia, Latin America…and some people like to integrate these exotic oriental lamps with their home decor. 这张照片是我在伊斯坦布尔街头拍的。土耳其的街头小店，巴扎，食肆，宾馆，当地人家…… 随处可见这种色彩绚丽的马赛克玻璃灯。用这种灯作为装饰照明在其他国家也日渐流行开来。我就在欧洲亚洲拉美等不少国家的饭店里看到过这种灯饰，还有一些朋友喜欢将这些充满东方风情的灯饰用于家装以增添异国情调。 As you can see from the photo, Turkish mosaic lamps are made of colored and geometrical shaped glass pieces. These glasses are grouped to form different design patterns. In the center of most patterns, you see hexagram(star of David), a popular shape on Islamic and Arabic artifacts and mosques. The essential glass making techniques were perfected in the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire. While another trendy deco style - Moroccan lighting which takes their roots from Moorish and Moroccan cultures, is often confused with Turkish lamps. At first I also made the mistake thinking these lamps and Turkish lamps are from the same region, like some online shops titled Moroccan lamps but are actually selling Turkish lamps, vice versa. But, in fact, Moroccan lamps are mainly made of perforated metal, although they also come with exquisite design in geometrical forms. 如照片所示，土耳其马赛克灯罩上的几何图案是由彩色几何形状的碎片玻璃拼接成的。在这些设计里常常会有六角星，这种广泛用于伊斯兰和阿拉伯建筑及艺术品的图案。玻璃制造工艺在拜占庭和奥斯曼帝国时期达到顶峰。 还有另一种潮流灯饰则来自摩洛哥和摩尔文化。这些摩洛哥灯常常被和土耳其灯混为一谈，我在去土耳其旅行前也没太注意两种灯的区别，以为它们都来自同一地区。我还看到有些网店标题说卖土耳其灯饰，结果点进去一看其实是摩洛哥灯。摩洛哥灯虽然也有精美复杂的几何图案设计，但一般是由金属制成，镂空的图案和光影墙体相结合，创造出美妙的视觉效果。 Turkish Mosaic Lamps Category Colorfulphotography SettingsISO 1250 85mm f/5.6 1/100CameraCanon EOS Kiss X3LensCanon EF-S 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USMLocationIstanbul - Turkey !steemitworldmap 41.008238 lat 28.978359 long Istanbul d3scr This page is synchronized from the post: ‘#5 Thursday Colorful Photography - Turkish Mosaic Lamps 土耳其马赛克玻璃灯’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@itchyfeetdonica/5-thursday-colorful-photography-turkish-mosaic-lamps/"},{"title":"#6 Friday Street Photography - A Syrian Girl Feeding a Cat 喂猫的叙利亚女孩","text":"Hey Steemians, Happy Friday!

Here is my entry for the #smartphonephotography challenge hosted by @juliank. I shot this photo with my iphone4 on a hot air balloon ride above Cappadocia, a semi-arid region in Central Anatolia, Turkey, best known for its unique moon-like landscape and unusual rock formations. The formation of this strange landscape started during the third geological period, when three volcanoes located on the edges of this region began erupting frequently. Here you can also find underground cities, cave churches and houses carved in the rocks. I had to get up at 5am in the cold morning, but it was definitely an out of the world experience that I would never forget. The balloon was gently drifting over the fantastic landscapes, when the orange hued rays of sunrise kissed the fairy chimneys, orchards, vineyards, pigeon houses and cone-shaped rock formations. It was a marvel with dreamlike serenity. 这张照片是我在卡帕多奇亚上空坐热气球时用手机拍的。这是土耳其安纳托利亚中部的一块半干旱地区，以奇特的岩石构造、岩洞和半隐居人群的历史遗迹而闻名于世。地质学上的第三纪时期，这块地区边沿的三座火山开始频繁爆发，逐渐形成这里独特的地貌。由于与月球表面类似，这里也被称为“地球上最像月球的地方”。 虽然早上五点就得挣扎着起床，还冻个半死，但相比这场难忘的奇幻体验绝对值得！ 热气球载着我和其他几个乘客在空中缓缓飞行，太阳渐渐升起，柔和橙黄的光线给奇异的地貌镀上一层梦幻的暖色调。在这清晨的静谧之中， 神仙烟窗，圆锥形石柱、蘑菇状奇石，白鸽岩屋等大自然鬼斧神工下的超现实奇景在眼前徐徐伸展开来。 Hot Air Ballooning Cappadocia: An Otherwordly View Category smartphonephotography SettingsISO 80 4mm f/2.8 1/973CameraiPhone4Location Cappadocia - Turkey !steemitworldmap 38.643056 lat 34.828889 long Cappadocia d3scr This page is synchronized from the post: ‘#7 Saturday Smartphone Photography - Hot Air Ballooning: An Otherwordly View 奇幻热气球之旅’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@itchyfeetdonica/7-smartphone-photography-hot-air-ballooning-an-otherwordly-view/"},{"title":"#8 Sunday Golden Hour Photography - Sunset Between Dubai and Abu Dhabi 日落阿联酋","text":"Hey Steemians, Happy Sunday and Christmas Eve!

The second one is made of straw and is topped off with an Inca cross instead of a star. The last three trees are respectively created by stacking old chairs, shoes and rag dolls. 下面的五棵圣诞树是我在智利首都圣地亚哥老城区的中心武器广场拍的。第一棵是自行车轮搭建的。后四棵都装饰有颜色鲜艳的布料，满满的南美印第安风情。第二棵由稻草编成，顶上不是传统的星星装饰，而是印加十字架。后三棵树分别是用旧木椅，旧鞋和布娃娃堆叠起来的。 Sometimes simple is best.

I shot it when trekking in the region of Willkanuta mountain range (Cordillera Vilcanota) in the Andes, on the boundary between Cusco and Puno. 大家好！这张照片是我在秘鲁的Vilcanota山区徒步时拍的，这片安第斯山区位于古城库斯科和普诺交界处。 This amazing area has four major geological features: the Andean uplift, the hanging glaciers and glacial erosional valleys, the limestone forests, and the Permian formation with its singular colors: red, ochre, blue and turquoise. As these mountains are so colorful, many travelers call them “Rainbow Mountains”.  这块山区有四个主要地质特点：安第斯隆升，悬冰川和冰川侵蚀的山谷，石灰石林，还有造成这五颜六色地貌的二叠纪构造。红色，赭色，蓝色，绿松石色……因为这缤纷的色彩，外国游客常叫这些山彩虹山。 It’s a pretty tough trek to reach the peak of Vinicunca, also called Montaña de Siete Colores and Montaña de Colores, with a scary altitude of 5,200 meters above sea level. I had to get up at 3am and was picked up by a van in Cusco to drive to the starting point of the trek. After hours of hiking in the thin air (meaning difficult breathing and getting exhausted easily), being greeted by cold wind, scorching sun with crazily high UV, hail and rain (Yes these happened at the same time or alternated), I finally climbed (it’s almot real climbing) to the highest point in the afternoon and captured the view in the photo below. Shouldn’t you upvote for my efforts behind this colorful image?  要爬上海拔5200米的主峰七色山可不是件容易事儿。我半夜三点就得起床，坐上小巴从库斯科开去徒步起点。然后开始暴走，由于一路上空气稀薄，呼吸比较困难，容易因缺氧而乏力，再加上交替袭击的凛冽寒风，炎炎烈日（高原地区紫外线还很强），冰雹，暴雨，等下午我几乎手脚并用地爬到山顶时，已经是气喘吁吁，精疲力竭了。登顶后，我在寒冷的雾气中，用冻得瑟瑟发抖的手握稳相机，拍下了这张珍贵的照片（当然也还有几张其他角度的）。所以各位看官走过路过，千万不要错过为这得来不易的照片点赞啊！ Let alone the breathtaking view, another interesting part in this trek is the lovely llamas and alpacas, and the indeginous highlanders who herd them. I plan to post a series of photos to show these creatures and the natives (their traditional clothes are more colorful than the mountains), when I have access to my portable drive after this road trip. 除了这些壮美独特的山景，一路上还能看到可爱萌蠢的美洲驼羊驼，和衣着传统鲜艳服饰的印第安牧人。等我结束这次奔波, 会发些移动盘里他们的照片。（没错，我正在路上用手机码字发帖，敬业不？） As one of the few remaining pastoralist societies in the world, these herders use the high mountain trails to trade with agricultural communities at lower elevations. They also provide horseriding service to trekkers who couldn’t make it to the top, which saved lives of many I believe. I witnessed a few trekkers fainting due to the altitude sickness and harsh weather conditions. 这些土著印第安人是世界仅存为数不多的游牧部族之一，他们世世代代跋涉在这些高山小径上，跟海拔稍低地区的农民交易产品。他们也提供马匹给这里徒步的游客，由于前面提到的高海拔缺氧和严酷的天气，有不少人一开始就坐上了马背，直到最后登顶的山脚下。我还看到几个游客由于高原反应而晕厥，幸亏这些土著和马儿帮了他们一把。 Rainbow Mountains Category Colourfulphotography SettingsISO 100 46mm f/10 1/200Camera Canon Kiss X3 LensCanon EF-S 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USMLocation Vinicunca - Peru !steemitworldmap -13.790833 lat -71.232500 long Rainbow Mountains d3scr This page is synchronized from the post: ‘#10 Trekking in Rainbow Mountains in Peru  ⛰ 秘鲁七色山的故事’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@itchyfeetdonica/46lhgm/"},{"title":"#12 图说万州烤鱼 🐟 Szechuan Style Roast Fish Recipe and the Legend Behind It","text":"这些天一路自驾南下，昨天刚开到悉尼来看跨年的烟花。作为一枚吃货, 来到这个澳洲华人人口最多的地方，当然少不了来美食云集的唐人街大快朵颐，于是便有了下面这些烤鱼的照片。也在这里顺祝各位朋友新年快乐，年年有余！ 这家店菜单上写的是万州烤鱼，这种烤鱼发源于重庆地区，属于用料大胆，麻辣咸香的渝派菜系。 万州烤鱼和巫山烤鱼、诸葛烤鱼在全国各地，乃至世界范围内华人聚居的地方都占据餐饮江湖的一席之地，虽然不像闽粤口味的中餐馆那么普遍，却不时拯救着我等重口味吃货的味蕾。 烤鱼结合腌，烤，炖三种烹饪方法，又深得重庆火锅的用料精华。 眼前的长方铁盘中，鲜嫩焦香的鱼肉包裹着可口的蔬菜，沐浴在色泽红亮的辣汤中，浓郁的香料味儿和着热气，一丝丝地蒸腾而出。有没有看得食欲大增，食指大动啊？ 各位同胞食客可能也很熟悉点烤鱼的步骤了。 第一步：选择鱼类这家店的鱼是澳洲和新西兰本地鱼种，有鲈斑、玉鲈、盲槽、东星斑、黑石斑等选择。 第二步：选择风味这里有香辣、麻辣、剁椒、酸菜、蒜香，各分为微辣、中辣、重辣，还有酱香、蚝油、鸡汁等不辣的口味。 第三步：选择配菜有三澳元到五澳元一份的各种小菜可供选择。 那这么好吃的烤鱼是怎么来的呢？据传，晚清年间重庆有家叶姓名厨，叶家一位精通厨艺的女儿嫁入在清朝地方官员家中做大厨的韩家，于是她将自己掌握的娘家祖传炒菜秘方和韩家的烧烤调料巧妙地结合起来，先烤后炒再炖，成了最早的万州烤鱼雏形。 “先烤”是指把用料酒和盐稍加腌制的鱼放在铁夹中，用木炭小火烤到九成熟，期间刷两次油，再撒孜然粉微烤。当然我们平时在家没有炭火可以用烤箱代替，我以前尝试的时候220度烤了40分钟，炭火只要十来分钟，而且外焦里嫩的口感会更加到位。 “后炒”则是用葱、姜、蒜、鸡膏、豆豉等和牛油、红油炒出底料，再另起锅用五成热的植物油中火炒香干辣椒，干花椒和花生米，留待最末的时候淋在鱼上，撒上香菜点缀。 “再炖”也就是在底料里加上鲜汤煮开后下入各种蔬菜，用盐糖调味，最后盖上烤鱼。饭店里一般会将烤鱼和底汤盛在长方铁盘里，下方有酒精加热，以便食客便聊边吃。 在家的话我通常会省略“炖”的步骤，等腌制的鱼烤到五成熟时刷上炒好的底料，加入蔬菜，继续烤到九成熟，再把干椒料铺在烤鱼上一起烤至全熟。记得要包上锡纸，以免水分蒸发导致鱼肉和蔬菜烤得太干。 鱼和蔬菜营养不错，但是一般饭店里的口味会过油过咸，我自己尝试做的时候都会减少油盐用量。 我还好奇地上网搜索了一下万州烤鱼和巫山烤鱼的区别，只看到有人说万州烤鱼以清香口味为主，而巫山烤鱼以麻辣著称，但是各烤鱼店不管冠以哪种名称，一般都会包括清香和麻辣的选择，所以到底区别在哪里，我还是一头雾水。各位看官有谁知道的吗？欢迎留言评论哦！ !steemitworldmap -33.868820 lat 151.209296 long d3scr This page is synchronized from the post: ‘#12 图说万州烤鱼  Szechuan Style Roast Fish Recipe and the Legend Behind It’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@itchyfeetdonica/12-szechuan-style-roast-fish-recipe-and-the-legend-behind-it/"},{"title":"#11 Locals in Old Havana 哈瓦那老城区街头记忆","text":"Hey Steemians, My entry for #streetphotography this Friday is a photo I took on a street of Havana, Cuba.

I shot this photo 3 years ago with my iPhone4 at Groenplaats (green place) in Antwerp, Belgium, a lovely port city best known for its design and diamonds. (Sometimes ignored by tourists who only go to Brussels and Brugge,) Antwerp, as well as Gent and Leuven, are my favorite places in the Flemish part of Belgium, all with a strong artisanal heritage and cultural legacy. 各位周末好！这张照片是我3年前用手机在比利时安特卫普的Groenplaats（绿色广场）拍的。虽然在欧洲是挺有名的历史文化名城，安特卫普却常常被不少游客忽略。就像很多人到欧洲旅行会去南边的法国、北边的荷兰、东边的德国、西边的英国，却不会在比利时这个小国停留，就算勉强拨出几天路过比利时，一般也只会一日游去一下首都布鲁塞尔和水城布鲁日。而事实上，安特卫普和根特这两座北方弗莱芒的城市却是大有看头呢。 Groenplaats is a small square in the center of Antwerp’s historic district. It’s neither very green nor a square until 18th century. It was a cemetery next to the Cathedral of Our Lady, and it was converted into a square during the Austrian occupation. Today locals still call the square ‘green cemetery’. 绿色广场是安特卫普老城区中心的一个小广场。这里既没有很绿也曾经不是广场。18世纪之前，这儿其实是大教堂旁边的墓地。奥地利占领期间被改建为广场。但直到今天当地的人们还是沿用旧名，称呼它为“绿色墓地”。 It’s a popular place for tourists as well as locals to relax. On sunny summer days, I love to sit on the bench here reading a book, or to meet friends at the terrace of one of the cozy cafés bordering the square. You can also try the specialty beers and famous Belgian fries   (each of them is a national pride of Belgium, as well as the awesome chocolates, though most Belgians don’t have a national identity due to the complicated situation - this deserves another 100 posts at least, ; ) so I won’t ramble on here today). 这个广场四周有不少咖啡馆啤酒吧，又地处有名的天主教大教堂旁边，所以游客和当地人都很喜欢在这里休闲放松。如果你来这里玩，记得去试试比利时特产的啤酒和薯条。啤酒有几千种，薯条也绝对不是French fries（比利时人认为英语里的称呼法国薯条是个误会，其实是他们南部说法语的瓦隆人发明的），就像如果你说瑞士的巧克力是最好的，比利时人肯定跟你急。由于复杂的历史地理政治文化因素，比利时人并没有多少爱国情怀（如果继续展开，我还可以写很多怕打不住，这里就先到此为止），但有那么几样东西他们还是很引以为豪的。 夏天天气晴好的时候，我喜欢坐在广场的长凳上看看书，长凳旁边就有那种公益图书箱，里面的书籍供人随时取阅，只是多数是荷兰语书，看着太费力。也有法语书，同样不会省力多少。本来在既非母语又非英语的国家生活就不容易，如果再碰上比利时，瑞士，卢森堡之类的多语种小国，要么买块豆腐撞死，要么就在学习各种语言的深渊中苦苦挣扎吧，苦中作乐，也就能自得其乐了。 From the picture, behind the twinkling lights, you can see the bronze statue of the famous painter, Pieter Paul Rubens, who lived in Antwerp from 1587 until his death in 1640. Rubens is well-known for his dramatic Baroque paintings displayed all over the world. 扯得有点远了，回到照片中来：那些漂亮的灯饰后面有座鲁本斯的青铜塑像（睁大眼睛仔细看哦 - 老古董手机夜晚拍摄效果不好，只能隐约可见），这位著名画家的巴洛克名作遍布世界各地的教堂、画廊、博物馆，他从1587年开始居住在安特卫普，直到1640年去世。 The background in the picture is the Cathedral of Our Lady, a beautiful Roman Catholic cathedral whose tall bell tower can be seen from many corners of the city. 照片背景的罗马天主教圣母大教堂是安特卫普的地标之一，在全城的很多地方都能瞥见它高耸的钟楼尖顶。 If it’s a beautiful sunny day, it’s very pleasant to walk around the city, taking in the beauty of art and architecture, getting inspired in plenty of design and fashion shops, savoring the gastronomical delights… But if you happen to visit Antwerp during bad weather, it might be interesting to try the tourist tram starting from Groenplaats. The tram offers a ride along some of Antwerp’s most interesting sights. 安特卫普城市不大，步行可以到达主要景点，那些颇具特色的设计小店、博物馆、咖啡馆、二手古着店等也很适合闲逛。但是假如你来安特卫普玩的时候恰好赶上常见的阴雨天或严寒天气（西北欧也不会有酷暑天），可以考虑去绿色广场坐旅游电车，会一路把你送到市区各个有意思的景点。 呵呵，原本只是发张手机照片参加下摄影活动，没想到一个小广场也扯了这么多，看来是真爱啊。=) !steemitworldmap 51.217973 lat 4.402814 long Groenplaats Antwerp d3scr This page is synchronized from the post: ‘#17 Come Discover with Me the Beauty of Groenplaats in Antwerp  钻石城的绿色广场原来竟是座墓场？’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@itchyfeetdonica/17-come-discover-with-me-the-beauty-of-groenplaats/"},{"title":"#18 Angkor Wat at Sunrise 🇰🇭 日出吴哥窟","text":"I captured this moment of sunrise at Angkor Wat, Cambodia.

And according to the New South Wales Government, the market would move to a new complex on an adjacent site that is over twice the size of the current one. 除了海鲜烹饪学校，海鲜市场里还有渔港、海鲜批发市场、生鲜零售市场、海鲜熟食店、寿司吧等。每天还有针对悉尼海鲜零售商家的批发拍卖。新南威尔士州政府还计划将海鲜市场搬到临近的一块地皮，届时市场的面积会比现在的两倍还大。下面就来看看市场的照片吧： Visitors are enjoying the seafood feast at the indoor seatings and the outdoor promenade: 室内室外都有座位供食客大快朵颐： ☝️Have you ever tried this spiky urchin? It’s my first time seeing someone eating it in front of me. When I was snorkeling in the Caribbeans, there were a few times I almost stepped into the sea urchins, now it’s interesting to see they are eaten!I also saw them a couple of times in the markets in the Mediterranean, but I’ve never tried it yet. ;) 各位尝过海胆吗？这还是我第一次看到别人在我面前吃海胆呢。曾经在加勒比海浮潜时，有几次差点踩到那些海胆的刺。在南欧靠地中海的一些国家的海鲜市场也见过几次海胆待售，但还没有亲口尝试过，不知道味道怎么样呢。 We ordered grilled lobster tails, octopus and fish, with sweet potato chips and seafood fried rice: 我们点的烤龙虾尾、烤鱿鱼和椒盐鱼，配上红薯片和海鲜炒饭： Not only humans, an ibis and a pelican are also hunting for seafood:  不光是我们人类在吃，这朱鹭和鹈鹕也在觅食呢： So that’s it for today.

Today I’d love to share with you my visit to Pura Ulun Danu Beratan, this mythical water temple complex near Bedugul, in Bali,Indonesia. Its ethereal beauty has long attracted the gaze of admirers from around the globe. 大家周末好！这次我来和你们分享印尼的水神庙的几张照片和介绍。这一庙宇群在巴厘岛中北部的Bedugul附近，以独特的外形和缥缈的水上仙境般的周边景致而吸引着世界各地的游人前来观瞻。 Pura Bratan is built in 1633, located on the shores of beautiful Lake Bratan (Lake of Holy Mountain), a main source of irrigation in central Bali. This temple complex is used for offerings ceremony to the Balinese water, lake and river goddess Dewi Danu. You can see how important this temple complex is for Indonesian people, since it’s even featured in 50,000-rupiah (second to 100,000-rupiah) banknote of Indonesia. 水神庙建于1633年，坐落于美丽的圣山湖(布拉坦湖）岸。圣山湖是巴厘岛中部灌溉用水的主要源头。当地人在这些庙宇里祭祀巴厘岛水湖河女神Dewi Danu。庙宇群的身影还被印在印尼钞票五万卢比的背面（仅次于十万卢比的面额），可见它在印尼人民心目中的神圣地位。 Part of this temple complex, the 11-storey temple in the photos is dedicated to Shiva and his consort Parvathi. Buddha’s statue is also enshrined in this temple. 庙宇群中十一层高的主庙用来供奉印度教三大主神之一的湿婆（苦行/毁灭/再生之神）和他的配偶雪山女神。庙里的神龛中还珍藏着佛主的雕像。 Located 1200 m above sea level, this lake area is considerably colder than the lower regions on the island, which is a real bless when travellors get enough or too much heat in most other places. I felt so refreshed when I reached the lake in the late afternoon, from the sweltering South. The clouds and the colour of the sky were changing rapidly, and the breeze turned into a heavy blow in a few minutes, making ripples on the water. Shrouded in light mist and surrounded by lush greens, the temples looked truly enchanting at the water edge. 由于海拔一千两百多米，圣山湖及周边地区要比巴厘岛炎热的低海拔地区凉快不少，是颇受欢迎的避暑胜地。我从闷热的南边一路来到湖区这一块，凉爽的空气拂面，感觉非常舒服。在庙宇群间穿行，天空的色彩和云朵变幻无常，缓缓吹拂的轻风也迅速升级为强劲的狂风，在湖面掀起一片片涟漪。水神庙笼罩在薄雾之中，背靠青山，繁花掩映，绿树环抱，一派水上仙境般的迷人风光。 !steemitworldmap -8.271780 lat 115.166845 long Pura Beratan d3scr This page is synchronized from the post: ‘#24 Enchanting Water Temples in Bali  探秘巴厘岛水神庙’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@itchyfeetdonica/24-enchanting-water-temple-on-bali/"},{"title":"#26 Koalas in the Wild! 🐨 🇦🇺 跟我来看野生考拉","text":"I spotted these cute guys on Raymond Island in Victoria, Australia (where else in the wild can it be? ;p) 我在澳大利亚维多利亚州东部的雷蒙德岛近距离看到这些可爱的考拉（树袋熊/无尾熊）。以前只在动物园隔着屏障看到过，这还是第一次在它们生活的野生环境中见到。看它们悠然自在的样子，是不是很可爱？ If you want to reach Raymond Island, first go to Paynesville, the town where you can catch a ferry ⛴ over to the island. The ferry operates on a daily basis from 6:40am till after 11pm. You can take the ferry by foot or bicycle for free, or by car for $12. We parked our station wagon at Paynesville terminal (located on The Esplanade near Victoria Street), and caught the ferry by foot. It only took a few minutes to reach Raymond Island. Remember to bring some drinking water with you as there are no shops on Raymond Island. We didn’t know that and were almost dying from thirst strolling the hot and dry island. ;p 我们先来到Paynesville这个小镇，从这里每天有轮渡往返于雷蒙德岛。早上第一班6:40开始，每半小时到一小时一班，一直运营到晚上11点或更晚。步行和骑车免费，摩托车5澳元，汽车12澳元。我们把旅行车停靠在Paynesville的码头，步行上渡轮，短短几分钟就到了岛上。 上岛前记得带足饮用水，或者需要野餐的吃喝，因为岛上是没有小店的，我们当时忘记带水，结果在又热又干的岛上走了一圈，差点没渴死，最后奄奄一息地挪向码头，等到开过来的渡轮，那感觉，仿佛荒岛余生的人盼到了营救的船只 - 终于有了水源的希望！ On the island, there is a clearly marked 1.3km route of Koala Walk, but we soon strayed from it being distracted by the colorful birds, pretty residential houses surrounded by flowers, and 2 echidnas! Since koalas only eat Eucalyptus leaves, chances are big you spot them in a gum tree. It is a great experience to see them in their own habitat looking so natural and cozy. I also spotted a baby koala(joey) on his mother’s back high up in the tree, but I didn’t have a telephoto lens with me to get the close-up picture. The koalas were first introduced to this island in the 1950’s, and recently their overpopulation and lack of food have caused some deaths. So some koalas are being relocated, and there are volunteers working with the Koala and Wildlife center on the Island. 岛上有1.3公里考拉步行路线的标示，但是我们很快就不知道走到哪里去了，因为路边好多漂亮的民居，度假屋，老式房车，鲜花，色彩鲜艳的鹦鹉等各种鸟类，还先后看到两只针鼹鼠在觅食！ 考拉是只吃桉树叶的，所以睁大眼睛在桉树枝间仔细找，不难看到它们的身影。这次先后看到大约一打考拉，高高低低地，或坐或挂或睡在树上，慵懒惬意的样子，非常萌。我还看到一只考拉宝宝趴在妈妈背上，真是超级可爱，可惜在很高处，离得太远，没有长焦镜头，只能拍到两个小小的灰点。 雷蒙德岛上的考拉是上世纪50年代引进的，最近的数量激增和食物缺乏导致不少考拉死亡。所以有些考拉被转移到别处，岛上还成立了考拉和野生动物保护中心，也有志愿者帮助照顾这些可爱的小家伙。 Koalas sleep for around 18 hours a day, so this is a common sight: 考拉一天要睡上18个小时左右，所以下面这幅模样就挺常见啦： !steemitworldmap -37.922399 lat 147.728691 long Raymond Island d3scr This page is synchronized from the post: ‘#26 Koalas in the Wild!   跟我来看野生考拉’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@itchyfeetdonica/26-koalas-in-the-wild/"},{"title":"#27 World’s Oceans Tuesday - Irminger Sea Between Iceland and Greenland 🇮🇸 冰岛海域掠影","text":"This is Irminger Sea between Iceland and Greenland.

You might have heard of East African Rift Valley, and the Rift Valley lakes in Ethiopia are the northernmost of the African Rift Valley lakes. This group of lakes in the East African Rift runs north-south through the continent, from Ethiopia in the north to Malawi in the south. In central Ethiopia, the Great Rift Valley splits the Ethiopian highlands into northern and southern halves, and the lakes occupy the valley floor between the two highlands. This is a beautiful region surrounded by green rolling hills, and it’s full of banana plantations, pineapple plants, and mango and guava trees. The local people live a pastoral life, herding cows and growing fruits. Locals use these colorful tanks for carrying water. It was pretty hot when I was there, so I believe it’s not an easy job for the kids and women to carry the heavy water tanks in the scorching sun. The closest big town is Arba Minch. It’s known for its fish farms, and it also supplies fruits to the whole country. There is a university in this town which is well-known nationwide. The town is served by Arba Minch Airport. Some tourists fly directly here to travel in the south instead of first going to the capital city Addis Ababa. Arba Minch is a good base to explore the amazing Nechisar National Park, where zebras 煉 and gazelles roam the vast savannahs. 2 biggest Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes - Lake Abaya and Lake Chamo are also close by. I did a boat tour to these lakes and watched hippos, crocodiles and lots of water birds.

You may also get to meet the main characters from the show such as Popeye, Olive Oyl, Bluto and Wimpy. In some of the houses, you can find props used in the film’s production.

It has an abundance of culture as well as the natural splendour. I traveled alone there and felt very safe, the local people were friendly and helpful, and it’s relatively easy to get around as a result of the common English speaking. Besides, what the most vital for me is: the food there is tasty and healthy. 斯里兰卡是我最喜欢的旅行目的地之一。这里不仅有美不胜收的自然风光，也有悠久灿烂的历史文化。更关键的是：各种美食也是可口又健康。我在那里独自旅行了几周，觉得很安全，当地人大多是佛教徒，非常友好和善，而且由于它是前英国殖民地，英语普及，到处走起来也没有障碍。 When you visit Sri Lanka, taking the trains  is definitely something you shouldn’t miss. It’s an inexpensive way to get around, and the trains are going through some beautiful scenic area, packed with fun cultural experiences as well. 如果你去斯里兰卡，千万别错过乘火车旅行。火车不仅是当地人常用的便宜交通工具，沿途经过的地方也处处是美景。 看看一路上多彩的民居，门前嬉闹的孩童，熙熙攘攘的街市，漫山遍野翠绿的茶园中和乡间田野里劳作的人们。还可以跟旁边座位上的当地人交流交流，粗浅地了解一下别样的生活。或长或短的旅途中，就算你不主动说话，热情的南亚人民通常也会找你聊聊天的。 The initial railway system was built by the British in 1864, mainly to transport tea and coffee from the Tea Country to the capital port city Colombo, so that the produce can be shipped internationally. Today there are train tracks between major towns in Sri Lanka. 最初的列车系统是由英国殖民政府在1864年修建的，主要为了把山区产的茶叶和咖啡运往首都科伦坡的港口，再船运出去。如今，斯里兰卡的主要城镇之间也都有火车线路连接。 The coastal train ride from Colombo to Dutch colonial Galle is popular among tourists and locals alike. You can see the train rails in these photos I took at the Marine Drive, in the south of Colombo. The train in the first photo was probably going to Galle or somewhere in between along the coast. 从首都科伦坡开往南部海滨的荷兰殖民古城加勒的这条沿海火车线路很受游客欢迎。从这些照片里也可见一斑，一边是蔚蓝广阔的印度洋，一边是南亚风情的市井百态，还不时点缀着茂盛葱茏的热带植物，无敌海景配上摇曳多姿的棕榈树，看夕阳缓缓下落，还需要我继续安利吗？; ) 我这里发的照片都是在科伦坡市南郊的滨海道上拍的，第一张照片里的火车应该就是开往南部的某个地方。 I took the trains from Colombo to Kandy and up into Tea Country, stopped a few days at Nuwara Eliya, Ella and other small villages. Along the train journey, the views of the lush green tea plantations on rolling hills were simply breathtaking. I’d love to post more pictures and details of the train  journeys, and the interesting experiences of visiting local temples during a festival, the fun cooking lessons, etc., later when I have access to my laptop and portable drive.  So stay tuned and until next time! 我从科伦坡坐火车一路到了南部中央的坎迪，这个以佛牙寺著称的佛教圣地和文化古都。又继续上到盛产茶叶的山区，在处于斯里兰卡最高点的英伦风情小镇努沃勒埃利耶，还有景色和气候都很宜人的小山村埃拉停留了几天。一路上火车迤逦穿行于苍翠的群山，风光秀美的茶园风光尽收眼底。我在那些小山村里正好赶上宗教节日，跟着当地人去寺庙围观祭祀和发放免费斋饭，还去学了斯里兰卡美食烹饪。等我结束这次澳洲的自驾旅程，会整理一下电脑和移动盘里的照片，继续和大家分享。敬请期待哦！下次再见！ Have you ever been to Sri Lanka?

When I type this place name in my phone, this icon appears on the list. Right! It’s moai, the enigmatic giant stone figures created by the early Rapa Nui people. But of course there are much more than these monumental statues on this enchanting volcanic island. So I’m going to show you some fragments through my 9-day traveling on the island. Today let’s start from the introduction and Anakena, the cradle of Easter Island’s history and culture. Before I start talking about my experience on the island, I’d like to make clear first some concepts that puzzled me a bit before I traveled there. Hopefully it could be helpful to you too in understanding better the Polynesian and Rapa Nui cultures. There are three major cultural areas in the Pacific Ocean: Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia. As you can see from this picture I took in the Anthropology Museum on the island: Easter Island is at the southeastern vertice of the Polynesian Triangle in Oceania.  Around 500 BC, the first Polynesians set sail in their big canoes  on a colonization adventure. From Tonga, Samoa and other adjacent islands, they reached and populated the Cook Islands, Tahiti and other islands. After another 700 years, they sailed to different directions and closed the Polynesian Triangle by colonizing its three extremes: Hawai’i (Sandwich Islands) between 200 and 400 AD, Rapa Nui (Easter Island) between 800 and 1200 AD and Aotearoa (New Zealand) between 800 and 1000 AD. After the population phase on Easter Island, it came the classic era when the Rapa Nui culture reached its peak with the construction of the huge ceremonial centers and moai statues. Then at around 17th century, conflicts started between the different lineages. Moai were toppled and the Tangata Manu (birdman) ritual sprang up, until the arrival of Catholic missionaries in 1864. I’m lucky to have worked in Chile and traveled to Easter Island which was annexed by Chile in 1888. It’s a flight around 5 hours by LAN Airlines (now LATAM Airlines, the only operator flying from the South America continent) from Santiago to Hanga Roa, kind of the capital town, the settlement with most residents. You can also fly from Tahiti(less frequent flights), or take a more intrepid route - once a year, you’ve got the chance to sail the “tall ship” Soren Larsen to Easter Island from New Zealand. This great voyage takes 35 days, crossing the point on earth furthest from land. Sounds epic right? Just takes some time, courage and patience ;) The high season of tourism on Easter Island is normally from December to March, the warmest time on the island, and the coldest time in the Northern Hemisphere. In late January or early February, there’s the two-week long traditional festival Tapati Rapa Nui drawing crowds of tourists. On this annual event, the islanders showcase their skills and crafts in stone and woodcarvings, body-painting and cooking in the Polynesian style. We rent a motor scooter and roamed around the whole island for 9 days in August. You might think it’s too long to stay on a small island like this. But we explored almost all corners of it, and enjoyed it a lot during the off season when there were not many tourists. We even got upgraded to first class in the flight back to Santiago de Chile, because the airplane was almost empty. What a pleasant surprise to be served a little piece of succulent steak, paired with the fantastic Chilean wine! ; ) From the picture below(shot from my DK travel book of Chile), you can see that the overall shape of Easter Island is triangular. The main and only village Hanga Roa is located at the southwest. The photos in this post were all taken at the site number 5 - Playa(beach) Anakena.  Anakena has two ahus(ceremonial platforms); Ahu Ature Huki has a single moai(the giant monolithic stone statue), and Ahu Nau Nau has seven moai statues, two of which have deteriorated.  Anakena is the only tropical coral sand beach on the island that is good for swimming and sunbathing. The other beaches here are actually pretty rough, mostly with rocks, cliffs and strong waves. Surrounded by palm trees, it’s a great place to relax and to click some pretty shots. Anakena is known as “The Bay of The King”, named after the founding Rapa Nui king Hotu Matu’a who set foot on the island when it was first populated. This was where king Hotu Matu’a built his first house, and it remained the sacred land of the royal family. The single moai of Ahu Ature Huki is the first moai statue ever to be restored by Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl in 1956. The moai was raised by using only rocks, logs and rope. The logs were used as levers to lift the statue and rocks were put underneath, raising the statue little by little.  This whole vicinity in Anakena is a dense archeological site. It contains ceremonial centers both above and under the ground. So it’s of vital importance for understanding this mysterious island’s past. That’s it for my first post about Easter Island.

Today I’d like to show you an ultra cool interactive digital projection, a work by a Tokyo-based art collective and creative group - teamLab. I visited this magical space at the NGV (National Gallery of Victoria) Triennial in Melbourne a few days ago. The Triennial is a free exhibition of contemporary art and design practice, showcasing the work of over 100 artists and designers from 32 countries, running from December 15, 2017 until April 15, 2018. Spanning four floors, this exhibition explores cutting edge technologies, architecture, animation, performance, film, painting, drawing, fashion design, tapestry and sculpture. Used to be a student of Cultural Studies who had a course in art museum for a whole semester, I devoured this Triennial as an absolute feast.  There are so many amazing creative works, and every piece deserves a post! I’d love to show you a few more artworks in future posts. Now let’s start with this magical light show. Here’s the introduction on the wall which will explain it better than I would: This interactive projection reminds me of the work - Gleaming Lights of the Souls, by another well-known Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama (Yes I love polka dots too ;D ). I visited this permanent installation in the awesome Art Museum Louisiana in Denmark  in 2013. I will(should) write about it in a future post! (another cliffhanger ;p) I tried to upload a video of this light show online, but failed with my mobile data on a campsite (pretty bad connection). I’ll see if I can add it later. Using my phone to post these days is a real pain in the eyes if not in the neck or ass. ; ) Ok, that’s it for now. Hope you like this artwork as well as my post. Until next time!  中文概要： 这场酷炫奇幻的光影秀是东京的创意艺术团体teamLab的交互数码投影作品，是我前几天在墨尔本的维多利亚州国立美术馆三年展上看到的。进入一间昏暗的四面装有镜子的展室后，每次走动，传感器都会记录你的步伐，通过电脑传达给投影仪，再在地面上投射出漩涡，人的运动越快，漩涡也越激烈。如果人保持静止，漩涡也会消失。同时配有深沉舒缓的音乐，仿佛伴着天外之音在太空漫步。可惜我上传视频没有成功，没错，这些天一直是在路上用手机发文，现在又是荒郊野外没什么信号。 这件作品让我想起几年前在丹麦的路易斯安那艺术馆看到的长期装置艺术：“灵魂的闪光”，也是出自日本的艺术家，只是草间弥生更为知名。我很喜欢她那些波尔卡圆点主题的杰作。她在这次三年展上也有作品展出。哎呀，又扯远了。还是改天另贴继续扯好了。 这场免费的三年展占据了整个美术馆国际馆的四层楼，筛选了世界最佳艺术和设计作品, 包括前沿技术、建筑、动画、表演、电影、绘画、素描、时尚设计、挂毯和雕塑等, 展出来自32个国家的超过100位艺术家和设计师的杰作。从去年12月15日一直展出至2018年4月15日。 其中还包括两件中国艺术家的展品：徐震的15.8米长的大卧佛和小型古希腊罗马雕塑的神奇混搭, 以及知名时装设计师郭培最新的高级定制礼服作品。 以前读研时，有的课程一学期都是泡在艺术馆里授课，作为一名伪艺术爱好者，在旅途中碰上这样的三年展，还是免费， 真是一场感官盛宴啊。这些极具创意的作品，每一样都可以写一篇长帖，今天就让我先从这场奇幻的光影秀开始吧。如果有读者需要翻译上面黑墙白字的作品英文介绍，尽管留言告诉我。毕竟大家都很忙，也不一定感兴趣，暂且这样吧，呵呵…… 反正我写得很开心，希望你也有所收获。下次见！ !steemitworldmap -37.823430 lat 144.969642 long NGV Melbourne d3scr This page is synchronized from the post: ‘#30 A Magical Light Show of Vortices Created by Movement 酷炫奇幻的漩涡光影秀’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@itchyfeetdonica/30-a-magical-light-show-of-vortices-created-by-movement/"},{"title":"#33 The Exciting Drive at Gotthard Pass in Swiss Alps 🛤 🇨🇭 行驶在全球最长的隧道山口","text":"I captured this part of the Gotthard Pass during a road trip in Europe.

This region is located at north of Arequipa and south of Cusco. Chivay is the biggest town in the region. Deep in the mountains, the Inca traditions here are little altered. The locals still cultivate the pre-Inca stepped terraces built into the slopes. The natural scenery of this area is simply breathtaking (literally as well ;) - each time when you hike for any beautiful view, it takes your breath away due to the high elevation) - imagine the majestic high mountains shrouded in mist, the crystal clear creek flowing at the bottom of the deep canyons, and the condors soaring above your heads. When the sky is clear, you can also see the snow-capped volcanoes  in distance… I will show you the landscape photos in another post in future, today I’d like to share with you first the unique traditional clothing of the locals in Cabanaconde, a small village in Colca Canyon which I stayed a few days as a base to explore the surrounds. In Chivay, this bigger town, people’s clothes are more varied in style as a result of the mixed population. I will write about the market in Chivay in the coming days, where you would see people are wearing wider varieties of clothes. : ) I clicked this photo with my phone in a local bus from Peru’s second most populous city Arequipa to Cabanaconde. The lady in the photo got in the full bus somewhere on the way, and stood in front of my seat for the rest of her trip. In fact, the whole corridor of the bus was full of local passengers, some standing, others sitting on the floor. And even more people managed to get in: eager vendors who tried to sell all kinds of stuff - snacks, watches, herbs…; a passionate propagator who preached for hours without any break… It’s getting crowded, while it’s interesting to see all this drama unrolling in front of me. It felt like a real-life stage for a mix of magical shows - this is also the charm of South America. =) Ok, let me come back to the lady standing next to me: this is my first impression of the traditional clothing of the Colca Canyon people. The Canyon extends over a large area, so the clothing style is slightly different in different villages. As you can see, her vest is intricately embroidered, and her colorful hat has distinctive patterns on it. Later when I arrived at Cabanaconde(it’s a looooong hard journey delayed due to the flooded road - this sheer adventure deserves another post), aha, I found almost all elderly women wearing their traditional clothing - a pretty hat decorated with detailed embellishments, matched by the similarly patterned vest, with or without a piece of solid-colored fabric at the upper part, and a long, layered dress mostly in bright blue or red, with embroidered fringe. Gorgeous, isn’t it? At first, I thought their hats were soft and easy to fold up, until I tried one out in a small eatery in Cabanaconde. The owner family was also making the traditional hats, and the friendly owner let curious me try one hat on. The hat was actually pretty hard with a fixed shape, and it’s not so light as I imagined. In this high elevation area, the wide rim in front must have worked well in blocking some high UV rays. It’s interesting that it’s the man in this family who was making these traditional layered dresses. Like what I happened to see on a street in the village: I noticed younger women in the village don’t usually wear the traditional vest or dress, but the hat was still a common sight: That’s it for today’s post about the traditional clothing in Cabanaconde.

Seems the best moments happen when they are unplanned.  All content by @ItchyfeetDonica | 图文 by Donica 这篇不是什么干货攻略，随拍随想而已。=) 遥想当年，一周工作死磕六天，年假天数却寥寥无几，完全无法满足我那酷爱游走的心/脚(itchyfeet)。索性辞了职，砸锅卖铁，舍弃一切，怀揣所有积蓄飞去欧洲。 在比利时留学工作的时候，终于放飞自我，所有的空余时间都用来旅行，从冰岛和北欧四国到希腊马耳他，从葡萄牙西班牙到罗马尼亚和保加利亚（如果俄罗斯和土耳其也算的话），我马不停蹄，游历了几乎所有欧洲国家。 辞职去旅行，说走就走，是不是很狗血？有没有很励志？当然，那些类似走遍世界的说法其实都是鬼话，世界这么大，怎么可能走得遍？！; ) 我只是说”游历“欧洲列国，只有比利时和周边几国是深度游，其他只是蜻蜓点水，走马观花。比如下面这个要提到的地方，就只是待了几天而已。=) 一直觉得如果没有在一个地方长期住过，是很难深切体会到当地文化的，所以今天也就结合照片浅聊一下自己的旅行经历。 有这么一个处于欧洲大陆中间的小国，它的首都经常被赞为欧洲最美丽的城市。这就是有着“千塔之城”、“金色城市”等美称的捷克首都布拉格。是不是最美，每个人心里标准不同。但可以肯定的是，这是一座文化艺术底蕴极为深厚的古城，是一个值得你慢慢品味的地方。 这座城也是很多文艺作品灵感的源泉，有米兰·昆德拉的小说《生命中不能承受之轻》，有据此改编的老电影《情陷布拉格》，有斯美塔那的名曲《伏尔塔瓦河》，有周杰伦的流行曲《布拉格广场》，有徐静蕾的大作《有一个地方只有我们知道》，有韩剧《布拉格恋人》，还有无处不在的卡夫卡。 还记得《鼹鼠的故事》吗？这童年时期的捷克动画让我第一次知道了这个国家。是的，就是这只机灵可爱的小鼹鼠，而不是布拉格城堡，不是查理大桥，不是皮尔森啤酒，不是古典音乐，也不是爱因斯坦和卡夫卡。: ) Krteček The Mole - childhood memories: 可惜此刻的我并没有一颗科普的心，虽然曾经做过文化培训。所以下文不会出现咀嚼网络百科后反刍而来的各景点历史背景大放送，只是一点个人唠叨罢了。 题图和上面这张照片拍于穿城而过，美丽动人的伏尔塔瓦河西边某处高地。看到我和路人甲拍摄水平的差距了吗？哈哈。请求路人甲帮我拍的那张，上传前还裁掉前面一大截地面和左边一大块阴影，这也算是常独自旅行的小问题吧，懒得带脚架，请路人帮忙拍照要看造化，拍出一大片地面已经算不错了，有时候还会缺胳膊少腿啥的，给你弄个四肢不完整。 还有一个找路人甲拍照的缺点就是没有多大创作空间，只能直视镜头，僵硬地摆拍。试想一下，你对路人甲说：请等一下，盯着镜头微笑有点傻，容我拗个特别的诗意造型，这时他/她除了迷惑不解一脸懵还能怎么样？ 有一次在南欧的某桥上请过路人帮忙拍照，我想，这么美的景色，留个背影该多妙呀。于是把相机给可爱的路人甲，背转身去作深情凝望远方状， 5秒钟后，再次转过身来时，问他：拍完了？却只见路人甲终于端起相机开使拍照， 脸上带着“你终于转身过来我好拍照了” 的善意表情······此刻的你好意思让他重新端起相机再等5秒给你凹造型？ 于是，只好默默转向自拍。自拍时相机又需要借助各种外力，放垃圾桶上，挂树上，捆在栏杆上，身边有什么就用什么······ 可怜我那小佳能，忠心耿耿跟了我近十载，受尽各种委屈······ 好了，又扯远了，我刚说前面那两张照片拍于“某处”高地，是因为我也不清楚具体在哪，只是某天在沙发主家附近没有计划漫无目的地闲逛，偶然看到一处台阶，拾级而上，意外发现了这个制高点。然后，这经典的金色布拉格就意料之外地铺开在眼前。 虽然这种散漫的旅行风格和极度路痴的禀性让我错过了不少各国的著名景点，却常常有如神助地获得意外惊喜。有句话说得好：最好的事情总在没有计划的情况下发生，当然，最坏的可能也是这样。我没有用引号，是因为写着写着，我就感觉类似的原话经我的大脑一番搅和后已经被篡改，哈哈哈 ;)。其实，回想起来，旅行中很多难忘的经历通常不是在著名景点前留影，而往往发生在寻常巷陌，在土产市场，在搭便车的路途中，在当地人的厨房里······ 回到这座山头，你看，这传说中的金色布拉格 — 夕阳西下，绿顶黄墙红瓦，古堡街巷，缓缓流淌的母亲河伏尔塔瓦，通通被镀上一层金色的外衣。除了这美景，还有那美女，以及拍美景和美女的我们 — 四个素不相识却都端着相机拍照的人。  看出来是四个了吗？;D A photoshoot and 4 photographers: 说到美女，来布拉格之前就在鲁汶大学里认识了不少捷克来的学生，帅哥美女众多，这次来玩的几天，其中有天晚上正好有位之前认识的捷克小哥跟他女友领我在市区转了转，又见到各色帅哥美女若干。 在学校时跟这位捷克小哥是邻居，所以跟他和另外一名捷克女生常常一起下厨聚餐，总是相谈甚欢，结下深厚的友谊，; ) 到现在我还保留着一面他俩送我的捷克小国旗。记得当时印象最深的就是聊到捷克和波兰在二战中对德军侵略的态度，捷克人选择了不抵抗，布拉格老城因此得以完整保存，免受战火荼毒；而波兰人则殊死抵抗，华沙也成为二战中遭受破坏最为严重的城市之一。后来跟布拉格的沙发主聊起这段历史，他也是感慨不已。这让我想起老子的老师临终前留给他的诫训: 舌存以柔，齿亡以刚。似乎当年的捷克人也深谙此道。柔软的布拉格就像舌头，却得以长存；刚烈的华沙硬如牙齿，却在炮火中化为一片废墟。 还是来点轻松的，继续插播美女的话题 ;), 根据我游历欧洲列国的浅薄而又主观的判断，出产帅哥美女较多的国家地区有瑞典，波兰（主要是美女），克罗地亚， 葡萄牙中北部，意大利北部，西班牙的加泰罗尼亚，立陶宛，拉脱维亚，捷克和斯洛伐克。以上纯属个人意见，仅供参考，不构成撩妹/汉建议。也欢迎你留言告诉我你眼中盛产美人的地方，呵呵。说了是篇随想，所以插播了不少。 The Dancing House at the riverfront, designed by the Croatian-Czech architect Vlado Milunić and Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry, inspired by the iconic dance partners Fred and Ginger, completed in 1996: 伏尔塔瓦河岸边跳舞的房子： 好了，今天的图文分享就到这里。你去过千年古城布拉格吗？在那里有什么难忘的经历？如果没有去过，又是因为什么而听说这座城市的呢？ Have you been to Prague or Czech Republic? What did you do there? Krteček The Mole is the first thing I got to know about this amazing country, when I was a little girl watching the cartoon series ;) Surprisingly, for me it’s not the beers, the castles, the classical music, or the ubiquitous Franz Kafka.

This set of unique houses were designed by Dutch architect Piet Blom, who is one of the representatives of the movement Structuralism. In fact, Blom designed the first Cube Houses in Helmond(northeast of Eindhoven) in the mid-1970s. But these yellow houses built later in the early 1980s in Rotterdam are better known to the world. You can visit Piet Blom Museum in Hengelo, The Netherlands, if you are interested in knowing more about his works. 鹿特丹是荷兰仅次于首都阿姆斯特丹的第二大城市，也是欧洲最大的海港。不同于众多拥有中世纪古风建筑的欧洲城市，鹿特丹以标新立异的现代建筑而闻名。原本是座历史古城，但是二战的炮火几乎将其夷为平地，不同于严谨坚韧的德国人将科隆、德累斯顿等被炸毁的古城悉数复原，富有创意的荷兰人在片片废墟上立起了独特的新作。这里也诞生了不少知名的建筑设计师，比如北京CCTV的新楼“大裤衩” 就是由来自鹿特丹的设计师然·考哈斯(Rem Koolhass)设计的。 今天我来带大家看看鹿特丹市中心的立体魔方屋。这些魔方一样的房子造型独特，色彩鲜艳，吸引着一波又一波游客前来一探究竟。魔方屋是由荷兰建筑师皮特·布洛姆设计的，布洛姆是荷兰结构主义先驱阿尔多·凡·艾克的得意门生，和老师还有另一个学生赫曼·赫茨伯格一起，并称荷兰结构主义三杰。 其实，70年代中期的时候，布洛姆先在埃因霍分东北部的小城市赫蒙德设计建造了几座砖红色的立体房子，但是远不如80年代早期在鹿特丹建的这些明黄色的立体屋这么有名。如果你对这位建筑师的作品有兴趣，可以去亨赫罗专门为他而建的博物馆参观参观。 Blom’s vision for Cube Houses is to combine functionality and style to achieve livable, affordable, and beautiful homes. All the 38 cubes are attached to each other, which represents a village within a city. As you can see from the photos, these cube houses are tilted 45 degrees and are rested upon a hexagon-shaped pylon. Each house represents a tree, and all the houses together, a forest. The open space under the cubes integrates well with the rest of the city. 布洛姆设计立体屋的宗旨是，将功能性和美观性相结合，建造宜居、实惠又好看的房屋。这一建筑群所有的30个立方体都互相连接，代表了城市内的聚居区。从我拍的这些照片上也可以看到，这些房子都倾斜45度角，由六角形的柱形结构来支撑。每座房子代表一棵树，所有的房子在一起连成一片树林。上面的小立方就像树冠一样，底部“树干”边的开放空间使其连成一片，并自然的融入到周边的城市之中。 As these innovative houses are so popular among curious visitors, the residents here are often disturbed, and one owner decided to open a “show cube” and offer tours to tourists. A real Dutch entrepreneur! ;) Since his living space is so popular, it’s a great idea to make a living out of it, right? I lived in Belgium for years, so I visited the Netherlands pretty often, and was attracted by the ubiquitous adventurous and mercantile spirit, and its cultural liberalism and tolerance. The houses contain three floors: ground floor entrance, first floor with living room and open kitchen, second floor with two bedrooms and bathroom, top floor which is sometimes used as a small garden. I paid a few euros to get in and found inside just like normal houses, the main differences are the walls and windows are angled at 54.7 degrees, so around a quarter of the 100-square-meter space is unusable. It reminds me of high heels, yes they are pretty, but not so comfortable to wear. 来看这些新颖的立体屋的访客络绎不绝，里面的居民深受其扰。于是，其中有一位屋主干脆开放了自家的房子供游客付费参观。此举真是尽显荷兰的企业家精神啊！由于在荷兰南边的比利时住了几年，常常去荷兰，对这个大航海时代的第二代霸主有了些许了解。荷兰一向以开放包容，勇于冒险的开拓创新精神著称，在其他很多国民眼里都是个很酷的国家，以致于很多次的旅途谈话中，别人不知道比利时在何方的情况下，我就说我住在荷兰南边，也是说荷兰语的地方。得到的答案总是：好酷啊。呵呵，真是沾了人家荷兰不少的光啊。; ) 每间房子都有三层，底层是入口，二楼是客厅和开放式厨房，三楼有两个卧室和卫生间，顶上一般用作小花园。我付了几欧元的门票进去参观，发现室内跟普通民居的唯一差别就是墙壁和窗户呈54.7度角，也因此导致100平米的房子有大约四分之一的面积不可使用。不知怎的，我就突然想到了高跟鞋，看着漂亮，穿着却不舒服。 You can book several of the homes online to stay overnight or longer, and do it as early as possible, since they often fill up months in advance. There’s also a hostel at the ground floor called Stayokay. Along with this special living experience, the location at the city center is also convenient to explore Rotterdam, this port city known for bold, modern architecture. If you visit Cube Houses here, don’t forget to check out the Markthal (Market Hall) close by, another architecture marvel and an awesome indoor food court and fresh market. I’m going to show you this market in my next post. Stay tuned! So that’s it for today. Hope you enjoyed it! Have you visited Rotterdam? What modern architectures did you see there? Tell me your experiences in the comments below! If you like my content, upvote it and follow me for more! =) 还有几家可供住宿，只要去网上预订，但是要趁早，因为常常是提前几个月就被预订一空。底层还有一家青旅叫StayOkay, 有兴趣也可以去住住。除了体验一下这种独特的立体住宅，处于市中心的位置也为游客提供了方便。 如果你来参观这些魔方屋，别忘了去旁边的拱廊市场看看，这也是个很有特色的建筑，里面售卖蔬果禽肉等各种农产品，还有不少小吃和餐馆，被称为全球颜值最高的菜市场。我打算在下篇文章里带大家一起去看看这个现代的大市场，欢迎关注。:D 今天的图文分享就到这里，希望你们喜欢。不知道你去过鹿特丹没有？看到哪些现代建筑了呢？来留言告诉我你的想法和经历吧。 Thank you for reading. =) Check out my recent posts , and follow me for more!###36 金色布拉格随想 Golden Prague #35 Hong Kong Star Ferry Crossing at Sunset 暮色中的维港和天星小轮 #34 Traditional Clothing in Peru’s Colca Canyon 秘鲁大峡谷山民的传统服装 #33 The Exciting Drive at Gotthard Pass in Swiss Alps 全球最长的隧道山口 #32 Explore Easter Island with Me (1) - Introduction and Anakena 复活节岛摩托之旅（一） #31 Train Travels in Sri Lanka (1) 斯里兰卡的火车旅行（一） @ItchyfeetDonica is my only account here and I’m 200% real ;) → Introduce Cross-culture Me on This Cross-over Platform 处女贴-自我介绍 ##Here are some screenshots from my Instagram.

As I promised, I’m going to show you today the marvelous Market Hall next to it. Let’s start from the horseshoe-like building: 昨天带大家看了看鹿特丹市中心的立体魔方屋，今天我们再一起移步附近的拱廊大市场，这个号称全球颜值最高的菜市场。先上张入口的照片： This archy building is about 40 meters tall, and has a glass facade on both sides, which are made up of smaller glass windows. Housing also apartments and an underground garage in the complex, it is a combination of food, leisure, living and parking. The inside of the building is adorned with an 11.000 m2 artwork displaying enlarged fruits, vegetables, fish, flowers and insects. The work was made using digital 3D-animation that was separated in 4000 pieces and then printed on perforated aluminum panels. Some call this large artwork “The Sistine Chapel of Rotterdam”. Where the Market Hall was built is also an archaeological site. The site used to be a fourteenth-century buried settlement in a polder. The Dutch word “polder” is frequently associated with the Netherlands, since about half of the country’s land was reclaimed from the sea. Dutch engineers have been developing techniques to drain wetlands for agriculture and other development. There’s even an English saying: “God created the world, but the Dutch created the Netherlands”. =) Later during the building of the Market Hall, a tenth-century farm was also found 7 meters under the ground. 这个巨型拱廊高约40米，表面的灰色石块上镶嵌着大量小块玻璃窗。 除了中间的菜市场，两边和顶部建有公寓，地下还有个四层的停车场，可停1200多辆车。建筑内部的装饰画面积达11000平米，布满了放大的水果蔬菜、花鸟虫鱼等图案。这副巨作是由4000块立体动画拼成，然后打印在镂空的铝制板材上，有些人称这块大壁画为“鹿特丹的西斯廷教堂（因为西斯廷教堂的穹顶上有米开朗基罗绘制的巨型壁画《创世纪》和《最后的审判》）”。 这间巨大的菜市场里有近100间食品摊位，蔬果，禽肉，海鲜，香料，奶酪，甜点，干货，鲜花，厨具等一应俱全，还有十几家世界各地风味的餐饮店，食客也可以到上层露台休闲小憩。虽说餐馆的数量跟亚洲常见的美食街肯定是没法比，但在西方也算是吃货福利了。我来了碗越南风味的沙拉，跟在越南本土吃到的味道还挺接近的。市场里还有家中国超市和荷兰的本土超市Albert Heijn, 这间连锁超市售卖很多来自世界各地的新鲜蔬果，尤其是小青菜，香菇之类的亚洲品种，平时很难在一般比利时超市找到。由于Albert Heijn比亚超要普遍得多，所以我住在比利时的时候常常去这家荷兰超市扫货，呵呵，又是沾荷兰的光。 建造大市场的地址原是一处圩田，这里在十四世纪时曾是个小村落，在建过程中，又发现地下7米处有个十世纪的农场（可怜的荷兰人，寸土寸金啊，小小的国土到处都要物尽其用）。“圩田”这个词来自荷兰语，这也是勤劳智慧的荷兰人民千百年来填海造田的辛酸血泪史（可能我有点夸张了，说不定他们乐在其中呢 ;p 哈哈）。整个国家大约一半的土地都是朝大海要来的。英语里甚至有个说法：“世界是上帝创造的，荷兰却是荷兰人创造的”。:D ##Do you like the name of this butcher shop? Nice to meat~ Haha, isn’t it sweet? Not for vegetarians perhaps. And that national cow with tulips and a flag of the Netherlands. Hmm, this is a genuine Dutch shop… ;) 下面这个肉店的名字是不是挺有创意的？可能素食主义者并没觉得有多nice吧，呵呵，反正我这个肉食动物觉得Nice to Meat的名字起得还不错。名字旁边还有头著名的荷兰乳牛，作为从小喝着这奶粉长大的我，对它真是充满感激。 :D 牛身上还有荷兰的象征郁金香和国旗，真是家充满荷兰风情的小肉店呀。 Talking about Dutch produce, there’s no way to get around these guys in the photo below. ;) Dutch cheese is renowned around the world for its excellent quality and wide varieties. The Netherlands is also the number one cheese exporting nation. Cheese making in this flat region(great for pasture lands) dates back over 1600 years. Among all the cheeses produced in the Netherlands, Gouda is one that accounts for around half of the total production. As you can see from the first photo in this post, the one wrapped in red package is Baby Gouda. From the city Gouda, this semi-hard cheese is one of the oldest types which is still in production. Some Gouda can be aged for over a year to develop its flavor. I personally prefer the cubes of matured Gouda, which in the Netherlands are often eaten with Dutch mustard as a snack. Young Gouda cheese is commonly seen in use with sandwiches. Other popular cheeses from the country are: Edam(often eaten as a snacking cheese in combination with fruit), Maasdam(a Swiss-style cheese with distinctive holes, introduced in the 1980s to compete with Swiss Emmental), Leidse(contain cumin seeds), Limburger(similar texture to Greek Feta, pungent smell)… I’d love to tell you more about cheese in a future post, when I share with you my experience of visiting a cheese factory in Delft. :D 谈到荷兰的特产，不能不提奶酪。荷兰奶酪以质量高种类多而著称，是世界头号奶酪出口国(法国，美国等西方国家也大量生产奶酪，但大多内销)。在这块牧场众多的低地，奶酪制作已经有1600多年的历史了。 在荷兰产的各种奶酪当中，高德干酪的产量占到了大约一半。我发的第一张照片里，中间红色的包装就是高德干酪。这种软硬适中的奶酪产自高德市，有着悠久的历史。有些高德奶酪需要熟化一年多来增强风味。我个人比较喜欢成熟的高德干酪块，荷兰人常用这种块状干酪蘸着芥末当零食吃。 还有几种常见的荷兰奶酪有：大红波奶酪（有红色蜡封，正球形，一般和水果一起当零食吃），马士丹奶酪（有孔的瑞士型奶酪，上世纪80年代为了和瑞士的大孔奶酪一拼高下而推出）, 小茴香奶酪（含有小茴香种子）, 林堡奶酪（质感类似希腊的菲达羊奶酪，气味强烈）。 更多关于奶酪的分享，请关注我将来关于参观代尔夫特奶酪工厂的帖子。=) Nuts and dried fruits, often said to offer great health benefits:各种果仁和干果，据说营养价值很高： Spices:香料： Opening a coconut for me: (I will write a post about different tools used around the world to open a coconut, will you be interested? :)等他为我打开椰子：（我会写篇文讲讲世界各地看到的椰子的不同打开方式，希望你们会有兴趣？ ;D） ##See these horned melons in the photo below? I didn’t try them that day in the market but later in South America, they are pretty common in the Southern Hemisphere, and are called Inca Gold in some places in Peru and Chile. When I was researching online the origin of this fruit, I came across this, lol: The kiwano may look like a fruit from outer space (and in fact, it featured in an episode of Star Trek), but it’s a very popular snack in Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of the U.S. from “What the Heck is a Kiwano Melon and How Do You Eat It?” by Lindsay Lowe ##下面这种金黄色的奇特水果叫刺角瓜，我那天在这个市场没有尝试，后来在南美吃过不少。在秘鲁，智利的一些地方，这种瓜被叫做“印加黄金果”。我在网上查找这种水果起源的时候，偶然看到下面这段话，哈哈： 这种水果看起来就像外太空来的怪胎，而它确实也在《星际迷航》的某一集中出过镜。其实它在非洲，澳大利亚，新西兰和美国的一些地区还是种挺受欢迎的零食呢。 来自林赛•洛维的网文“刺角瓜到底是什么玩意儿，应该怎么吃” ##Combo of fresh berries:草莓桑果覆盆子： Super papaya:超级大木瓜： Mickey Mouse fruits coated in chocolate:米老鼠巧克力水果： Spanish ham and wine, also pinchos(small snacks, oh I should write a post about my trip in northern Spain where there is full of pinchos):西班牙火腿，美酒和小菜（我得写篇关于西班牙北部这种著名小菜的文章）： Flower bulbs:鲜花球茎： Asian restaurant:亚洲餐馆： I tried a Vietnamese salad, not bad, almost the same as what I tried in Vietnam:这是我当天尝试的越南沙拉，味道还可以： Ok, that’s it for today’s photo journal of the Market Hall in Rotterdam. Hope you enjoyed it like I did! =) Stay tuned for more! See you next time. 好了，今天关于拱廊大市场就介绍到这里，希望你有所收获，欢迎留言告诉我你的想法哦。中英双语加这么多照片，几乎用尽带宽和脑力，各位走过路过千万不要错过为这来之不易的文章点赞啊！下次见！=) Thank you for reading.

I also shared my experience of visiting the only tropical beach Anakena. Today I’m going to show you the best spot on the island for watching sunset - Ahu Akivi. From the picture below(shot from my DK travel book of Chile, also shown in my previous post), you can see that the overall shape of Easter Island is triangular. The main and only village Hanga Roa is located at the southwest. The photos in this post were all taken at the site number 3 - Ahu Akivi, which was a short motor scooter ride from our homestay in Hanga Roa. ##大家好！我在上篇关于复活节岛的第一篇文章里简要介绍了波利尼西亚文化大三角的历史地理、复活节岛的社会发展和旅游概况，也带各位去看了岛上唯一的热带珊瑚沙滩 — 阿纳凯纳。今天这篇，请跟我一起来探索岛上观日落的最佳地点 — 阿基围。 从下面的地图（拍于我的DK智利旅游指南书）上可以看出，复活节岛大致呈三角形。主要的人口聚居地汉加努阿处于岛的西南。这篇文章里所有的照片都拍摄于下图中的景点三 — 阿基围。从这里到汉加努阿我们住的民宿，骑踏板摩托车很快就可以到达。 Ahu(ceremonial platform) Akivi was set up around the 16th century and it’s aligned in an east–west direction with 7 Moais(the giant monolithic stone statue) of equal size and shape, which are all 4.9m tall and 18 tons of weight. It is surrounded by agricultural land and rolling hills, as you can see from my photos here: Ahu Akivi is quite unique on Easter Island, since the 7 identical statues here all face towards the sea, while almost all other Moai statues on the island face the village as a protective mana. Mana is believed to be the supernatural power in Polynesian culture and is part of contemporary Pacific Islander culture. The early Rapa Nui people consider Moai statues as their ancestors or Tupuna. Tupuna were seen as the reincarnation of their clan leaders or prestigious kings. The Moais were erected to protect the Rapa Nui people and to bring prosperity to their clan and village. Legend has it that the Rapa Nui people positioned the 7 Ahu Akivi statues towards the Pacific Ocean to propitiate the sea to help the navigators. According to Wikipedia: However, according to an oral tradition, Hotu Matu’s priest had a dream in which the King’s soul flew across the ocean when the Rapa Nui island was seen by him. He then sent scouts navigating across the sea to locate the island and to find people to settle there. Seven of these scouts stayed back on the island waiting for the king to arrive. These seven are represented by the seven stone statues erected in their honour. Another unique feature of Ahu Akivi is that it is a sacred celestial observatory. The 7 Moais here face exactly the sunset during the Spring Equinox, and have their backs right to the sunrise during the Autumn Equinox. And that middle point also aligns with the Moon. You can only find such an astronomically precise feature at this particular location on Easter Island. Amazing, isn’t it? That’s why we rode to this spot in the later afternoon, as we thought to watch the sunset here over the 7 Moais and the Pacific Ocean should be a good choice. And it was! Look at the photos I took during the golden hour. It’s not the most stunning sunset I have ever seen, and these photos are not my best sunset photos neither. But a beautiful sunset on Easter Island, one of the most remote places in the middle of the ocean; in a relatively rainier season; and this special location on the island, all made it pretty epic. =) ##So that’s it for today’s sharing about Ahu Akivi. I hope you like it! =) Please tell me what you think in the comments. I will show you more of my experiences on this enchanting island in my future posts.

Today I would like to introduce you a restaurant in Bali, Indonesia, which doesn’t only boast traditional duck dishes and idyllic tropical setting, but also has an interesting story to tell. This restaurant is called Bebek Bengil, best known for its authentic crispy duck dishes since 1990. Just like QuanJude Peking Duck Restaurant in Beijing, Bebek Bengil is a big draw for visitors to Bali island. 大家好！今天我要给各位介绍一家印尼巴厘岛上的餐馆—— 脏鸭馆。这家餐馆不仅有久负盛名的特色鸭肉菜肴和热带风情满满的庭园，还有跟脏鸭有关的有趣故事。就像全聚德烤鸭之于北京，很多人来到巴厘岛也会尝尝这家颇具特色的脏鸭餐。 When I lived in Bali, I went to eat regularly in this Dirty Duck restaurant located near my homestay in Ubud. There’s also a branch in Nusa Dua by beach. Now it has expanded to outlets outside Bali in Jakarta, including the main restaurant in Menteng. As you can see from the photo above, its gate is not so big, while there’s a whole new world inside. After you pass through the main dining hall, the winding path leads you through the lush green garden to an open field of rice. You can also choose to enjoy your meal in the traditional Balinese cottage here, in this well manicured garden or by the lovely rice field. At the same time, there are a flock of ducks enjoying their meals in the mud of the field. I heard about the story of these ducks from the owner of my homestay in Ubud, and now I see them in person(duck). But of course these ducks are not really the same ducks in the story of 1990, since a duck can normally live a few years up to 15 or 20 maybe(sorry that I don’t have any experience with old ducks) . So it comes to the name Dirty Duck restaurant. Why is it so? When I opened the menu on the table, the story was also printed on the first page: When we were building the restaurant, we thought long and hard of a name. Many suggestions came from our friends, but none seemed just right. We knew we wanted a Balinese name that translated well into English. One tropical monsoon morning, when the original restaurant was almost finished, a flock of ducks from rice fields across the road ran quacking and squawking into the restaurant, and across the floor and tables. They left their muddy, webbed footprints all over the place. They were our first guests, these ‘Dirty Ducks’. It’s said that another reason the restaurant is called Dirty Duck is: when the ducks are fried and grilled, their skins turn darker and look dirty. ##我住在巴厘岛时，这家脏鸭餐厅的乌布店离住处不远，所以常常去大快朵颐。岛上的另一家分店在努沙杜瓦的海滩边。现在脏鸭馆已经走出巴厘岛，在首都雅加达也开设了分店。 从上图可以看出，餐厅门脸不大，而进去后其实别有洞天。穿过食客云集，人头攒动的前厅大堂，再沿着曲折的小径绕过绿意葱茏的热带花园，便来到一片广阔的稻田。花园里和稻田边的亭台中也摆设了传统巴厘岛式的餐桌和软垫，供食客盘腿用餐。稻田里，几只鸭子閭在泥水中悠闲自在地觅食。 去之前就听乌布民宿的主人讲到这些鸭子的故事，来到饭店后，打开菜单，第一页就印着脏鸭馆名字的由来，主角自然是这些鸭子们閭，或者更确切地说，是这些鸭子的前辈们 ; )。（我好奇地随手查了一下，据说鸭子的平均寿命为5到15年。掐指一算，就算是这些鸭子中的老寿星，可能也很难从餐馆开业的1990年活到现在吧。所以说此鸭非彼鸭。）回到故事的主题来，那么为什么叫“脏鸭馆” 呢？ 当初餐馆在建时，我们就为起名而苦思冥想，很多朋友也给出建议，却没有一个合适的。我们一直想起个传统的巴厘名字，同时译成英语也要很恰当。 一个刮着热带季风的清晨，餐厅就要完工之时，一群鸭子从马路对面的稻田里呱呱呱地奔过来，穿过地板和桌子，一时间，到处都留下泥泞的蹼状脚印。这些脏兮兮的鸭子们也成了我们餐厅里的第一批客人。 其次，鸭子在油炸、烧烤的烹制过程中，表皮颜色变深，看上去脏脏的，也成了被称为“脏鸭”的一个原因。 One time when I was waiting to be served, I spotted a lizard in the garden:有一次在等上菜间歇，我在花园里还看到一只黄腹蜥蜴： What you see in the photo below is the renowned signature Dirty Duck dish. It is half a duck steamed in Indonesian spices, deep fried for a crispy finish. It is served with sautéed potatoes or rice, and Balinese vegetable salad. 下图第一张就是有名的原味脏鸭。这些鸭肉先由印尼的特色香料腌制，再通过油炸制成。鸭肉鲜美，表皮脆嫩有弹性，脂肪含量低，搭配微煎的土豆或米饭，就着新鲜的辣椒酱料和巴厘岛蔬菜沙拉，别有一番风味。 What I like the most is the Bebek Bakar Sambal Hijau(Grilled Duck with Green Chili Sauce) in the head image and the last photo below. Comparing to the dry original Dirty Duck, I prefer the more succulent meat when it’s grilled. So I usually ordered this one when I came to Bebek Bengil. The different sorts of sambal(Southeast Asian sauce made from chili peppers or/and other ingredients) aside are awesome as well. I will write a post about making these fresh sambals in future. On their menu, you can also find other duck dishes such as Duck Breast with Wine Sauce, which is more western like. But whatever I ordered there, it’s always served a big portion, along with great service. 而题图和下面的这张图里是我最喜欢的烤鸭配青椒酱和土豆饭，个人觉得这烤出来的鸭肉相比口感很干的油炸原味脏鸭更加可口多汁。所以我去脏鸭馆总是点这道菜，还会特意要求加上旁边的几种辣酱。这些鲜辣的酱料对我这个无辣不欢的人来说自然是必不可少，将来我会写写怎么制作这些辣酱。 菜单上还看到有西式的红酒鸭胸和其他鸭肉做成的佳肴，足以满足各种口味的需要。值得一提的是，这家脏鸭的口味并不是次次如一，去过的几次，同样的鸭肉菜品，有时候吃起来很赞，有时候吃起来却有些腥味，不知道是鸭子本身的缘故还是烹饪的问题。对我来说，这家餐厅的优点主要在于其传统特色，食物分量，服务质量和用餐环境。 However, the best flavors, in my opinion, are usually found in local markets, on street stands or at locals’ home kitchens, but not in this kind of famous restaurants among tourists. So, next time I’m going to bring you to a local market in Bali and learn from a local chef how to cook the authentic cuisine. Stay tuned and until next time! =) 当然，最好吃的本地菜通常都在某街边小巷里，而不是在这种驰名游客的大餐馆。下一次我会带大家去一家当地的菜市场看看，跟着本地厨师学做印尼菜。敬请期待！=)  Thank you for reading.  Check out my recent posts , and follow me for more! ☝️###41 Explore Easter Island with Me (2) - Best Sunset Spot Ahu Akivi  复活节岛摩托之旅（二） #40 Monomad Macro Photography ~ Friday Flowers   单色微距摄影 #39 B&amp;W Photo Contest ~ Windmill Reflection  黑白摄影 - 荷兰风车倒影 #38 Visit the Rotterdam Market Hall with Me 燎 菱   全球颜值最高的菜市场究竟长什么样? #37 Cube Houses in Rotterdam 探秘鹿特丹的魔方房 #36 金色布拉格随想   Golden Prague #35 Hong Kong Star Ferry Crossing at Sunset 暮色中的维港和天星小轮 @ItchyfeetDonica is my only account here and I’m 200% real ;) → Introduce Cross-culture Me on This Cross-over Platform 处女贴-自我介绍 ##Here are some screenshots from my Instagram.

Located in the Torres del Paine National Park, Grey Glacier flows southward into a lake called Lago Grey. This glacier is part of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. Together with the Northern Patagonian Ice Field, the ice cap is the world’s 3rd largest mass of ice after Antarctica and Greenland. Since I haven’t yet got time and budget to either of the two poles, it’s pretty awesome as well to explore this more accessible glacier at first. So let’s get started to have a glance at this more approachable beauty! =) 我住在智利的时候，有幸去南部的格雷冰川一探究竟，拍下了帖子里的这些照片。格雷冰川位于百内国家公园内，向南流向格雷湖。格雷冰川是南巴塔哥尼亚冰原的一部分，而南北冰原则构成了继南极大陆和格陵兰岛之后的世界第三大面积的冰盖。在有闲有钱去到那两块神秘高冷的大陆烧银子之前，先让我带着各位瞅瞅格雷冰川这位比较平易近人的邻家冰美人吧。;) If you follow the famous big circuit of Paine Mountain Range at John Garner Pass, you will see the glacier and the lake surface. Since we had limited time and didn’t feel very hardcore anymore after a long trip in southern Chile, we just walked to Lago Grey to take a boat to see this natural wonder. Even walking to Lago Grey was not so easy as imagined - I will describe it with photos in my next post. =) When I was there in 2016, the glacier was 6km wide and more than 30m high. And according to the officials at Torres del Paine National Park, a large iceberg broke off the Grey glacier in November of 2017: If you are an annoying curious kid like me when I was little(doesn’t change much today), you may wonder why the ice here looks blue? (Clearing throat… ready for the science lesson? I learnt the following in Chinese when I was in school, so it’s interesting for me to write it down now in English ;p) Because the red (long wavelengths) part of white light is absorbed by ice, and the blue (short wavelengths) light is transmitted and scattered. Snow is compressed when falling on a glacier, and over years of pressure, the compressed snow develops into part of the glacier. During the process, the air caught in the ice is squeezed out, leaving little reflective surface for the sunlight. Without the scattering effect of air bubbles, light can penetrate ice undisturbed. So, here I captured all these photos of the “blue” ice to the naked eye. Following the changes of the sunlight and clouds, the glacier and icebergs appeared in different hues - light blue, blue-green, deep blue, blue with a warm glow… all look so brilliant. 如果你跟我一样是个惹人烦的对什么都充满好奇的人，你可能会问为什么这些冰川冰山看上去都是蓝色的呢？嘿嘿，根据《十万个为什么》，这是因为……请先看上面的英文吧，有空我会翻译的。;) Floating icebergs calved from the glacier: For more details and images, check out my following post!  Thank you for reading.  Check out my recent posts , and follow me for more! ☝️###44 Follow Me to Grey Glacier (2) 格雷冰川初探(二） #42 The Story of Dirty Duck Restaurant 閭 脏鸭馆的美食故事 #41 Explore Easter Island with Me (2) - Best Sunset Spot Ahu Akivi  复活节岛摩托之旅（二） #40 Monomad Macro Photography ~ Friday Flowers   单色微距摄影 #39 B&amp;W Photo Contest ~ Windmill Reflection  黑白摄影 - 荷兰风车倒影 #38 Visit the Rotterdam Market Hall with Me 燎 菱   全球颜值最高的菜市场究竟长什么样? #37 Cube Houses in Rotterdam 探秘鹿特丹的魔方房 @ItchyfeetDonica is my only account here and I’m 200% real ;) → Introduce Cross-culture Me on This Cross-over Platform 处女贴-自我介绍 ##Here are some screenshots from my Instagram.

This icecap has 2 parts: the Northern and the Southern Patagonian Ice Fields. Grey Glacier is part of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. As a map maniac  , I just sketched a map to show you the rough locations of the 2 ice fields and the Grey Glacier I’m talking about here(Please ignore the distortion of my map ;) anyway, accurate world map is mathematically impossible to make :p): The Southern Ice field remains a border issue between Chile and Argentina. It stretches over 3 National Parks including Los Glaciares Park of Argentina, Bernado O’Higgins Park and Torres del Paine Park in Chile. First, let’s take a look at these 3 amazing national parks covered by The Southern Ice field: Los Glaciares National Park boasts the world-famous glacier Perito Moreno, best known for the dramatic icefalls from its front wall, and the breathtaking mountain Fitz Roy near El Chaltén which I wrote about in this post. Parque Nacional Bernardo O’Higgins is a remote region less explored in southern Chile, which I accessed on the way to Torres del Paine(I also had a post about it). It’s an absolute gem I discovered by accident, and I was amazed by its fjords, icebergs, glaciers and diverse wildlife in a tranquil setting. The indigenous Kawéskar people call the village of Puerto Edén their home. Last but the most famous Torres del Paine National Park - it’s located in Chile’s Patagonia region, and takes its name from the 3 iconic granite towers( Tres Torres) and the horn-shaped peaks called Cuernos del Paine. Here you can see rare wildlife such as guanacos, pumas, huemul deers and the Andean condos. The glaciers in these 2 posts are also located in the Park. 直到今天，智利和阿根廷还在为这块倾国倾城的南冰原起争端。从上面我手绘的地图上可以看出: 上方那一小块阴影是北冰原，下方较长的阴影是南冰原，这也是两国存在领土纠纷的地方。 先来科普一下 —— 南冰原覆盖三大国家公园：位于阿根廷的冰川国家公园，归属智利的伯纳多奥希金斯国家公园和百内塔国家公园。 这几个公园都是自然风光美不胜收的地方，其中百内塔国家公园和冰川国家公园比较知名，而伯纳多奥希金斯国家公园相比之下更鲜为人知，自然也是更具野趣。我在经由水路坐船去百内国家公园的途中，去这里走了一圈，意外地发现这个藏在深闺的秘境：美丽壮观的峡湾、冰山和冰川湖，独特的植被和野生动物，还有附近的土著居民，这一切都在宁静中和谐共生，犹如一片世外桃源。 。。。 这两篇文章里的格雷冰川就位于百内国家公园内。 Apart from the Southern Ice Field you see from my sketched map, the Northern Patagonia Ice Field forms the smaller part of the Patagonian Icecap. The sparsely populated area - Aysen region of Chile is defined partly by this ice field. After traveling through Chile, I found this region one of my favorites for its breathtaking wild beauty. If I’m going back to Chile in future, I would love to trek the Aysen Glacier Trail (AGT) , where I can get up close to the glaciers of the Northern Ice Cap, and enjoy a great variety of landscapes. I talked about why the glacier ice appears blue to the naked eye in my last post - in short, it’s because of the short wavelengths blue light is transmitted and scattered, when squeezed out air in compressed snow leaves little reflective surface on a glacier for the sunlight. Since the weather was constantly changing, the mountains, glacier and icebergs were coated in different hues as the lighting changed, and a rainbow showed up: For more photos of the landscape, please check out my previous post. : ) The crew is collecting some thousand-year-old glacier ice to serve with the Pisco Sour, the South American cocktail classic, claimed as a creation by both Peru  and Chile  . Pisco is a kind of grape brandy, made by distilling fermented grape juice into a high-proof spirit. The essential mix of a Pisco Sour is 3 parts Pisco to 1 part lime juice and 1 part sugar syrup, with fresh egg white as well. In future I will write about my experience of visiting a Pisco distillery in the Elqui Valley in Chile. This kind of dramatic lenticular cloud formation is pretty common here. As the lens clouds look like flying saucers, they have been mistaken by some people as UFOs . Patagonia is known for its blustery winds. I was almost blown away in places like Punta Arenas, and here it’s even more windy  . I definitely caught the strongest wind in my life in the area of Lago Grey - I could barely stand still, not to say walk against the incredibly heavy wind. On my way back, I had to struggle each and every step trying not to be dragged into the lake: So that’s it for today’s sharing about my trip to Grey Glacier. Hope you enjoyed it as I did!

For some of you out there, the coming big day might be Valentine’s Day, while for Chinese people worldwide, the fast approaching important holiday is the Chinese New Year. February 16th is the day Chinese New Year falls on in 2018. And the Spring Festival will last to March 2nd, about 15 days in total. In China, most working people will have a week holiday around the New Year, starting from New Year’s Eve or a bit earlier. This holiday is normally called Golden Week Holiday of Spring Festival. Just like the Christmas holiday for westerners, Spring Festival is of great importance for Chinese family reunions. The Lunar Calendar##So why does the 2018 Chinese New Year land on February 16th instead of January 1st? It is because the Spring Festival in China is based on the lunar calendar, which is decided by the monthly cycles of the Moon’s phases, also known as synodic months. As a result, the Chinese New Year has no exact date each year, but it mostly falls on a day in January or February in Gregorian calendar, roughly the same dates of Aquarius sign in the Western Zodiac. Actually, there’s also a Chinese Valentine’s Day(Qixi/Qiqiao Festival) originated from a beautiful romantic legend, which falls on the 7th day of the 7th month on the Chinese lunar calendar, so it’s usually some day in July or August in Gregorian Calendar. And a fun fact here: my birthday is February 7th, which fell on the Chinese New Year’s Eve of my birth year. Imagine when other Chinese were wolfing down the grand meal on New Year’s Eve, my mom was struggling hard to give birth to me. What a great mom! :D Last week on my birthday, I got birthday wishes from some friends, but not from my mom. After I told her about this “news”, she was quite surprised, saying “Oh really? I only remember it’s on New Year’s Eve, so it will be on February 15th this year.” I guess I can’t blame her, since some older generations in China are more used to the dates on traditional lunar calendar. ㊗️各位同胞春节快乐，狗年大吉！因为这些年客居海外，最近几年是在南美和澳洲过的春节，周围没有喜庆年味的拍照内容，所以下面是我用最近在澳洲拍的一张照片做的贺卡，希望你们喜欢！=) 照片上的景点是澳大利亚大洋路上有名的十二门徒岩，由于长期的海水海风侵蚀，现在只剩八根石灰岩柱了。这里通常风大浪急，雾气弥漫，我在冷风中凭栏远眺了一会儿，正好看到这群黑色的海鸟飞过，于是定格瞬间。 The Twelve Apostles in Australia##Since I haven’t lived in China for years, I don’t have any new-year themed pictures at hand for my blog images. I can imagine all the red dog-themed decorations all over China now. In fact, I spent the Chinese New Year in hot summers of the Southern Hemisphere (South America and Australia) for the past few years. So please excuse me and enjoy this view of The Twelve Apostles from Victoria, Australia. I made 2 greeting cards out of the photo that I took last month. This is the star sight on the star route - the Great Ocean Road. What makes my shot a bit special is the flock of black birds flying by. =) Originally there were twelve limestone stacks off the shore, but due to the gradual erosion caused by the sea and wind, now only eight Apostles left. Have you been to the eight apostles on the Great Ocean Road? And which greeting card do you prefer? The first portrait one or the second landscape one? :D I mentioned above red dog-themed decorations, since 2018 is the Year of the Dog according to the ancient zodiac animal signs in Chinese culture. I will talk about this old tradition in my next post about Chinese New Year. =) What do you know about the Spring Festival in China? Tell me your thoughts and experiences in the comments below!

Los Dominicos is a village of shops made of mud and straw. Renovated from an old barn and some stables, this place is for artisans and artists to create and sell their handcrafts and artworks to the public. I know, it sounds totally irrelevant to this peacock, right? But I captured its images in this village, and it is truly an interesting place for arts and crafts lovers, so I am going to blog about this village in my future post. =) Renowned for their gorgeous plumage, peacocks are popular in many countries especially in Asia. People love to watch their fan-like crest of the beautiful feathers. Three distinct species of peafowl(male ones) are found - the blue Indian peafowl originally of the Indian subcontinent; the green peafowl of Southeast Asia; and the Congo peafowl which is an African species. The blue Indian peafowl is seen as one of the national symbols in India. Their images can be commonly found in architectures and utensils in the country. In some ethnic groups in Southwest China, peacock is also seen as a ‘sacred bird’, that is adored by the local people and is imitated in their traditional dances. 经 #cn 中文区几位前辈提醒，摄影作品也可以参加月旦评，所以我这里发一组孔雀的照片参赛。 孔雀因其色彩鲜艳的羽毛和优雅的姿态广受各国人民喜爱。蓝孔雀在印度被尊为国鸟，形象常见于庙宇等建筑的图案中和日常生活的器皿上。在我国傣族人民的心中，孔雀也是“圣鸟”，是幸福吉祥的象征。傣族孔雀舞是久负盛名的传统民间舞蹈, 也被杨丽萍等舞蹈艺术家在国际舞台发扬光大。 孔雀自古以来便常见于我国的文学作品中，汉代已有 “孔雀东南飞，五里一徘徊” 的诗歌名句叙述封建礼教束缚下的爱情悲剧。无独有偶，英国作家D·H·劳伦斯的小说《白孔雀》中也描述了20世纪英格兰中部农村青年男女的不幸婚姻，批判了工业机械文明对自然生态的破坏，和传统价值观对人类本能的压抑和扭曲。 这三张孔雀的照片拍摄于智利首都圣地亚哥的多米尼哥艺术村。这个村子是由一座旧谷仓和几个马厩改建的，有很多泥土和稻草盖起来的小店，供艺术家和手工艺匠人们进行创作并售卖作品。好吧，虽然说的这些跟这只孔雀好像没有半毛钱关系，但是，我真的是在这个村子里拍到人家的，哈哈。我以后会写写这个有意思的地方，敬请期待！（感觉我已经开了无数空头支票，欠下好多血债……我会加油写的~） https://steemitimages.com/DQmWxeA94gxxSbqh1ffbVW5QKU66QAJnU2kXpgAfZftTner/File%20Feb%2015%2C%2022%2011%2002.jpeg Camera settings of the head image:相机设置： ##What do you think of these photos?

Today I’m sharing with you 4 monochrome photos shot in Europe and South America, and the stories behind them. I’m inspired by the B&amp;W Photo Contest hosted by @daveks, and the Animal Shadow contest by @melinda010100. I appreciate their efforts in building an active photography community on #Steemit.  今天这组参加月旦评的黑白摄影取材于南美和欧洲四个不同的地方，具体请看下面的说明： Eduardo Avaroa, Bolivia This picture was taken at sunrise at a hot spring in Eduardo Avaroa National Reserve of Andean Fauna, near Laguna Colorada in Bolivia, not far from the borders of Chile and Argentina.It’s heart (and body of course :D) warming to soak in a hot thermal bath in the freezing morning. And I was mesmerized by the shadows and the steam that were dancing in the first glow in the tranquil wildness:这张照片是在玻利维亚和智利、阿根廷边界不远处的一个地热温泉池边用手机拍的。日出，几乎零下的气温中，泡个温泉♨️是有多暖心，你懂的。清晨的第一缕微光随着升腾起的氤氲水汽跃动起舞，泡汤人的身影在这静谧的荒野中缓缓流转，被高原紫外线晒得黝黑的当地姑娘，戴着圆礼帽，身穿厚厚的蓬蓬裙坐在一边，远处起伏的山峦若隐若现。眼前的一切仿如幻境。*Pula Arena, Croatia The amphitheater below is not the Colosseum in Rome, but the Pula Arena of Croatia. This arena is one of the six largest surviving Roman amphitheaters in the world, and is among the best preserved few. Pula is a pretty port city known for its multitude of ancient Roman buildings. I visited the inside in the late afternoon and waited till at night when the amphitheater was closed, so there was only me there by the fence. Beautiful serenity. The Arena was lit then by warm yellow lights in peace and quiet. You can see my lonely shadow as well as the shadows of the fence and the stone structures: 上面这建筑可不是意大利罗马的斗兽场哦，而是克罗地亚普拉市的竞技场。这是全球现存的六大古罗马竞技场之一，也是保存最完好的位于海边的一座。 我下午进去参观了一下，出来后在附近逛了一会儿，等它关门后又去隔着栏杆拍了几张照片，因为只有这种时候才能拍到空寂的竞技场。于是便有了我和栏杆，还有石墙投在地面的影子。美妙的清静。 Museum Honestino Guimarães, Brazil This retrofuturistic building below is the National Museum of the Republic in Brasília, also known as Museum Honestino Guimarães. It is designed by the famous architect Oscar Niemeyer, who is the chief designer of the city’s modern architectures. Both the building and the skateboarder cast shadows which form an interesting contrast between the different shapes and shades. If you are interested in more photos of this architecture, check out my post - Niemeyer’s Artwork Through My Lens (1)  这座独特的白色建筑是巴西的共和国博物馆，为共和国文化建筑群的一部分，由世界闻名的巴西国父级建筑师奥斯卡·内梅耶设计，巴西利亚的主要现代建筑物都是由他一手设计建造的。照片里的博物馆和滑板男孩都投下了阴影，在各异的形体和明暗间形成了有趣的对比。 如果你想了解更多这场馆，可以去我以前的帖子 —— 内梅耶建筑艺术实拍（一） 看看不同角度的照片和介绍。 Kotor, Montenegro https://steemitimages.com/DQmdTsjaZYgBW8sTXcGWRPiRsMAkpuBje3WxobMA9tZTqb4/File%20Feb%2017%2C%2001%2004%2043.jpeg ##This last photo of a cute kitten is my entry for the contest hosted by @melinda010100 themed Animal Shadow. I captured this one afternoon when I was strolling a street in Kotor of Montenegro. Kotor is a beautiful coastal town surrounded by fortifications built during the Venetian period. Used to be a Mediterranean port, Kotor is also known for its large amount of cats all over the streets. There’s even a Cats Museum dedicated for these little creatures. If you love cats, don’t miss the chance to check out this museum when you visit Kotor! 这只小黑猫是不是挺可爱？那天下午，我在黑山共和国的猫城科托尔街上闲逛，满大街到处都是喵星人，似乎比地球人都多。 黑山共和国的风景美得让人流连忘返，其中科托尔又是地中海边一颗闪耀的明珠。这座精致的古城随处都是威尼斯时代留下的建筑痕迹，还有个专门的猫咪博物馆。如果你是位爱猫人士，去到黑山时可别忘了去这里看看哦！ So that’s it for today’s stories of shadows.

One summer, my mom came to visit me, and I brought her to the Scheldt River in Antwerp for some fresh breeze from the sea. When we were strolling along the river, there was a little girl in front of us trying to look into a telescope’s viewfinder for the view in distance, but somehow it’s not working after she put in a coin. I captured her disappointed face at that moment. And I never knew that one day on Steemit, there would be a photography contest themed DISAPPOINTMENT ;), so I believe my photos below are a perfect match for this theme. :D 我曾经住在比利时的安特卫普附近，所以常常去这座城市逛各种市场、博物馆、设计小店、手工作坊等。那年夏天，我妈过来看我，碰上难得的炎热天气，所以我带她去靠海的斯海尔德河漫步吹风。走着走着，前面有个小女孩引起了我的注意，她摆弄着一台河边的望远镜，想看看远方的风景，试着投放了几次硬币也没有成功，估计是出了故障，我就随手记录下了她此刻失望迷茫的表情。没想到今天刚看到一个摄影活动的主题是“失望”，所以我就挖出这两张几年前的照片来参赛，也来参加中文区的摄影月旦评。 =) https://steemitimages.com/DQmRBL7rKHFhhCDhodvL5EytDw85HFKmVJ25AZq6kQ2xLnw/IMG_1528.JPGhttps://steemitimages.com/DQmVLf7kT3qENhFEoV9kDAnp4jX2JMGVMTVqP37eaqL7btp/IMG_1529.JPG ##Antwerp is a gem that I’d love to talk about a bit more. =) Lonely Planet calls this city “the country’s capital of cool”, “a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers”(I hope this quote won’t get the cheetah bot here ;p ) . I once wrote a post about the beautiful Groenplaats in this city. Check it out if interested. And in my coming post I will focus on a few cool sights along the Scheldt River. I actually already wrote a draft about some places to see, then I quickly realize that this post is getting too long and is overshadowing this main topic of “disappointed girl”, so I’m cutting it here and will continue in my next post. What do you think of these shots? Have you been to Antwerp or Belgium? Feel free to share your comments below. Stay tuned and see you soon! =) 安特卫普一直是我很喜欢的欧洲城市之一，也是常被一般去欧洲的游人忽略的地方，所以我想继续聊聊它。: )《孤独星球》把它称为“比利时的酷都”，说它“强烈吸引着时尚艺术爱好者、酒吧俱乐部迷和钻石经销商”。我曾经写过一篇这座城市迷人的绿色广场。接下来我想介绍下斯海尔德河岸边的艺术区和几座独特的新旧建筑。其实我已经写了不少，有点刹不住的感觉，才意识到完全抢了此文主体“失望的小女孩”的风头，所以想想还是留待下一篇继续扯吧。我们下回见喽！ 你对这两张照片有什么看法？去过比利时或安特卫普吗？欢迎留言评论。=) Thank you for reading.

As I promised, in this post, I’m talking on about another topic - Zodiac Animals. Earlier on I realized 2018 is a year of Dog, as I noticed some Chinese app icons on my phone screen turned to dog-themed ones. So why is 2018 a Dog Year? Last weekend, I went to a Chinese New Year celebration in Caboolture by the Moreton Bay(Moreton Bay bugs anyone? ;p), north of Brisbane. There I happened to see a workshop of making zodiac animal lanterns. So I’m explaining this Chinese tradition with the story of the workshop. You probably know that 12 zodiac animals are used to date a repeating cycle of 12 years in China. From the photo of Zodiac Wheel above that I took at the workshop, you can see the 12 animals and the birth years they represent. In order, the 12 animals are rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. Their order is decided by Chinese Yin and Yang Theory and perceived attributes, each with its associated Earthly Branch. The Dog is the eleventh on the list. You can find 2018 in the Dog section on the Zodiac Wheel. Since 12 is a cycle, the next Dog year will be 2030, and the following year 2019 will be the Year of the Pig. In the workshop, kids are taught to look for their animal signs from the Zodiac Wheel according to their birth years. And they learn to write the Chinese character of that animal onto the lantern. Here are the instructions of making the Chinese New Year lanterns: They are having fun writing Chinese and making the lanterns: This workshop seems to be a great way to help these Australian children understand a bit about the zodiac animals in Chinese culture, and they learn it in a fun creative way by DIY their own lanterns. What do you think of this Zodiac Animal Lantern Workshop? Chinese Zodiac Culture There are many legends related to Chinese zodiac and the versions are varied in different regions. According to one Chinese mythology, an emperor hosted a race to select the first 12 animals that cross the river to represent the years. Just as an ox was about to win the race, a rat went ahead by leaping on his head and on to the bank. And the slow pig was the last on the list. You may wonder why the common domestic animal cat is absent from the Zodiac list. Most historians agree that this animal list was formed before cats were introduced to China from India with Buddhism. But the cat has made it into Vietnamese zodiac cycle, so not too bad for him/her. ;) In Madarin, the animal zodiac is called ‘shengxiao’, which literally means ‘born resembling’. Traditionally, people born in a certain year are said to have the attributes of the symbol animal. For instance, people who were born in the Dog year are said to be friendly and faithful, on the other side, they can be indecisive and pessimistic. Besides the 12 years, the 12 zodiac animals are also associated with hours of a day in Chinese culture. Ancient Chinese divided a day into twelve periods, each 2-hour period is represented by an animal to tell the time. It starts from Rat period which is 11pm to 1am, and ends with Pig period which is 9pm to 11pm. In ancient Chinese culture, and still in some rural regions in contemporary China, the Zodiac signs play an integral part in social life. The animal signs, together with other elements, such as palmistry, face characteristics, the five nature elements, birth month, day, and hour, can be used to tell one’s fortune, one’s compatibility with the other half in a relationship or marriage, one’s career fit, etc.. A palm reader and his Russian customers in Da Lat, Vietnam: ##It’s like the fortune telling using the system of Western Astrology, you choose to believe it or not. For me, the Chinese animal zodiac or the Western astrological sign is just a kind of interesting fun tradition. Anyway, how could people be the same just being born in the same year or same month with some similar elements? But I don’t mind it when people tell me something like ‘ Your birth animal is cool’ , or ‘Aquarius kicks ass.’ ;) What about you? Do you believe in these Zodiac signs?

The tulips in the first picture were captured in Keukenhof. Keukenhof is known as the largest flower garden in the world, and it’s situated in Lisse, a town south of Haarlem, between Amsterdam and The Hague in Netherlands. There are over 3000 varieties of tulips, with many different colors too. White tulips are popular as wedding bouquets. They are in the range from pure white to a more creamy white. Tulips are widely cultivated in the Netherlands, and in the spring, tulip festivals abound throughout the country. Besides Keukenhof, you can find a huge amount of tulips in places like Kop van Noord-Holland, Noordoostpolder, and Aalsmeer. The Dutch people loved bringing tulips to new countries when they settled down abroad, for example, in New York, there is also a tulip festival. Originally named New Amsterdam, there is a strong connection here to Dutch roots. And in this post, I’d love to share with you the famous story of Tulip Mania in history: The Story of Tulip Mania Although the Netherlands is known for tulips, these flowers were not originally from there. They were imported from the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century. Later in 1592, a French pioneering botanist Carolus Clusius wrote the first major book on tulips, which made this flower so popular that his garden was raided, and people kept stealing the bulbs. Tulips became more and more popular as the Dutch Golden Age grew. It’s a common subject in paintings and festivals at that time. In the mid-seventeenth century, as a result of buying up bulbs, the tulips were getting so expensive that they were used as money until the market crashed. They even created the first economic bubble in history, known as “Tulip Mania”. Today, “Tulip Mania” is often used to refer to a large economic bubble when the asset price deviates from the intrinsic value. Sounds familiar? Yep, some people compare the #cryptocurrency mania or #bitcoin craze to “Tulip Mania”. Of course there is also voice against this view. I’m not an expert on this, but time will tell. Since my post is inspired by the White is White Contest by @dmcamera, and the “A City A Story” Photo Contest by @aaronli, I will stick to only white flowers here. In my future post about travel tips to this garden, I’m going to include more pictures from Keukenhof. All photos by me with my old friend Canon Kiss X3 and lens EF-S 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM. Enjoy these white beauties! =) Which photo or flowers do you like the most? Have you heard about the story of “Tulip Mania”? Feel free to share your comments below! Until next time. :D 这是我拍的一组以白色花朵为主题的照片。其中第二、三两张里的白玫瑰和白雏菊都挺常见，而第一张白色郁金香比较少见，所以介绍一下。这是在荷兰库肯霍夫的花卉公园里拍的，位于阿姆斯特丹和海牙之间的利瑟市。 郁金香有3000多种，颜色也很多样。白色郁金香在西方的婚礼上常被用作新娘的捧花。 不只在荷兰本土的很多地方能看到大量郁金香，在其他一些地方比如纽约，也有郁金香花节。这是因为早期荷兰移民抵达纽约时，把这些花的球茎也一起带了过去。纽约最初的名字是“新阿姆斯特丹”，可见这里与荷兰深厚的渊源。 历史上有个有名的“郁金香泡沫”事件。虽然荷兰以郁金香之国闻名，但是这种花却是16世纪时从奥斯曼帝国引进荷兰的。引进后不久，1592年，一名先锋植物学家写了本关于郁金香的书，使这种花大受欢迎，他自家的花园也因此屡遭劫掠，很多人想方设法偷窃郁金香的球茎。 随着“荷兰黄金时代”的发展，郁金香也越来越受追捧，成为那一时期绘画和节庆的常见主题。到了17世纪中期，郁金香球茎的价格被哄抬为天价，是一名普通手工艺者年收入的很多倍。以致于郁金香球茎一度被当作货币使用，最后市场终于崩溃，导致历史上第一例经济泡沫的产生，被称为“郁金香泡沫”。 如今，当资产价格偏离了内在价值导致经济泡沫时，人们也常用“郁金香泡沫”来称呼。是不是听着耳熟？没错，有不少人也把加密货币或比特币引发的热潮比作“郁金香泡沫”。当然也有人持有不同观点。我不是这方面的专家，但是时间自会给出结论。 因为这篇文章参加“白花”主题的摄影活动和月旦评摄影，所以我没有贴很多库肯霍夫公园的其他色彩斑斓的鲜花，以后我会在关于旅游攻略的帖子里再一起分享。 你最喜欢什么花呢？听说过“郁金香泡沫”吗？欢迎留言评论。下次见！=） Thank you for reading.

Here, nature takes over. The silk-cotton and strangler fig trees have been growing over and through the stone structures. These untamed trees are telling visitors the stories of LIFE. Their clutches are seeking any slight chance of LIFE, and at the same time, they are devouring the LIFE of some ancient buildings. 每一年，几百万世界各地的游客涌向柬埔寨的丛林，来到塔普伦寺观赏这大自然和人类杰作之间上演的生死剧目。而这里，显然是大自然占了上风。 一棵棵绞杀榕和木棉树沿着石柱石墙疯狂生长，盘根错节，有些甚至野蛮地穿过石块的缝隙，将其撑裂。这些植物向世人展示着生存的顽强，同时也残酷地吞噬着这些古老石庙的生命。 Yes it is a very touristic place, just like Machu Picchu and the Great Wall, small chance that you can escape the large crowds, and this reclamation of the jungle has been photographed millions of times. Still, it is one of the most atmospheric and mesmerizing temples I visited, and I added another 20 shots to the millions’ count. ;) 这里就跟长城、马丘比丘之类的著名景点一样总是人山人海，这种丛林向人类建筑求生存的场景也被拍摄过很多次。但是，这里清幽神秘的气氛依然与很多别的寺庙不同，所以我也狂拍了二十张左右的照片。 I didn’t feel the Indiana Jones or the Tomb Raider vibe here, like many said. I just got lost a dozen times wandering through the maze, because of the distraction of the LIFE show and my legendary sense of directions. 我倒并没有感受到很多西方游客说的《印第安纳琼斯》或《古墓丽影》的氛围，只是在这迷宫似的古寺和丛林间迷路了十几次。原因？我忘了自己可怕的方向感，只顾着惊叹于这场生死剧了。 Ta Prohm was built as a Mahayana Buddhist monastery and university in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. It is close to the even more famous Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom. You can visit it as part of the small circuit of the Angkor complex. Its entrance is reachable by tuk tuk, or by a scooter/motorcycle like we did. 塔普伦寺是十二世纪晚期十三世纪早期修建起来的大乘佛教寺院和学堂，就在更加有名的吴哥寺（小吴哥）和大吴哥城附近。一般可以和吴哥建筑群“小圈”的其他景点一起游玩。通常人们所说的“吴哥窟”其实是一个很大的分散的建筑群。“小圈”的景点除了刚提到的塔普伦寺和最有名的吴哥寺，还有通王城、巴肯山、托玛侬神庙、周萨神庙和茶胶寺。一般可以坐当地常见的三轮车前往，但是我觉得像我们那样自己骑电动车或摩托车会更加灵活方便，在各个地方想停多久都可以随心安排。 That’s it for today’s tale of life.

Pretty often we underestimate the power of a smile, the gorgeous curve that sets everything straight. Have you ever had the experience that someone’s lovely smile just brightens your day? It happened to me a lot in daily life and during my travels. Here are 4 portrait photos of SMILE I clicked on the road, with my old friend Canon Kiss X3. They are not composed photo shoots in studios or such settings, so I’m not sure if they are qualified for the Portrait Contest hosted by @jasonrussell, but I’d love to share these contagious smiles. Smile more, frown less! 在这里分享几张旅途中拍到的当地人微笑的肖像。祝大家笑口常开！:D A Smiling Hamer Woman and Her Baby This woman is from the Hamer tribe, in Omo Valley in the south of Ethiopia. I didn’t focus only on her smiling face, as I also wanted to show her baby, her traditional braided hair, the highly decorative accessories she was wearing, and a glimpse of her living environment. The marital collar on her neck indicates that she is the first wife. Her beaded necklaces and metal bracelets are distinctive from that region. 这位抱着孩子微笑的哈马族女性正站在自家的草屋前。她脖子上独特的金属粗项链表明她是第一任妻子。没错，这个原始部落的男人就是这么任性，想娶几个娶几个，只要拥有足够多头牛当聘礼…… Three Smiling Ethiopian Kids I took this photo in a village near Turmi, Ethiopia. I was strolling the streets of the village when these cute kids came to me to say hello. They were quite curious about me, this strange outsider, just as I was curious about their community and culture. They tried to talk to me in loads of funny gestures they just improvised, and they were wearing the big smile on their face through our communication. I don’t think we understood everything from each other, but no worries there, all people smile in the same language. 这张照片是我在埃塞俄比亚南部图米附近的一个小村庄拍的。我当时在街上漫无目的地闲逛，这些可爱的孩子看到我这个异样的外族人，都跑过来争先恐后地跟我打招呼。一个个手舞足蹈，脸上绽放出快乐无比的笑容，我的心情也变得灿烂起来。 他们对我充满好奇，正如我对他们的村落和文化充满好奇一样。我们都开心地笑着，打着各种手势试图和对方交流，虽然并不能完全互相理解，但是这又有什么关系呢？各族语言不同，却有着共同的语言：微笑。 A Smiling Syrian Girl Feeding A Cat https://steemitimages.com/DQmWYGw3shQcy5h36setkXtKt2JKUvKnpPHAUHJwz7kbd4Y/IMG_3002.JPG I was walking on a street in Istanbul that day and captured this beautiful loving moment. The street vendor nearby told me this is a Syrian refugee girl who is sometimes seen begging for food on that street, and I was lucky to witness her feeding a cat with the food she just got. 那天我在土耳其伊斯坦布尔的街头闲逛，目睹并记录下了这温情的一幕。旁边的小贩告诉我这个小女孩是叙利亚过来的难民，有时来这条街乞讨，而我恰好看到她轻轻抚摸着一只小猫，用乞讨来的食物喂它的场面。 Smiling Kichwa Women in Ecuador I met these Kichwa women in the small village of Quilotoa in the Ecuadorean Andes, next to a huge volcanic crater lake. They were all wearing the traditional hat, and they were chatting happily with gorgeous smile on their face. I greeted them in Spanish and found out that they were talking in Kichwa/Quichua, an Ecuador variety of Quechuan languages, a native South American language family spoken primarily in the Andean mountainous regions. These indigenous people are descendants of the Incas, the largest of the 13 indigenous communities in Ecuador. 那天去厄瓜多尔中部的Quilotoa火山湖，在旁边的同名小镇上遇到照片中这些Kichwa原住民。我用破烂的西班牙语跟她们打招呼问好，她们腼腆地笑着回应。然后她们几个人开心地聊天的时候，我突然意识到人家是说自己方言而不是西班牙语的。她们的土话叫Kichwa/Quichua, 是南美原住民语系Quechua的一个分支。 At last, greetings from smiling me in front of the National Museum of the Republic in Brasília. =) 最后，来张巴西首都共和国博物馆前的微笑自拍： Thank you for reading.

It’s not that typical satay dish of Southeast Asia, which I will show you another time. Used to be called Fried Rice Queen by my co-workers, I always cook this lunch for a workday when it’s short of time and ingredients. Of course you can also fry the rice(better leftover rice as it’s drier and non-sticky) with other sauces/vegetables or without any sauce. I add meat cubes or sausage slices too when they are available. It’s simple, fast, tasty and pretty healthy. What else do you ask for? ;) So let’s get started! 今天来个最容易的炒饭分享，这里我不是要说怎么做那种南洋常见的沙嗲酱配肉串（这个下次聊），而是用现成的沙嗲酱来炒个蔬菜和剩饭（颗粒更分明，干爽不粘腻）。=) 因为非常简单粗暴快捷方便，我常常炒饭带去公司当午餐，被同事戏称为“炒饭女王” ;)。下面是我身边现有的原料，换成其他蔬菜也可以，比如蘑菇、青豆、西葫芦、玉米粒、胡萝卜等。加点鸡肉、猪肉、牛肉丁，或香肠、虾仁也很美味！ 步骤： 先用大葱和洋葱爆过的热油炒鸡蛋（鸡蛋液里加点盐和黄酒调味），再入米饭一起大火快炒，加点盐和白胡椒粉（辣椒和鸡精可选，我有时候还加点耗油或姜黄粉，味道也不错）。最后加入黄瓜粒、豆芽和花生，这里可以再依个人口味加入喜欢的酱料（见下图），迅速翻炒一下就可以出锅啦！ Ingredients##Here’s the ingredients I used. Just use whatever vegetables you have at hand, such as mushrooms, zucchini, corns, carrots, peas…I used cucumber and bean sprouts this time simply because I found these 2 in the fridge. :) ## Preparation## Stir the eggs with a bit salt and Chinese yellow cooking wine(optional). Mince the shallot onion, scallions(or chives/ciboulette) and chilies. Dice the cucumber into cubes. ## Flame on!## First, sauté the minced onions and scallions in cooking oil. Leave the chilies for later (or never if you can’t bear the heat ;p), since they can get very hot and burned if fried too early. Fry the stirred eggs in the onion&amp;scallion flavored oil and scramble them. When the scrambled eggs are almost done, add rice and toss to mix well. Stir fry shortly in high heat, along with salt and white pepper (you can add turmeric powder or oyster sauce too). At last, add the cucumber cubes, bean sprouts and peanuts, as they are not supposed to be cooked too much. ##If you feel like eating something fresh, then it’s finished at this step (the photo above). Or you can add satay sauce and more chilies in the next step like I did. (Sorry I forgot to take a photo of the sauce, ;p it’s just that kind of jarred one from Lee Kum Kee, which is easy to find in an Asian supermarket.) Keep stir-frying: 喜欢清淡一点口味的，到上面这一步就可以了。我是个无可救药的重口味，所以又加了沙爹酱和辣椒️。继续翻炒均匀： That’s it. Enjoy! :D 好了，开吃吧！ ##Do you like fried rice? What do you usually cook as lunch to bring to your work space? Feel free to share your comments! Until next time. 怎么样？你喜欢这种宇宙无敌简单的炒饭不？你一般做什么吃的带去工作？欢迎留言分享。下次见！=) Thank you for reading.

It is connecting the two parts of the pretty town Mostar. Stari Most literally means “Old Bridge”, it is an iconic landmark in the country, usually seen as one of the most significant Balkan Islamic architectures. I enjoyed visiting these distinctive architectures here as well as in other Balkans such as Albania, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Kosovo… When I was traveling in this region, whenever I read a travel map of sights, there had always been this bridge on it. So I talked to some Bosnians, and they told me that the bridge is seen as a symbol of peace nowadays, as it was destroyed in 1993 by Croat military forces during the Croat–Bosniak War. It’s said that among local people, there is an old tradition that 16-year-old boys are encouraged to plummet 24m off the bridge, into the Neretva river down below. And this cruelly(to me) brave act has become more and more popular among tourists. There is even a diving club charging tourists if they want to jump. It’s a pity that I didn’t get to see any people taking this challenge to jump into that chilly abyss, otherwise I might have clicked some more appealing shots with a diving figure in them. ;) Stari Most was first built in 16th century by a well-known architect Mimar Sinan who built many major Ottoman Sultan’s buildings in Istanbul. It stood there for over 4 centuries until the Croat–Bosniak War. The reconstruction was finished in 2004 when the bridge was reopen to the public. My first 2 photos are entries for the B &amp; W photo contest by @daveks. I used my old camera Canon Kiss X3. So what do you think of these shots and the bridge?

Today I would love to share with you some “framed” photos from my travels, inspired by the photo fun challenge by @claudiaz. 今天来和大家分享几张旅途中拍摄的自带边框的照片。 Casa dos Contos - Ouro Preto, Brazil I took this first photo with my phone in Casa dos Contos (House of Tales), a museum in the charming colonial town Ouro Preto in Brazil. The window framed the beautiful street view outside, making it an interesting shot for me. Casa dos Contos is centrally located in Ouro Preto, by the historic Tiradentes Square filled with fine Baroque colonial architectures. When I entered it on a gloomy day, the only other visitors were a group of school kids lead by a teacher. But apparently those pupils were not so interested in the exhibition, as they were taking selfies all the time with their phones. ;) I will share this funny scene one day in my future post. According to the pictures displayed inside the museum, this huge historic building used to house the elite, the troops, the prisoners and others in different periods of history. It was restored and turned to a museum in 1983, and it’s free to enter. Now it’s displaying documentary exhibits about the Mint and the Central Bank of Brazil, as well as other cultural presentations such as furniture, documents and books from the 18th and 19th centuries. I found this beautiful old building a hidden gem, just like the city of Ouro Preto, which was the most populous city in the New World in the 18th century because of the gold rush. Ouro Preto was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980 and is well-known in Brazil, but a bit off the radar and path of foreign tourists. Most visitors here were Brazilians, or Spanish speakers from the same continent who could understand a lot Portuguese. So very few locals speak English or Spanish, and I was struggling to get by with my crappy Spanish, which was a fun experience for me! :D 第一张照片是在巴西小城Ouro Preto市中心的一个博物馆向窗外拍到的街景。我所在的这座殖民风格的老楼有着多姿多彩的过去：在历史上的不同时期曾经是名流聚会之地、军队指挥官指点江山的场所、关押犯人的监狱……1983年的时候被改建成博物馆，名字的意思是“有故事的房子”，展出18到19世纪的家具、书籍、照片、货币等饱经沧桑的历史物件。从我的照片上可以看到，窗外那些建于殖民地时期的巴洛克风格的房子和教堂在阴雨中也是别有一番风味。 Ouro Preto在葡萄牙语里的意思是“黑金城”，因为这里是殖民时期的淘金重镇，18世纪时，就有800多吨黑金被从这里运往宗主国葡萄牙。就像南美很多因采矿而发迹的小城一样，黑金城一度成为18世纪整个新世界人口最多的地方，连彼时的纽约人口也只有它的一半。如今虽然不再有黑色的金子可淘，却因出产色彩斑斓的宝石而著称, 是帝王玉的原产地。 这里的殖民建筑保存得也很完整，1980年成为巴西第一个被列为世界文化遗产的古镇。在巴西国内名气挺大，但是外国游客不是很多，我去博物馆的当天，只在里面见到一个由当地老师带领的小学生团，而那些小学生们显然并没有对展览很感兴趣，而是都在忙着用手机各种自拍，有机会我会发发这些孩子的照片，实在让人忍俊不禁。 由于这里的游客大都是巴西人或南美其他国家的西班牙语使用者（他们对听懂看懂同为拉丁语系的葡萄牙语没什么大问题），本地人也就很少说除了母语外的其他语言。这对我来说可是个不小的打击啊，英语自然是用不上，破烂的西班牙语也不足以让我猜测出飞快的葡语的意思。所以，这种原汁原味的旅行真是一种有意思的折磨，痛并快乐着。 Playa de la Concha -San Sebastián, SpainBosphorus Bridge -Istanbul, Turkey ## https://steemitimages.com/DQmSZXDh6kLyPQGRefLW9df8Ug5sXaqJiL1faSxkMMhKq5M/IMG_30251.jpg ##The views in these 2 pictures are both framed by the fence in front of me. When shooting the first photo, I focused on the white fence to show its intricate flowery pattern. While for the second photo, I focused on the famous bridge behind as the fence is pretty common. 上面这两张照片都是利用面前的栏杆作为边框。拍第一张时，聚焦在了白色的栏杆上，以突出精美的雕花图案。而拍第二张时，把焦点对在了后面有名的大桥上。 ##The “framed” picture on the left was taken in San Sebastián, north of Spain. This pretty town is known for its beaches framed by a bayfront promenade where I shot this photo. Through the white fence, you can see the picturesque Bahía de la Concha (literally The Shell Bay due to its shape of a “shell” ) and the Isla de Santa Clara (the island in distance). The beaches here are incredibly crowded since it’s a popular resort town, but what attracts me the most is its plenty bars and restaurants serving a great varieties of delicious pintxos(bite-size snacks from Basque Country, similar to tapas) and other innovative regional specialties. 上面左边的照片拍于西班牙北部的巴斯克重镇圣塞巴斯蒂安。这座精致的古城以月牙形的海湾著称。我这张照片就是在海滩边的滨海道上拍的。白色的栏杆框住了后面的“贝壳湾”和圣克拉拉小岛的美景。 由于圣塞巴斯蒂安是欧洲有名的度假胜地，这里的海滩也是人山人海。不过这里最吸引我的反正也不是海滩，而是遍布古城的巴斯克美食！除了花样繁多、便宜可口的pintxos（类似西班牙tapas的开胃小菜），这里还聚集着一批世界顶级的大厨，不断推出各种创意美食，在全球美食界占有一席之地。 ##The second picture was clicked in Istanbul, Turkey. The bridge framed by the fence is the 15 July Martyrs Bridge or the better known Bosphorus Bridge. This First Bridge is one of the three suspension bridges spanning the Bosphorus strait which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara. Bosphorus strait is a strategic waterway and natural boundary between Asia and Europe. So Bosphorus Bridge is connecting Asian Turkey and European Turkey. One city spans 2 continents, pretty cool right? I experienced this also in Russia which I will talk about in my future post, and I would love to visit Atyrau in Kazakhstan one day, another city spanning Asia and Europe. 右边的照片是在土耳其的伊斯坦布尔拍的。栏杆后的大桥就是有名的博斯普鲁斯大桥，横跨同名海峡，连接土耳其的欧洲和亚洲两部分。这样一座横跨欧亚两洲的城市是不是很酷？曾经在俄罗斯也有经历这样的一城跨两洲，以后会渐渐渐渐地在某一天聊到 ;)。据说哈萨克斯坦的阿特劳市也是这样：欧亚两洲的界河乌拉尔河穿城而过，将其一分为二。希望以后有机会去看看。 So that’s it about some “framed” photos in my travels.

I visited this abandoned place in my epic Atacama trip, after seeing La Portada near the regional capital of Antofagasta. At the old Baquedano train station, in the extreme heat and dryness, I walked around the abandoned railway complex with a locomotive arsenal, wagon storage yards, a roundhouse and turntable, warehouses, and other services. The roundhouse here can still accommodate up to 16 locomotives. Baquedano was a small town founded in 1910 around its railway works, as the converging point of Chile’s North-South railway line and the East-West Antofagasta-Bolivia Railway. The railway started in 1866 mainly to carry minerals from inland of Bolivia to the port of Antofagasta. Until the late 1970s when the steam locomotives was giving way to diesel engines, the station eventually fell into disuse, but it still remains in fairly good condition today.

Until next time. 在智利北部茫茫的阿塔卡马大沙漠中，有一个不太知名的火车墓场。先来说下阿塔卡马沙漠，这个地球上自然环境最接近火星的世界“旱极”，有些区域几十年甚至数百年都没下过雨，很多地方寸草不生。终年艳阳高照，天常常是蓝得不含一丝白云。可想而知这里的白天有多热，紫外线有多强。我那个新年假期在这广袤的大沙漠从南到北，又从北到南晃荡了十几天，完全被烤成了黑人。 继续看沙漠中的这个位于Baquedano的火车墓场。Baquedano这个小镇成形于1910年，由于这里是智利南北火车线路和太平洋沿岸到邻国玻利维亚的东西走向列车的交汇点，一切都围绕火车站建设发展起来。铁路始建于1866年，当时主要为了把玻利维亚内陆的矿产运送到智利位于太平洋的港口城市安托法加斯塔。 到了20世纪70年代晚期，蒸汽机车由于高昂的花费逐渐被内燃机引擎所替代，这些火车和站点也日渐废弃。如今，我在这片荒凉干热的土地上四处走动，看着这些年久失修的引擎、车厢、仓库、铁路机车的转台等，想到一百多年前那如火如荼、热火朝天的景象，不禁唏嘘感慨岁月变迁、世事变幻的莫测沧桑…… 下一贴会有更多历史背景、原色照片和细节内容，敬请期待！=）你对这些废弃的火车有什么看法？看到过废弃的车辆、住宅、厂房、矿场之类的吗？欢迎留言评论。下次再见！ Thank you for reading.

The street performer was playing saxophone here almost every day when I passed by.And one day, a baby seemed to be mesmerized by his performance. He looked at the busker deep into his eyes, listening attentively with great interest. The performer seemed to be moved by his soulmate as well, and was playing hard with even more emotion and enthusiasm. ##这是我在丹麦首都哥本哈根街头捕捉到的一个画面，该画面生动地讲述了一个“酒逢知己千杯少”的故事。这位街头艺人几乎每天都在同一地点吹奏萨克斯风。有一天，当我经过他身边时，突然看到这样一副感人至深的场景。我觉得这个故事几乎不需要过多语言的修饰，这种惺惺相惜简直不言自明，不是吗？;) ## Here’s another snapshot of buskers and a kid at the New Harbor of Copenhagen. This kid is not acting like a soulmate, but is trying to take the performers’ hard-earned coins out of the hat. Hmmm… sad story. 再来一张哥本哈根的街头随拍，同样是艺人和小孩的故事。只是这孩子并没有前面一个那么贴心，他专心致志地蹲在那里，琢磨着怎么把这些艺人辛苦演奏挣来的收入给抢走。这，是一个让人有点心酸的故事。;) 你觉得呢？ ##All content by @itchyfeetdonica.

There were also roses in yellow, orange, lilac, and a wide varieties of red in different tints and shades. https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmShi8x6o3ZiBCohGF32XLJpQA5YdJ4Qj3YGuL8HLQ2AwS/106177A4-551D-4EE2-BD51-DE4A2FE09931.jpegDifferent colors are said to carry varied connotations. Pink roses are symbolic of grace, elegance and admiration. White roses are associated with innocence, purity and loyalty. Red roses are a widely known symbol of love, passion and courage. But I constantly heard different versions from the rose sellers. I don’t really care what each color means, all colors are appealing to me ;). ##Earliest roses are known to have grown 35 million-years ago, and from ancient Egyptian tombs, petrified rose wreaths have been unearthed. In Greek mythology, Aphrodite, Goddess of Love, is said to have created the rose. According to the poet Anacreon, sea foam dripping from her newborn body turned into white roses; thus symbolizing her innocence and purity. Later, her wounded lover Adonis’ blood was shed onto a white rose, and the red rose represented her desire and passion. The Romans, with their counterpart Goddess of Love - Venus, also adopted the rose as a symbol of love and beauty. Cupid offered a rose to bribe the God of Silence to hush his mother Venus’s affairs. And when he shot arrows at bees which had stung him, thorns grew from the rose stems where the bees were missed. There’s even The War of the Roses. In this civil war in England in the 15th century, the House of York adopted a white rose, while the House of Lancaster chose a red rose. At last, the winner - Tudor Henry VII created the Tudor Rose by merging his Lancastrian rose with the red rose of his York bride. This Rose is also known as the Rose of England. ##So what do you think of the significance of a rose? Which color is your favorite? Feel free to share your comments! The head image is my entry for the 4th week of #Rosesopenweekend contest hosted by @adrianobalan. Check out this exclusive contest about Rose if you are interested. =) ##这两张照片里的玫瑰花是我先后在比利时安特卫普的一个鲜花市场里买的。在古希腊神话中，玫瑰就集爱神与美神于一身，直到今天都是广受大家好像更多是女性喜爱的一种花。西方国家还有很多女孩子的名字就直接用玫瑰这个词。 从植物学的角度来看，玫瑰（Rosa rugosa）、月季（Rosa chinensis）和蔷薇（Rosa multiflora）都是蔷薇属（Rosa）的植物。而在英文里都统称Rose，真是为我这种眼盲省去了好多辨别的麻烦。对我来说，最容易区别的就是颜色，而不是什么茎、叶、花瓣之类的细微差别（长吁一口气……）。 我这里拍的两种颜色都比较淡雅，当然也有其他鲜艳的颜色，比如黄色，橙色，丁香色，还有最常见的深浅浓淡不同的各种红色，每种颜色又被人类赋予各自的花语，含义还随着花朵数量有所变化。但是除了众所周知的红玫瑰代表挚爱和热情，其他颜色的花语我看到好多版本，可能很多时候取决于卖花的怎么说吧，呵呵。一般认为粉色寓意优雅、关怀和敬意，白色象征纯洁、真诚和忠心。 ##你最喜欢哪种颜色的玫瑰/月季/蔷薇？欢迎留言评论，谢谢关注！ :D Thank you for reading.

Yesterday I cooked Braised Pork with Tofu and Shiitake mushrooms. It’s so delicious and I would love to share its recipe with you! So let’s get started: Ingredients##Except for the pork belly(or chopped ribs), shiitake mushrooms and tofu(the harder type), you will need these in the picture below. And also rice, cooking oil, sugar, and sesame(optional, for the garnish on rice at last). ## Flame on!## First, sauté sugar in cooking oil over medium heat until it’s turning brown. Put pork into the wok and fry it with the brown sugar to get colored. Add Chinese cooking wine, and stir fry pork with sliced ginger and star anise. Leave the pork being cooked for 10 minutes, meanwhile slice shiitake mushrooms and cube tofu. Add shiitake, tofu, soy sauce and salt into the wok. (I looove chilies, but they are optional of course) Stir fry everything on high heat for 1 minute. Add a bit water and cover the wok with lid, let it braise over low-medium heat for 10 minutes. That’s it! Garnish with sesame and chives. Enjoy this succulent pork dish with jasmine rice!  ## 步骤：先炒糖色，入五花肉上色，加入料酒、姜片和大茴，翻炒10分钟左右。同时香菇切片、豆腐切块，加入锅中和肉、酱油、盐一起翻炒均匀（爱吃辣的加干辣椒），最后沿锅边加点水，焖10分钟左右。香菇豆腐红烧肉就做好啦。赶紧出锅享用这绝世佳肴吧！ ## Behind the scenes:When I went to the back yard to cut chives, this cow suddenly came close and started mooing… He might be mouth-watering over the divine dish. ;)After lunch on Sunday, I turned the left rice into porridge, and ate it later with the leftover pork for dinner. Yuuummmm… 幕后花絮：左图 —— 我去后院剪小葱时，只见这头奶牛凑将过来，朝我叫唤了几声，估计是被锅中焖着的红烧肉给吸引过来的？右图 —— 星期天中午吃剩的米饭，加水煮成黄瓜粥，就着吃剩的香菇豆腐红烧肉和自制辣椒酱，简直是人间美味啊…… https://steemitimages.com/DQmbWSErFKkz85AWHrZMvEMtsdrukjkS47SQbSwtQvn6uy6/IMG_7902.JPGhttps://steemitimages.com/DQmSkaidmPy93VAVQweVDTtjoSzftQKkwQwSQhxUGEhUjYf/IMG_7970.JPG ##Do you like this Braised Pork with Tofu and Shiitake?

Today, the house is part of the Atlanta History Center and is maintained as a historic house museum. The Inmans was the wealthiest family in Georgia in the post-Civil War “New South” era. They made a fortune from cotton business and by investing on banking, transportation and real estate. Edward Inman also served in several local elected positions. 这些照片里的老房子是我在美国佐治亚州的亚特兰大历史中心拍的。这座天鹅屋建于1928年，是爱德华和艾米莉夫妇的住宅。爱德华所在的英曼家族是美国内战后“新南方”时代最富有的人家。通过棉花经纪，还有对银行、交通运输和地产的投资，英曼家族积累了大量财富。不仅经商，爱德华还当选了本地的官员。 He and his wife Emily hired an architectural firm to design a house on a land of 28 acres in Buckhead where they could grow old together. The principal architect Philip Schutze drew on classical elements as inspiration for this house and its gardens. He adapted Italian and English classical styles to accommodate the living of that time. This beautiful mansion was completed at the end of the Jazz Age, a period of wealth, freedom and exuberance, and a time when new styles of music and dance emerged. Just a few months later in 1929, the Great Depression started. And it’s followed by a disaster for the family. In 1931, the husband died at 49. Fairy tale does not really exist, and life has to go on. After that, his wife Emily, a suffragette and society matriarch, lived there with their son and ran the house, the finances and the family until 1965. The following year, the house and grounds were acquired by the Atlanta Historical Society. 20世纪20年代的美国正处于“爵士时代” ，这是一个财富丰盈、自由奔放的时代，这是一个新式舞蹈和音乐不断涌现而出的时代。完工于1928年末的天鹅屋，勉强抓住了这一时期的尾巴。可惜好景不长，几个月后，美国便开始了“经济大萧条”时期。两年后的1931年，厄运也降临到了爱德华和艾米莉的小家庭，丈夫49岁便突然离开人世。这对夫妇原打算在占地28公顷的天鹅庄园里白头偕老，怎奈现实终究不是童话，王子和公主无法再一起幸福终老。然而，生活还是要继续。妻子艾米莉，这位走在时代前列的妇女参政论者，开始独当一面，操持家中一切大小事务，带着儿子和一帮佣人继续在天鹅屋住到了1965年。艾米莉去世后的第二年，亚特兰大历史协会收购了整个天鹅庄园，后来又经过修复，成为历史房屋博物馆向公众展出。 I toured the house and grounds, and discovered the many original furnishings as well as the Schutze arts collection. Except for a wide range of old objects from Europe, there was also a big black screen from East Asia (see the pictures). It’s truly an interesting experience for me to explore the house’s four floors, soaking in all the history. 爱德华夫妇聘请的主要建筑师菲利普· 舒茨将意大利和英国建筑的古典元素加以创新，运用到天鹅屋和花园的设计上。我在整个老房子的四层楼间穿梭，细细观赏这些原汁原味的古旧家具物件和建筑师收集的艺术品，其中除了很多来自旧大陆欧洲的物品，还有来自东方的装饰屏风（如图）。 I met the historical characters in the big house who shared with me their own stories at that time. They were performed by costumed interpreters. Mr. Inman, a man full of character, expressed his opinions about 1920s business and politics. The architect Philip Shutze showed me his decorative arts collection in the basement. Ruby Ross Wood from New York was decorating the whole house for the family. The African American chauffeur drove Mr. Inman and shared a racing seat next to his employer. The maid, Emma Jean told me about her work and her daily life. Pretty cool, right? It felt like a journey to the past in a time machine! :) 老房子里还有装扮成主人公的工作人员给参观者讲述当年各自的故事，就像乘坐时光机器穿越到上世纪20年代，是不是很有意思？“英曼先生”是个个形鲜明的角色，他结合自己的经历，向我表达了自己对20年代美国商业、政治的看法；“建筑师菲利普”带我去地下室参观了他搜集的装饰艺术品；来自纽约的“露比”负责装扮整个天鹅屋；“非裔美国司机”平时开车接送“英曼先生”，赛车时就坐在主人旁边；“女佣艾玛”向我描述了她的日常生活和劳作。 At the kitchen door, I discovered lots of tools for cooking, cleaning, dusting, polishing and washing. The maids, gardener, butler, chauffeur and other servants used to enter the house from here. This kind of lifestyle based on servants was characteristic of Atlanta’s elite during the 1920s and 1930s. Like walking around in a movie setting, I took this chance to peek into their daily chores inside and outside the house. And this old mansion was indeed used to film some scenes, such as the 2013 film The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and 2 years later in its sequel, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 2. Looks familiar now? :) 在厨房的门后，我还发现一堆烹饪器具和清洁除尘、洗涤、抛光等用品。这里是管家、司机、园丁和女佣们的入口。这些帮佣在上世纪20到30年代的亚特兰大富人家庭里很常见。我感觉自己仿佛身在电影场景之中，想象着这些人物当年忙里忙外的生活琐细。而这座天鹅庄园还真的被用来拍摄过电影，比如2013年的电影《饥饿游戏2：星火燎原》和2015年的续集《饥饿游戏：自由幻梦》。如果你看过这两部电影，应该会觉得这座老房子很眼熟吧？=） ##So that’s it for today’s story about Swan House.

I took a couple of trains from Moscow all the way to Ulaanbaatar and explored the surrounds. The park is about 2 hours’ drive from the capital city Ulaanbaatar. I hiked in this beautiful huge park and spent one night in a typical Mongolian ger camp in the valley, by the clear Tuul River. When I hiked(half-climbed) to a hilltop in the valley, I found this pretty little yellow poppy standing in the wild. The view in the second picture is also from this hilltop. ## The Poppy Flowers ##The first poppy flowers I’ve seen in my life were red ones, like the well-known symbol of Remembrance that people often worn on November 11th each year. When I lived in Belgium, I visited Ypres in west Flanders - where the red poppies were blossoming as in the devastated battlefields in the First World War. The red color of the poppies is like the soldiers’ blood soaking the ground. In 1915, a Canadian doctor and commander, John McCrae lost his friend in the battle in Ypres, and he was inspired by the red poppies in the fields to write the poem - ‘In Flanders Fields’. There is also the Himalayan blue poppy. These rare blue poppies are native to the high Himalayan Mountains, and are difficult to grow. The Opium &amp; China ##So you must have heard of opium? Among the many varieties of poppies, the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) , as you can see from its name, has the highest concentration of narcotics, and is illegal to grow in many countries. Opium has been used for medical purpose, and poppy seeds are regarded as a great food source.The cultivation of opium poppy are believed to be spread along the Silk Road, from the Mediterranean all the way to China in the 15th century. The opium played a special role in Chinese history, as it was the catalyst for the 2 Opium Wars in the mid-19th century. Britain smuggled Indian opium to China through the East India Company for the Chinese produced tea. This did not only lead to the warfare, but also resulted in the Chinese’s heavy addiction to opium, which lasted till 20th century and spreaded to overseas.In fact, my grandma’s father died from overdose of opium. He was so addicted to smoking that he had to sell everything valuable at home to keep buying opium. Eventually, the rich landlord lost all his assets, as well as his life. I heard this sad story from my grandma, and I believe it’s only one of the many tragedies happened in Chinese families during that period.The immigrants from China also brought opium smoking to America through gold rush and railroad work. As a result, opium dens became a common sight in the Chinatowns from San Francisco to the east coast of US. Terelj National Park https://steemitimages.com/DQmSTh6Gdh8UEhNKnD5FWLWBD6X6EP6PNwfY9DrjniEnLHQ/Mongolia2.JPGIf you ever come to this amazing park in Mongolia, you can hike to the glacial lake, Khagiin Khar Lake and the natural hot springs, visit a Buddhist monastery on a hilltop, ride horses on the steppe, watch the wildlife such as Eastern Buzzard(I saw plenty hovering over my head), brown bears(I didn’t get to see any)… If you like rock climbing, try out the many rock formations, like Turtle Rock and the Praying Lama Rock. I also learned cooking lamb from the host family, and watched locals wrestling. I will do a photo journal of this trip in another post, since this post is mainly about the poppy flower, inspired by Yellow Flower Day - The Contests of Petals by @petals.*罂粟花 我只知道这朵美丽动人的小黄花是某种罂粟花，具体是哪种并不清楚，一搜索又是一脸懵，类似前几天的玫瑰、月季和蔷薇。根据果壳网的说法，常见的罂粟科植物有“罂粟，虞美人，冰岛罂粟（野罂粟），鬼罂粟和黑环罂粟”。产鸦片的只有罂粟一种。这里有果壳网具体的图文比较 。我辨别了半天，暂且诊断这朵黄花为野罂粟吧。可能是相较欧洲的物种，亚洲的普遍偏精致？不止人类，连这来自蒙古草原的野罂粟也比样图里的冰岛罂粟娇小了一圈。 我最常见到的罂粟科的花要属虞美人了，那深深浅浅亭亭玉立的红色花朵常丛生于路边或庭园中。 说起虞美人，我国秦汉时期有霸王别姬的民间传说，清朝曾有位诗人以虞美人虞姬的口吻作诗，想象她自刎后的鲜血让江边的花儿更红： 君王意气尽江东，贱妾何堪入汉宫；碧血化为江边草,花开更比杜鹃红。 而在一站时期欧洲大陆的弗兰德斯战场，鲜红的虞美人盛放在战后满目疮痍的焦土之上，仿佛是被战士的鲜血所染红。 我曾去比利时西弗兰德斯省临近法国的伊普尔小镇参观弗兰德斯战场纪念馆。第一次世界大战期间，这个位于法比交界的重要战略地区成为同盟国和协约国争夺的焦点。伊普尔曾爆发五次战役，伤亡人数100多万。这里也是全球第一次被使用化学武器的地方。 1915年春，第二次伊普尔战役期间，加拿大军医麦克雷在佛兰德斯前线痛失战友，看着战场上在微风中摇曳的鲜红虞美人，麦克雷创作出著名的诗作《在弗兰德斯战场上》，影响深远。 诗歌的开头和结尾都提到了战场上的虞美人： 在弗兰德斯战场上，在一排排墓地的十字架旁，罂粟花儿随风飘荡，这是战友们长眠的地方；……我们将无法安息，纵使虞美人盛开在弗兰德斯的战场上。 上面是我刚翻译的，原文节选如下： In Flanders fields the poppies blowBetween the crosses, row on row,That mark our place;…We shall not sleep, though poppies growIn Flanders fields. 之后每年的11月11日一战停战纪念日，很多人会在胸前佩戴“弗兰德斯虞美人”的鲜花或者胸针来缅怀战争中逝去的同胞。 鸦片在中国 说到罂粟，不能不提鸦片。鸦片罂粟是所有罂粟科花中尼古丁含量最高的。除了药用，罂粟籽还被认为是营养美味的食材。 鸦片罂粟的种植在15世纪时从地中海沿着丝绸之路一直传到中国。19世纪中期英国大量引入中国的印度鸦片引发了战争，导致的毒瘾泛滥一直持续到了20世纪，鸦片也随着海外淘金热和铁路修筑由华工带出了中国。从旧金山到纽约，唐人街的鸦片窟曾一度如雨后春笋般遍地开花。 我常听外婆说起这段不堪回首的往事：当年她妈妈肚子里怀着她的时候，她从未谋面的爸爸就吸食鸦片成瘾，不断变卖家产去买鸦片，从阔绰的大户人家直吸到倾家荡产，还断送了性命。可能这也是当年鸦片带给千千万万中国家庭的惨剧的一个缩影吧。 特勒吉国家公园 这朵野罂粟拍于距离蒙古首都东北边约2小时车程的特勒吉国家公园。我当时从莫斯科出发，一路搭了几列火车，走走停停，渐渐穿越广袤的西伯利亚，来到乌兰巴托，在蒙古国停留了一段时间。这个大国家公园是离首都最近的自然保护区。 在这片风光秀美的土地上，有苍翠的山谷、葱郁的森林、清澈的小溪、暖心的温泉、深不见底的冰山湖、可以攀岩的奇特岩石构造、几百种鸟类（一直有亚洲秃鹰在我头顶盘旋）、灰熊（没见着踪影）、位于山顶的佛教寺庙。更关键的，还有那最具特色的白色蒙古包，和策马奔腾的蒙古汉子，只是可惜没看到帅的，还是自己在那草甸上山谷间策马奔腾比较有意思。当然也少不了在蒙古包里宿营，跟当地人聊天，看当地人摔跤，一日三餐换着花样做羊肉吃羊肉，吃到以后看见羊肉就发怵。 这里有趣的故事太多，只是这篇的主题是“黄花”，所以下次我再放送一波照片和介绍。欢迎各位关注留言，感谢阅读！ Thank you for reading.

This mosque is one of the most important ones in this country, and it’s located at the Kampong Glam precinct which is a focal area of Singapore’s Muslim Community. The first two pictures below are mural art about making Teh Tarik, tea and coffee. Teh Tarik is a common milk tea drink in Malaysia and Singapore, as well as some other Southeast Asian countries. Teh(tea) Tarik(pull) refers to the pouring process of “pulling” the beverage during preparation, as what you can see from the mural. It is made from black tea and milk(either condensed or evaporated). Tasty Teh Tarik is one of my favorite beverages, I even have instant packages at hand right now.  ##大家好！我这次分享的手机随拍都是在新加坡的苏丹回教堂和附近的街巷里。苏丹回教堂️是新加坡最重要的清真寺之一，所在的甘榜格南区也是新加坡回教徒活跃的地方。 前两张照片里的壁画描绘了拉茶、中式茶和咖啡的制作。拉茶可以说是马来西亚的国饮，在新加坡和其他一些东南亚国家也很常见。第一张照片就反映了“拉”茶的过程，一般由红茶和炼乳或淡奶混合做成。我也爱喝拉茶，香浓顺滑，超有满足感，个人感觉马来拉茶比英式的浓郁，又不像印度奶茶那么辛辣，口感恰到好处，和港式奶茶在我心中的奶茶单上并列榜首。现在我身边就有速溶包，虽然没有现拉的那么正宗好喝，好歹也可以解解馋。 你去过新加坡的苏丹回教堂吗？喜欢喝拉茶不？欢迎留言评论，谢谢关注！=) ##So have you been to Singapore and this Sultan Mosque?

But I tend to overlook the beauty where I live longer. A good example is I didn’t take many photos of Brussels when I was working there. Since I just got used to those charming streets and green parks walking by them every day. Luckily my mother came to visit me in Belgium one summer, so I showed her some parts of this beautiful city and carried my old camera with me. When we were walking on a street in the city center, the rain started pouring all of a sudden. We moved to under a roof, and just at this moment, a horse carriage ran rapidly into my sight opposite the street, so I immediately took action and captured this intriguing encounter. After seeing this shot, my mother told me it looks a bit like a movie scene. What do you think? Please tell me in the comments below!

Wax is used to block dye from penetrating the fabric, leaving unwaxed areas to the original colour to make design patterns. You can repeat the process of wax resisting and dyeing, to create elaborate multicoltred designs. In my travels, I’ve seen batik fabric frequently in Southeast Asia and South Asia, as well as in some ethnic minority villages in Guizhou province in southwest China. And in my cross-culture training work I once learned that, batik textiles have also existed for centuries in many parts of Africa, for example, the people in Yoruba tribe in Nigeria use cassava for resist dyeing while the people of Senegal use rice paste. The batik cloths are in the form of sarongs, scarves, dresses, shirts, bags, mats, coasters, tablecloths, curtains, bed sheets and are used to frame pictures or are framed as an artwork to decorate the wall. And you can be creative to apply it to more items, for instance, I’m thinking of making some jewelry out of it, such as necklaces, bracelets, rings and earrings. In this Batik Series, I’d like to talk about my encounters and experiences with batik in different countries. First, I will share with you my batik making in Indonesia, though the result turned out to be quite different than I imagined ;p. My Batik Making in Bali##Last year I joined a batik making workshop in Bali, Indonesia, and learnt some interesting lessons about batik, this intricate technique on fabric. 去年在印尼的巴厘岛参加了蜡染的手工作坊，粗浅地感受了其中一种蜡染的制作工艺，所以这篇文章打算带大家探索一下蜡染的奥妙。 那么什么是蜡染呢？实际上完整的叫法应该是“用蜡防止染色”，就是通过在布料上用热蜡勾勒出点和线，或者用刷子大面积刷上蜡，以隔断染料来保留布料原色，等蜡被除去之后，和被染色的部分一起呈现出各种花纹。只要不断重复上蜡染色的过程，就可以染出越来越精美复杂的图案。 据史书记载，靛蓝的还原技术在春秋战国时期已开始使用，而且一直沿用至今。秦汉、六朝时期蜡染工艺逐渐流行起来，到隋唐时期达到高峰。自宋代开始衰退，而同一时期在印度洋上的爪哇、苏门答腊等岛却十分盛行。这些地区的蜡染经过长期发展，如今已经成为世界范围内知名的最为系统全面的工艺。 印度尼西亚的蜡染工艺在2009年10月2日被联合国教科文组织纳入人类非物质文化遗产，印尼人也由此将10月2日定为全国巴迪克（batik）日。蜡染服装巴迪克在印尼被尊为“国服”， 印尼人在各传统，正式的场合普遍穿着巴迪克。在东南亚和南亚旅行的时候, 特别是在印尼和马来的一些村落里，经常看到人们穿着蜡染布料的衬衫和裹裙。 这次我在印尼参加的蜡染手工作坊，是由巴厘岛小有名气的一位民间蜡染艺人在自家院子里主持教授的，这位师傅从小对绘画很感兴趣，由于家境不宽裕，早早开始靠卖画卖蜡染布料为生。他家院子里挂满他的绘画和蜡染作品，画面上栩栩如生的动植物，宗教祭祀细节，乡间的农耕场景， 无不洋溢着浓郁的民族风情。 师傅告诉我最初的蜡染是在棉，麻布料上绘制图案，后来渐渐出现蚕丝、人造丝、聚酯纤维等面料。印尼蜡染的传统花色多为深浅搭配的大地色系，随着长期的技术发展和文化融合，颜色、样式、图案都逐渐多样化。传统的蜡染工艺精美繁复，但是耗时费力，价格不菲。所以近年来出现大批机制蜡染布，价格相对实惠，但自然没有手工制品那么高的艺术价值。 蜡染绘画的创作离不开蜡：蜡质的配置，蜡温的调控，还有施蜡的手法等因素，都会对画作产生影响。蜡的品类繁多，熔点也各不相同。师傅说在印尼，他们通常选用蜂蜡和石蜡作为防染的主体材料，蜂蜡和石蜡以不同比例，调制成软硬程度各异的蜡质。有些地区会添加松香、米浆、树脂、油脂等来调整材料。 1 - Heating wax2 - Practicing drawing with batik pen/canting on paper3 - Drawing a Mandala pattern with wax on the cotton canvas4 - Finished wax Mandala ##师傅一边解释一边嘱咐他儿子加热容器里的蜡，同时指导我先用铅笔勾画轮廓。因为是第一次学习蜡染，师傅提议我画个比较简单的曼陀罗（Mandala）图案，这在梵语里意思是神圣的圆轮或中心。曼陀罗图案常见于东方的印度教和藏传佛教的建筑和装饰中，在西方和拉美的书店里、地摊上也常出售各种曼陀罗图案的涂色本供人练习绘画。瑞士心理学家荣格曾研究引用曼陀罗所呈现的宇宙奥秘和个人内心潜能的联系，将其运用在心理学领域，介绍给西方人。 我们把棉布固定在木框上，然后用铅笔在棉布上打底，我从小喜欢涂涂画画有点基础，很快就在师傅的指导下勾画出曼陀罗的图案，可是接下来的上蜡就没那么容易啦。热蜡容易冷却凝固，而铜制的画刀便于保温，所以要用铜蜡刀来作画。技术熟练的艺人像这位老师傅大都是不用打底，直接用蜡刀在布面上作画。 为了避免我这个新手用蜡无情地摧毁画面，师傅递给我一本白纸，教导我先老老实实在白纸上练习使用铜蜡刀。这确实是项技术活，先用蜡刀从容器里舀装已烧热熔化的液体蜡，勾画时要尽量和纸面保持平行，停止时让笔头朝上以免液体蜡过多地流向纸面，初学者容易犯的错误就是像使用一般铅笔水笔一样，停笔时笔头朝下，这样液体蜡就会涌向纸面，导致过度蜡汁积聚在同一处，影响线条的流畅度。所以呢，当你看到一张画布上的线条被星星点点的蜡中断，肯定是出自新手，比如我。 估计是为了保持我创作的热情，师傅还不断鼓励我说画得不错，只出现少量积蜡点，在第一次尝试的学徒里算很不错的了。然后每当我暗自得意之时，就立马出现更多蜡点甚至蜡团，看来真是时刻都要集中注意力在刀尖啊。事实证明经验丰富的师傅太有先见之明了，看着面前纸上断断续续的黄蜡，好庆幸我没有直接用铜蜡刀在棉布上作画。经过几张白纸上的蜡刀描绘练习，我开始移师布面了。 5 &amp; 6 - Coloring with natural dyes made from plants7 - Brushing paraffin onto the surface after applying hydrochloric acid, paraffin, cracking and red dye8 - Dyeing the fabric in black after cracking(I was so excited and did too much cracking ;), and I won’t use red and black dyes if I have a second chance in future, as I feel these dark cracks overshadowed the Mandala.) 首先要不断去舀热蜡，用蜡勾勒完线条便开始涂色。这里用的染料都是天然植物制成。值得注意的是，这里涂上的颜色并不是布料最终的颜色，因为刷上盐酸和蜡后还会变色。这些真理其实是我后来才领悟到的，到最后看到成品的颜色才后悔莫及…… 因为师傅带着浓重口音的有限英语实在很难交流，而我当然也不会当地话，所以只能被动接受指示。 我上完颜色后，给正反面刷几遍盐酸来固色，刷时看到圆圈内的白色变成湖蓝色，我顿觉不妙，怎么颜色变成这样了，始料未及啊。师傅看我动作放缓，就自己去用大刷子蘸水狂刷了一通。 然后指导我刷石蜡，用手掰出裂纹。接着刷红色染料，继续重复刷石蜡，做裂纹，最后刷一遍黑色染料。有点后悔听从师傅用红黑染料的指示，而且因为我第一次操作蜡染，太过兴奋，掰出过度裂纹，导致最后弄出颜色和纹理十分可怕的成品，跟我想象中的清新淡雅的花布完全不同。 师傅的儿子帮忙拆下木框后，我们把刷过蜡和红黑染料的饱经摧残的画布浸入温水以熔化蜡 ，反复漂洗几遍，使残留的黄蜡脱净，最后将湿布晒干，就大功告成啦。 下图12这块布料就是颜色可怖裂纹过度的成品，还请大家不要嫌弃，凑合着看看吧。:D 如果不是亲手做出来的，我真恨不得扔掉啊，太碍眼了。好笑的是，师傅还一个劲儿地夸赞这颜色组合很好，哈哈，好吧，难道这还是印尼审美中的精品？可爱的读者们，你们觉得呢？ 09 - Removing canvas from frame10 - Melting wax of the fabric in warm water11 - Take the fabric out after all the wax is gone12 - Dry it in the sun ☀️ The end product turned out to be pretty deep in color, and too much cracking had been done. This is different than the neat result I imagined earlier when painting. A lesson learnt… ;) w(ﾟДﾟ)w So what do you think of my first batik work?

Pretty cool right? at a hostel on the Chiloe island, Chile  用木头货盘和树干改造成的凳子，还有中间的旧窗户用来作茶几，创意又环保♻️，是不是很酷？照片拍于智利的奇洛埃岛上一家旅舍： ##2 - We made all our office furnitures by ourselves! Well, mostly by my male co-workers, I only bought the green plants and put them there ;). Thumbs up to these awesome handy engineers turned carpenters!  I love that minimal bench, do you? Later we put cushions on it of course…:) in our office in Santiago de Chile  智利首都各国的男同事们自己打造的办公室木制家具，这群工程师摇身一变都成了木匠，木工活还做得这么好！ 我很喜欢那简单大方的凳子，你觉得呢？ 注：我木工手艺实在不行，但绿植都是我买的，求赞…… ##3 - Again in Santiago de Chile: I just feel the whole Latin America is a paradise of street art! 还是在智利首都圣地亚哥。我真心觉得整个拉美都是街头艺术的沃土（还有葡萄牙等南欧国家），随处可见色彩浓烈、想象瑰丽的涂鸦。 ## ##4 - Now we come to Chile’s neighbor, Argentina . These figures are from the well-known comic - Mafalda. The little girl Mafalda is so popular that it’s almost a national symbol like the beloved Evita! You can find her image in most book shops and souvenir shops in the capital city. in Buenos Aires (Oh how I loved this city! More detailed posts in future…) 阿根廷首都布宜诺斯艾利斯的街头，这些人偶是阿国出产的漫画《娃娃看天下》里的角色，风靡拉美和欧洲。主人公小女孩玛法达几乎成了和国母艾薇塔比肩的知名人物，在首都大大小小的书店、音像店、纪念品店里都能看到她的形象。 阿根廷是个文艺感爆棚的国家，布宜诺斯艾利斯也是我的心头大爱❤️，以后会陆续详细介绍。 （这又是欠下血债的节奏么……） ##5 - Another bench in Buenos Aires.  So why did I take a picture of it? Good question. Because it looked like a sofa bench when I passed by, what a relief for a tired traveler right? But when I sat on it, it turned out to be a cold piece of stone! 另一张阿根廷首都街头的凳子。这有什么特别的吗？我从它身边走过时，窃以为是张沙发凳，暴走一天的我不禁大喜，等坐上去才发现竟然是块冰冷的大石头！这设计是不是很有想象力？逼真到坑爹…… ##That’s it for today, please tell me what you think 樂 , so I know if there’s any audience interested in the left benches… See you soon! :D 又到半夜，好困 快来留言告诉我你的想法呗，以便我决定有没必要继续码字贴图，要不花这时间没人看多凄惨呐…… (￣▽￣)” Thank you for reading.

In this post I invite you to follow my photo journey to a Buddhist temple and meditation center in Mongolia. I took a couple of trains that summer from Moscow all the way to Ulaanbaatar. By taking separate legs of train 分段坐火车, I could get out and see the local places in Russia, instead of having to stay in one trans-Siberia train for a week(and no shower for 7 days in that case…aaah…). The Aryapala/Aryabal Buddhist Center is nestled on a hill among scenic valleys in Gorkhi-Terelj National Park 位于蒙古首都特勒吉国家公园的佛寺和禅修中心, about 2 hours’ drive from Ulaanbaatar. I explored this huge gorgeous park and spent one night in a typical Mongolian ger camp 蒙古包宿营 in the valley. In the head image here, you see a line of Buddhist prayer wheels 转经筒. These hollow metal cylinders come in different sizes: it can be a hand-held wheel carried by pilgrims (often seen in Tibet and Nepal) 朝圣者, or bigger ones set up in a monastery like these ones in my photo. In Tibetan Buddhism, spinning a prayer wheel is as effective as reciting the sacred texts 诵经, as a wheel usually contains a scroll printed with a mantra 祈祷真言/梵咒. On the outside of the cylinder there are auspicious 吉祥的 Buddhist symbols and inscriptions in Sanskrit 梵文 or Tibetan script. The Aryapala temple was built in the shape of an elephant’s head, and the 108(a sacred number in several Eastern religions) stairs leading up to the temple symbolizes the elephant’s trunk 象鼻. To reach the stairs, I first walked along a long path for meditation and reflection 反思. There were 72 signs with 144 Buddhist teachings 教诲 lining the sides of the path. The wise words on the signs remind people to reflect on the spiritual life. After this journey of enlightenment 觉悟, I arrived at the 108 stairs and walked up to the hilltop. The white-walled temple has intricate carvings on its wooden posts and beams 柱子和横梁. The rocks above the temple and the main hall are decorated with paintings and stories of the Arhats 罗汉. Arhat is a high-rank Buddhist saint who enlightens 开导/启迪/教化 humankind. There is also a small meditation cave aside. Aryapala Temple belongs to the Gelugpa sect(Yellow Hats) of Buddhism 格鲁派藏传佛教. Gelugpa practices focus on the journey to enlightenment as taught by Buddha. They teach devotees 信徒 to meditate and spark the bodhisattva 菩萨 within. In 1810s, Buddhist monks and artists from Mongolia and Tibet built this temple in order to meditate. Later in 2007, the restoration 修复 was completed and the meditation center was open to the public. The monks from Lamiran temple in Ulaanbaatar also come here regularly for religious service. Buddhism has been playing a vital role in Mongolia’s history and culture. Most Mongolian cities have developed on the sites of Buddhist monasteries. According to its national census 人口普查, over half of the population identifies as Buddhists. In the 13th and 14th century, the emperors of the Yuan dynasty started the process of conversion to Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia. In the ecclesiastical hierarchy 寺院/教会等级, the living Buddha 活佛 of Mongolia was ranked third after the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama 达赖和班禅喇嘛. Mongolian Buddhism was influenced by Tibetan Buddhist monasticism 隐修制度/禁欲主义/寺院生活, but it has its own distinct features, some of which are based on Mongolia’s shamanistic heritage 萨满教义, such as the ovoo(ceremonial cairn) worship rituals 一种祭拜自然的锥形石堆（类似西藏的玛尼石堆）executed by lama’s. Besides, in Mongolian Buddhism, there are many independent lama’s who can provide consultancy and don’t belong to any monastery. If you ever come to this amazing Terelj park in Mongolia, besides visiting this interesting meditation temple, you can also hike to the glacial lake 冰川湖, Khagiin Khar Lake and the natural hot springs, ride horses on the steppe, watch the wildlife such as Eastern Buzzard(I saw plenty hovering over my head) 亚洲秃鹰, brown bears(I didn’t get to see any)… If you like rock climbing, try out the many rock formations, like Turtle Rock and the Praying Lama Rock. I also learned cooking lamb from the host family, and watched locals wrestling 摔跤. I had so much fun packed with both natural and cultural experiences, and I’m sure you will too! So that’s it for the photo journey to the meditation temple. Tell me what you think in the comments!

It’s great fun for me walking around in this open-air market for a treasure trove of handmade souvenirs, after devouring some divine Louisiana Creole food and jazz music. As usual, I only bought small knickknacks like Creole recipe magnets, as I didn’t want to add burden to my around-the-US trip. 大家好！Aaronli主持的城市故事照片活动这一期的主题是“夜生活”，说到“夜生活”，可能多数人会想到泡吧、舞厅、美食夜市（也是我的最爱）之类，但今天我想跟大家分享一个美国南方新奥尔良/纽奥良市的艺术夜市。这个市场离宽广的密西西比河不远，处于法国区的边缘，是块夜生活丰富的地区。其实这里的夜市上也有各种让人垂涎的克里奥尔美食，只是我光顾着吃了，没怎么拍照片 ;p。 从这几张照片里可以看到，这个露天夜市缀有灯饰，展示出售当地艺术家的画作、手工艺品等作品。附近还有众多的殖民时期建筑、爵士乐吧、餐馆、画廊、书店等。我吃饱喝足，听了场爵士乐演奏后，又在这个大市场里逛了一圈，买了些颇具特色的小纪念品，比如做成冰箱贴的菜谱…… 最初河边这块地区是北美印第安人交易的商栈，在经过西班牙和法国的轮番统治之后，托马斯·杰斐逊购下路易斯安那州，新奥尔良这个地理位置得天独厚的首府也成为开放的港口，世界各地的船只在此停靠。 1791年，这里的市场建立起来。来自欧洲、亚洲、非洲等地的商人络绎不绝，在这里交易蔬菜、水果、花卉、咖啡、手工艺品等，这块市场也带动整个新奥尔良的日益繁荣兴盛。各种族的融合和商品的流通给此地带来了口味丰富的混合饮食、多姿多彩的独特文化和兼容并蓄的美妙艺术。 200多年来，位于泥泞多涝的密西西比河边的大市场历经飓风、暴雨、战乱、政治斗争，几经劫难，最终还是得以幸存并不断发展，成为当地人引以为荣的地标。我去的时候正赶上洪水刚过，整个城市损失巨大，很多建筑都在整修翻新。 然而这些打击并没有对乐观奔放的当地人造成多大负面影响，人们还是照旧进行了著名的传统Mardi Gras音乐狂欢节。Mardi Gras意为“肥美星期二”，是两周狂欢的最后一天，接下来的“圣灰星期三”就是西方基督教传统中“大斋节”的开始。由于从圣灰星期三一直到复活节前的40天里，传统意义上的教徒需要斋戒和忏悔，所以这之前人们会进行疯狂无节制的吃喝庆祝。我到那里时狂欢节结束没多久，地上还到处都是彩色的串珠。 In the 2 photos below, you see creative crafts upcyled from glass bottles and tin cans： 下图是创意又环保♻️的两个好例子： 废旧玻璃瓶摇身一变成了艺术品 各种饮料易拉罐做成的小鱼装饰 New Orleans boasts a dynamic art scene which has drawn creatives from around the globe. I loved its melting pot style of American, European, African, and Caribbean flavors. Locals like to call their city NOLA(New Orleans, Louisiana) or Big Easy(in 1970s a columnist compared life in the Big Apple New York City to life in New Orleans - The Big Easy). NOLA is known as the birthplace of Jazz and the fun Mardi Gras. Each year, people all over the world come to join this 2-week wild festive celebration throughout the whole city. I also enjoyed its Creole food a lot. Due to the wide variety of immigrant influences, Louisiana Creole cuisine has a rich and tasty flavor. Shrimp gumbo, Jambalaya, Oysters Rockefeller, Louisiana-style crawfish boil… mouthwatering… 下面这三张照片反映了新奥尔良几个闻名天下的标志：克里奥尔特色烹饪（美国难得的稍重口味，融合了法国、西班牙、意大利、爱尔兰、西非、加勒比等地区的风味）、迪克西兰爵士乐、生蚝螃蟹️等海鲜、各种辣椒酱…… Here are some symbols of NOLA: https://steemitimages.com/DQmYLrdvMMYd6EyNmRR1hKnBDoYHdPm2pPViStv5bWbo2CE/signredhot.jpg ##So that’s it for today’s story about NOLA night art market.

This’ll doo… 题图是我在澳大利亚新南威尔士州一处森林附近的路上用手机拍的。我觉得这一景象很有澳洲荒野的感觉，这个邮筒确实“可以将就……” =） ##The theme of @claudiaz’s photo fun contest this week is ‘No. 13’, and the place I live now is no. 11 on the street, so I just went out to the neighbor to take a picture of their mailbox, now I’m serving it freshly out of my camera! =) And the mailbox reminds me of some other creative mailboxes I encountered in my travels, and 4 trash cans too. Okay, I know they are different, but you throw something to all these containers, and most of them are made of iron, so… ;) The first 5 images are from my road trips in Australia, and the last 5 are from Patagonia in southern Chile. They are all original photos with little retouching, as I just want to show you these objects in real life… 我刚看到@claudiaz的“数字13”为主题的摄影活动，突然意识到我现在住的地方是这条街的11号，所以我就拿上相机去隔壁的门口拍了下面这张含有数字“13”的邮箱照片。 在西方“13”是个不吉利的数字，要是“13号”正赶上“星期五”被认为更不吉利，一般称作“黑色星期五”。但是现在北美更流行的貌似是感恩节后人们疯狂抢购的“黑色星期五”，由于商品打折，人们的抢购使商场利润大增，以黑笔记录盈利，因此被商家称作“黑色星期五”。 不吉利的“13”和“黑色星期五”据传是因为犹太教的安息日是从星期五日落持续到星期六日落。根据迷信的说法，每到安息日这天晚上，12个巫婆会举行狂欢，第13个在晚会高潮出现的魔鬼就是撒旦。一些人还认为圣经里的亚当和夏娃就是在这一天偷尝了禁果，而他们的儿子该隐也是在“黑色星期五”杀害了自己的弟弟亚伯。 I have no idea why this mailbox is so full of spider webs, but I think it fits pretty well with the rustic environment around… What do you think of the number ‘13’ and ‘Black Friday’? I don’t have any superstition about this, and in China, the unlucky number is ‘4’, since its pronunciation sounds like “die” in Mandarin. But still, I don’t believe in that at all. I still remember that when I was in university, the mobile phone service provider offered great discount for phone numbers with ‘4’ in it, so I just subscribed to a number with plenty of ‘4’s, and saved some money for food… I didn’t see anything bad in that, hehe… Also in China, you can rarely see a car plate number with ‘4’ in it, while some plate numbers with ‘8’ are sold in a high price, as ‘8’ sounds like ‘fortune’. Interesting right? In some buildings in the West, the 13th floor is missing. Likewise in China, you can’t find the 4th floor in some buildings. 当然，在中国又是另外一回事。有些人会忌讳数字“4”，因为众所周知的发音问题。反正我觉得无所谓。还记得当年上大学的时候，中国移动供应商还给含有数字“4”的手机号打折，所以我就去买了有好多“4”的手机号，哈哈，感觉省下了好多粮食钱。西方的一些住宅和写字楼里没有13层楼，就像中国的一些楼房不用4来标示楼层一样。这些迷信还挺有意思，虽然我是完全不信的。你是怎么想的呢？ The photo below was taken on Raymond Island, Australia, the habitat for koalas I once wrote about: 下图的邮筒拍于维多利亚州的雷蒙德岛，就是我曾经写过的野生考拉居住的地方： ##This very creative plastic mailbox was from a friend who built his own bungalow in a forest in New South Wales, Australia. He placed his mailbox at the entrance of a long rough road leading to his Utopia: 下图这个塑料邮箱虽然看着有点寒碜，但对一个朋友却意义非凡。因为他自己在森林里修建了一座大木屋，每天要开着越野车才能通过这条路况很烂的土路进出。而这个宝贵的邮箱就被他安放在长长的路口的一棵树上。听起来有点凄惨？但是天下哪里有真正的乌托邦，有得必有失，选你所爱、爱你所选而已。他就乐在其中，享受着自己的世外桃源呢。 I found this last mailbox from Australia at the Tambourine Mountain in the hinterland of Gold Coast. Seems this cow shape is pretty popular, soon you will see a similar one in another photo from Chile: 这最后一个来自澳洲的邮筒是在黄金海岸西边的内陆山区看到的。貌似这种奶牛外形的邮筒挺受欢迎，下面还有张来自智利的也是类似的设计： I shot the following ones in Puerto Natales and Punta Arenas in the Patagonia region of Chile: 下面这五张都是在智利南部巴塔哥尼亚地区拍的，虽然那4张竖的都是垃圾桶，但是都是铁皮容器，用来往里扔东西的，我就暂且放一起啦： https://steemitimages.com/DQmPYdy2UTyKQbPHYerXg7MAHXX8GvDgb2UScsqq143s4mR/IMG_62971.jpg https://steemitimages.com/DQmXk7PXyEqBXEXXhrcP5VqWniBveCvThuGVGdQjVSqrg2t/IMG_63001.jpg Thank you for reading.

The celebrations vary in different places. I didn’t join any fun activities this time, but only had some chocolates in a bunny shape and watched all those decorations and food in either a bunny or an egg shape in shops and supermarkets… =) The fertile bunny is a symbol of new life. Likewise, the Easter egg represents Jesus Christ’s resurrection. It’s said that to symbolize Jesus Christ’s shed blood on the cross, some people dye the eggs red. While in some regions in China, boiled eggs are dyed red as gifts for newlyweds or newborns, which also comes from the fertility and life connotation of the egg. During the Easter, some kids play games related to the Easter eggs, like egg rolling and egg hunt. Painting eggs is also a fun thing to do. Here are some egg candies I painted with my friends’ little nephews. It was during a previous Easter holiday when I visited my friends in Atlanta, USA. We used 3 food coloring markers to draw some random patterns on the egg candies. I guess you can tell which ones were done by the kids. Comparing to the kids’ wild abstract style, my drawing is not that imaginative, but I was definitely influenced by their cuteness… :) I also heard about the idea of naturally dyed eggs and would like to try someday. That is to make use of natural plants such as turmeric, purple cabbage, onion skins… So what did you do on your Easter holidays? Feel free to share your comments below! =) My post is inspired by @killerwhale and @aaronli’s photo contests themed Easter. Check out their pages and join the fun! :D 这个刚过去的周五到周一的长周末是西方的复活节假期。澳大利亚这里也到处都是复活节兔子和彩蛋的装饰。我这里拍的几张照片是前几年环游美国时，应邀拜访亚特兰大一对夫妇朋友时和他们的两个小侄子一起画的彩蛋。当时正赶上复活节，他们双方的父母和兄妹也去那里团圆，我在那里呆了一周，跟他们一起参加了些本地人的庆祝活动，体验了一下美国南方浓厚的基督教氛围。我们用的彩笔颜料和蛋都是可食用的，这种糖蛋的表面不光滑，画起图案来没有我想象的那么容易。估计你们一看就知道哪些图案是那两个小孩画的吧？ 相较这种狂野抽象的天真童趣，我画的图案只能是中规中矩了，呵呵。 复活节是为纪念耶稣被钉死在十字架后第三天的复活，是基督教里比较重要的日子。复活节期间，各地都有些不尽相同的传统习俗和活动，比如游行庆祝、泼洒圣水、去教堂做弥撒、滚火轮、穿戴一新、彻底打扫住处喻示新生活开始等。 还有一些和彩蛋有关的游戏，因为蛋是孕育新生命的代表，同时椭圆的形状寓意着生命的周期，这跟中国文化里的“圆满”也有相通之处。蛋自古以来就被用来庆祝新春，在基督教中，复活节蛋是耶稣复活的象征。复活节的时候，西方的很多家庭会让孩子们寻找巧克力彩蛋，或者把彩蛋放在有点坡度的地上滚，能抗住折磨坚持到最后才破裂的为胜利的彩蛋，胜利彩蛋的拥有者可以得到其他参与游戏者的彩蛋。 还有人会按照传统把鸡蛋煮熟后涂上红色，据说是代表耶稣洒在十字架上的鲜血。是不是有点像中国一些地区的婚庆和生日习俗？相传早在2500多年前，古波斯人就开始给鸡蛋涂色来迎接新年。最早关于基督教装饰蛋的习俗可以追溯到1290年，当时英国的爱德华一世订购了450只鸡蛋，染上颜色或裹上金叶分发给皇亲国戚们，雨露均沾一番。 好了，今天关于复活节和彩蛋的话题就聊到这里。欢迎留言分享你的想法，下次见！ Thank you for reading.

Yes, it is - STREET FOOD! I believe all foodies understand this enthusiastic joy. Food is a big reason I travel, and speaking of food in a nation, street food is always where the heart and soul is. Well, I might be biased as an Asian spoiled by all the fantastic street food widely available in Asia, but why don’t you give it a try? :) I see some people’s point when they frown upon street food for the fear of food poisoning. But there are still so many hygienic choices out there. Isn’t it exciting and fun to look at the whole process when the food is prepared right in front of your eyes like magic - quick, cheap and tasty! So come try some real food with me. This time it’s about the Vietnamese Street Food - Mini-Pancakes (Bánh Căn / Bánh Khọt)!  I took the 2 pictures above in Saigon(Ho Chi Minh City), and the following 3 are from a side street in Da Lat. You can see they are a bit different in the batter and toppings. This savory treat is said to be a specialty from southern Vietnam. It is made by heating batter in a griddle which looks like a cupcake or takoyaki pan, with different choices of toppings such as the ones I tried: shrimp, squid, eggs, minced pork and beef. After the bite sized half-sphere pancake is scooped out, it’s usually served with diced up chives/green onions, fresh herbs and vegetables, and spicy or sweet sauce for dipping. The batter used can vary at different street stands, like in the first picture here, it has egg in the batter, while in the second stand, it is mostly made of rice flour. Some batter is also mixed with leftover rice, turmeric and coconut milk. Whatever mix, it just turned out to be delicious! :D ##So what do you think of this little light meal from Vietnam? Tell me the street food you enjoy in the comments! =) 刚才看到这周六手机摄影的主题，真是无比兴奋激动，因为是“街头小吃”。作为一枚典型的亚洲吃货，却不住在亚洲，无福享用各色街头美食，我只能望梅止渴，来写写路上遇到吃过的街头小吃了。其实很想写中国丰富的街头小吃，苦于手头没什么照片，那我们今天就一起来看看越南街头的迷你煎饼吧！ 煎饼我们并不陌生，大中国从北到南，各色煎饼馅料口味众多，美味、快捷又便宜。而越南的这款迷你版煎饼做法和口感确实都有些特别。据说这种煎饼源于越南南方，我确实也没有在北方的街头看到。上面两张照片拍于越南南方的胡志明市（西贡）的一处街头，后三张拍于南部四季如春的避暑山城大叻的一条小巷弄。 迷你煎饼的做法从照片不难看出，用的烤盘类似国内用来烤鹌鹑蛋、日本做章鱼小丸子或西方烘培小蛋糕的那种。用料的配方各地各家会略有不同。前两张西贡的那家加入了比较多的鸡蛋液，而后面那位大姐貌似是用的糯米粉作为主料，吃起来更有嚼劲儿，而且烤制的时候还有小盖子盖着。有些面糊里还混有米饭、椰汁、啤酒和姜黄粉等原料。 煎饼的馅料也有各种选择，比如我尝试了虾、鱿鱼、猪肉末、鸡蛋、牛肉末等，最后再撒上香葱碎，美妙的滋味自不待言。前一家还洒上了蒜香味的小块炸面包，上了配菜，后一家则是给了碗甜丝丝的漂满葱末的蘸水，嘱咐（其实是手语:p）我先浸泡煎饼再吃，而无可救药重口味的我还是觉得不蘸甜水蘸辣酱更好吃，呵呵。常常是点了几个觉得没吃够又加点几个，真的是好吃到停不下来。 好了，今天关于越南小煎饼的介绍就到这里，你觉得怎么样？欢迎留言告诉我你爱吃的街头小食哦！ Thank you for reading.

In this post I’d like to show you a place full of colors and culture value. That is - Caminito in Buenos Aires! Caminito means “little alley” in Spanish, and it is located in the ghetto barrio La Boca. This traditional alley is a colorful street museum with great cultural significance. 今天我要带大家看看阿根廷首都布宜诺斯艾利斯的一条多彩街道 – 卡米尼托（El Caminito），意思是“小通道”。这条街位于贫民区博卡区，以街道两边五颜六色的波纹铁皮和木板房而著称。 It’s this place that inspired Juan de Dios Filiberto to compose the music for the famous tango “Caminito” in 1926. Thus it’s claimed as the birthplace of Argentinean tango. Today, plenty restaurants and bars here offer tango and folk dance shows to visitors. Besides that, you can also watch visitors who dressed up to try out this famous dance on the street(see the picture below). Not at the same level of course, but you get the feel! ;) Later in the evening we went to the traditional cafe - Cafe Tortoni to watch a tango show, which included several different performances. All of them were truly impressive - I should do a video post about this Argentinean gem someday(it will probably come to my mind again when there’s a contest themed DANCE…). Juan’s relative, the local artist Benito Quinquela Martín also used the buildings as his canvas to create paintings. Nowadays, more vivid and vibrant artworks by local artists have incorporated as part of the Caminito. 这个街头博物馆和传统胡同因为其多重文化内涵，在布宜诺斯艾利斯的历史上和当今时代都具有重要意义。因为这块地区激发了诗人胡安·迪奥斯·菲利·贝托的灵感，从而于1926年创作出著名的探戈舞曲 – “卡米尼托”。所以这里也被认为是阿根廷探戈的发源地。 历史上由于这里靠近港口，渐渐聚集了多家为船员服务的餐馆、酒吧、旅馆、色情服务场所。如今街道两旁的色情服务场所变为鳞次栉比的画廊、纪念品小店等。而且几乎每家餐吧门前都有探戈表演，我也在路过时简略地看了个大概。 当天晚上我们又专门去市内的Cafe Tortoni观看了整场精彩的表演，这家历史悠久的传统餐厅名气很大，带有舞台剧场，具体细节我以后会写到（估计如果将来我看到个跟“舞蹈”有关的竞赛活动，我这健忘的脑子会再度想起这一茬儿）。总之非常受震撼，阿根廷的探戈果然名不虚传！ At the end of the 19th century, around 3 million Italian (another 3 millions from other countries) immigrants arrived in Argentina, among them a significant number came from Genoa. Most of the Genoese immigrants stayed in this port area (La Boca) in Buenos Aires. So the exciting new life began! But with all these immigrants pouring in, there weren’t enough homes for everyone. To solve this problem, their traditional housing - Conventillos came to the rescue. These communal buildings had only one street entrance opening onto a patio interior that accessed a few tiny rooms. And the immigrants had to build many of their dwellings on raised foundations or piles due to frequent flooding. Imagine how crowded and hard it was to live in that environment! To build their Conventillos, these poor new residents went to the docks/shipyards to collect thin corrugated sheet metal and wooden planks. And the materials were painted with the leftover paint used for the ships. As a result, the houses became a colorful patchwork when they didn’t have enough paint of the same color to cover an entire house. That’s the first version of these colorful houses in Caminito. Later in 1950s, some locals, including the above-mentioned Argentinean painter, Benito Quinquela Martín, restored this neighborhood, with Benito’s initiative of painting the houses in more bold colors. In 1959, the government built a street museum with the name given by the well-known song “Caminito”. 19世纪末期，约有3百万意大利移民涌入阿根廷（还有另外3百万来自欧洲其他国家），其中大部分来自热那亚。这些热那亚人聚居在布宜诺斯艾利斯的港口区（博卡区）。充满希望的新生活就要开始了！兴奋！激动！然而人多地少，这么多人怎么住得下？于是他们便着手建造了来自家乡的传统民宅Conventillos，这种集体房屋含有多个小房间，可供大批人聚居，只有一个大门通向窄小的街道。而且为了防洪还要搭起高台。 刚到一块新大陆，怀揣满满的憧憬，但是一穷二白的现实生活显然没有那么容易。这些房子一般由廉价的木条和铁皮边角料建造，是从造船厂里捡拾而来。而粉刷墙面的也是造船厂里刷各色船只用剩的涂料，因为东拼西凑而来的涂料不够刷完整面墙壁，于是色彩各异的房屋外观雏形就诞生了。 到了上世纪50年代，在博卡区出生的著名艺术家贝尼托 · 金克拉 · 马丁（他也是探戈诗人胡安的亲戚）带领一些当地人在原先建筑的基础上进行改进，提倡用更大胆的色彩来装饰外墙。他还以这一区域作为灵感来源，创作出许多绘画作品。他不仅在废弃街道的墙上做画，还搭建了一块跳探戈的临时舞台。1959年，当地政府把这块街区建成了街道博物馆，以胡安那首著名的探戈舞曲 – “卡米尼托”为街道命名。 这里也随之涌现出大批模仿贝尼托风格的画家，建立艺术工作室，展示出售自己的作品。各种画廊、街头即兴创作给这里增添了更浓厚的艺术氛围，也给我们这些游客购买纪念品提供了各种多姿多彩的创意选择。 Caminito reminds me of many other places in Latin America which boast colorful architectures and decorations. You may think it’s too dramatic or effusive if you see this flow of colors on some other continents, but here, it just works. You feel the wild imagination and vibrant vitality, and it’s contagious, well, at least to me. I was strolling in this bright-colored neighborhood with a cheerful mood. =) Though this cultural site is more of a tourist attraction now, let’s not forget that this neighborhood used to be built from scratch by the poor immigrants, and it housed a whole community’s hopes and dreams. 写到这里，我联想到拉丁美洲很多地方的建筑、装饰色彩都是如此浓烈鲜艳，如果放在别的大陆，比如以性冷淡风格著称的北欧和日本，你可能会觉得有点恶俗，但是在这里，这一切仿佛都找到了自己的归宿，和谐地向路人展示着肆意奔放的生命力和想象力。而且，身处其中的你会自然而然地被这份狂野的美所感染。好吧，至少我是被感染了，走在这些多彩的街巷，心情也是格外缤纷。 虽然这块街区现在是个文化遗址和旅游景点，但不要忘记它曾经是大批穷困的新移民亲手建造的家园，是一个群体共同的希望和梦想之地。 ~ ## ##So that’s it for today’s Caminito.

I’ve long enjoyed Caribbean music, and I got to know a bit more about it when living in Puerto Rico. This photo on the left was taken at a port of Havana when I visited Cuba. The elderly man was singing a folk song in Spanish while playing his guitar. The beautiful Caribbean melody and his contagious smile reminds me of Harry Belafonte’s “Jamaica Farewell”. I first heard this song on the car radio in a road trip, and it’s been on my playlist ever since. Sold as calypso, this old Jamaican mento song is a classic hit in the 1950s and is widely covered. Besides the delightful rhythms and Harry Belafonte’s fabulous voice, I like the vivid description in its lyrics, and how it deals with the farewell. It brings me back to the many trips of my own - there’s always something from the destination that impressed you, although you are reluctant to say goodbye, the great memories will stay with you for the rest of your life journey.

That is a period when plenty of classical animated movies were created in China. I would love to paint more of them in the coming future. I just love these old traditional movies created from Chinese ink and wash paintings. To me, they were so beautifully done in a time without much fancy technology, and they are timeless with native Chinese aesthetics. It’s the director’s attempt to break away from Western style animation, influenced by the style of the Chinese painting master, Qi Baishi. I am by no means a master in Chinese painting, but I’m attempting to recreate the characters from the film: the little tadpoles and their frog mama. “Where’s Mama?” is a story about a group of little tadpoles in search of their mother. After some adventures and misadventures of encountering water creatures like shrimp, gold fish, crab, turtle, catfish… they finally find their mother frog. ~ 关于《小蝌蚪找妈妈》~ 感谢@angelina6688举办”齐白石杯”绘画比赛，让我重拾多年没碰的毛笔。这期主题是“动漫角色”，虽然我也看过些盛行的日本动漫，年少无知时还和同学成立了动漫俱乐部，玩过cosplay，但看到题目时，我最先想到的却是中国60年代众多的国产动画。 其中1960年的《小蝌蚪找妈妈》是中国乃至世界第一部水墨动画片，斩获多项国际大奖，堪称动画中的精品。什么？我这是暴露年龄了吗？好吧，你也可以说因为小蝌蚪们只是一堆墨点，所以是最简单易画的角色。 但是，上海美术电影制片厂的大师们却利用这些墨点的游动，在短短15分钟内，出神入化地将中国山水画的韵味和栩栩如生的角色描摹相结合，带给我们充满意趣的光影艺术享受。在那个电影技术不发达的年代，这种突破西方动画制作手法，表现中国古典美学的尝试真是难能可贵啊！(这句式叫我想起小学作文结尾常用的感叹……) 当年的动画制作人觉得齐白石的画印在脸盆上看上去很逼真，就想尝试着把它做成动画。于是便有了水墨动画《小蝌蚪找妈妈》，它的原型出自白石老人的名作《蛙声十里出山泉》。当然，我的艺术修养和绘画技艺不及白石老人的万分之一，但还是借此机会拿起画笔，享受下挥洒的乐趣吧。另外，因为从小对满大街的笔墨纸砚、字画装裱比较熟悉，所以我在贴出绘画步骤时，也用中英文对文房四宝等国画的基础知识做个简要介绍，正好响应大伟哥@rivalhw牵头的@cn-reader传播中华文化的号召。 What I Use:  ##### Oriental Brushes, Raw Rice Paper, Chinese Ink, Chinese Pigments, Palette/Saucers, Brush Washer(Water Container)The rest 3 are optional: Paperweights, Mat, Brush HolderSo in the following content I’m going to include also the introduction of “Four Treasures of the Chinese Study”, namely brushes, ink, paper and ink stone. These are the basic necessities required in a scholar’s study in ancient China, to create a calligraphy or painting work.####~ About Brushes ~ ##Here I have 2 round brushes with a sharp tip (I’d like to use more but I only found these 2 varieties in a shop): The one on the left is supposed to be made from stiff hair such as wolf or ox… The hair retains a bounce when wet and regains its sharp tip when you decrease the pressure on it, so you can vary the width of a brushstroke when writing or painting with ink. The one on the right is supposed to be made from soft hair such as goat or rabbit… The hair becomes floppy and flexible when wet, so it’s generally used to paint great surfaces and for gradations of colours. There is another kind of brush with mixed hairs. Its external crown is made of flexible goat/rabbit hairs, with an interior end of hard wolf/ox hairs. So it combines the quality of the two above-mentioned brushes. ## 材料：毛笔、生宣、墨、国画颜料、调色盘/碟、笔洗+清水、镇纸、毛毡、笔山（后三项可选）~ 关于毛笔 ~ ##左边深色毛的是小狼毫，正品的话顾名思义是由狼毫制成，毛质较硬，控制笔画粗细相对容易。右边浅色毛的是小白云，正品的话一般是兔毛、羊毛之类的软毛制成，蘸水变软，所以多用来大面积晕染颜色。还有种介于以上两者中间的叫兼豪，外面一圈软毛，内侧是硬毛，绘画效果自然也是介于狼毫和羊毫笔之间。 ## Step 1: Use the stiff-hair brush to outline the shape of a lotus.第一步：用稍硬的狼毫笔大致勾出荷花的轮廓。（其实我那两只烂笔用起来并没多大区别）## ~ Freehand Style VS Gongbi Style ~ Here I apply the freehand style, also known as ink and wash painting in China. Another type of Chinese painting is called Gongbi, literally “meticulous”, different from the freehand style that focuses on the general conception and rhythm, Gongbi usually depicts figurative or narrative subjects in highly detailed brushstrokes. In ancient China, Gongbi is often practiced by artists who works for the royal court or in independent workshops. While the ink and wash painting was one of the “Four Arts” of the Chinese scholars and officials. ~ 写意 VS 工笔 ~ 这里我用的是类似《小蝌蚪找妈妈》水墨动画中的写意画法，不求形同，只求神似。还有一种国画种类就是众所周知的工笔，在古代一般是宫廷画师或独立画匠赖以生存的饭碗。而水墨画则主要是古代的学者官员们“琴棋书画”这些雅兴中的一种，通俗点说就是吃饱了撑着没事干时用来画着玩玩的~ 还请原谅我看破红尘的粗鲁。 ## Step 2: Use the soft-hair brush to paint the lotus leaf, water and the base of plants.第二步：用稍软的笔染出荷叶、池水和水草。## ~ About the Paper ~ You can see that the raw rice paper is absorptive, which is good for ink or pigments to make ranges and to show textures. This kind of Shengxuan paper is widely used for Chinese calligraphy and ink paintings. Actually I feel the paper I used is like a semi-raw one, as it’s not that absorptive and gets dry quickly. Another type is called Shuxuan or Fanxuan paper, literally means alum paper. It is the raw absorbing paper coating with an alum solution. So it is not absorbing the ink or pigments, which is used for the precise layout of Chinese paintings, like the Gongbi type I talked about earlier. A particular Chinese silk called Juan is also used by painters. This glossy fabric boasts a lustre for expressing textures in some Gongbi paintings, but silk deteriorates much faster than the 2 kinds of rice paper. Rice paper is known as “long-lasting paper of a thousand years”, with a history of over 1500 years. Most of the paintings and calligraphy works from ancient China done on rice paper are still in a great condition. It is because the paper is made of straw from the rice plant(thus rice paper) and unique Qingtan tree(Wingceltis) barks (pictured below), which contribute to the resilient texture. I once visited a paper-making factory, and I was amazed by the process of creating this wonderful medium for Chinese painting and calligraphy. photos by @itchyfeetdonica in the Rice Paper Cutural Museum and Workshop in Anhui Province, China ## ~ 关于宣纸和熟绢 ~ 我用的是(半)生宣纸，墨汁和颜料较容易晕染开来，所以这种纸一般用在写意画和大幅书法上。而熟宣或熟绢则是生宣纸或生绢经过一定比例的胶矾水刷制成的。因为其不渗墨色的性能而多被用来画工笔。熟宣纸有薄有厚，胶矾水含量有浓有淡，以蝉翼笺最薄，冰雪宣最厚，还有书画笺、云母笺、清水书画宣等。通常薄笺适合画淡彩，厚宣适合画重彩。熟绢比熟宣纸有光泽，工笔画面效果较好，但不容易经久保存，所谓“千年陈丝不如草”，“纸寿千年绢寿八百”。 我曾去宣纸厂参观过造纸过程，宣纸主要以青檀树皮和沙田稻草为原料(见上图)，檀皮决定纸的韧性和拉力，稻草决定纸的洁白度与柔软度。当地独特的水质和青檀皮使制造出来的宣纸韧性强、耐老化、少虫蛀，寿命长，被称为“千年寿纸”，造纸工艺迄今已有1500多年历史。薄、轻、软、韧、细、白的纸张有助于书画创作时达到“墨韵万变”的效果。 根据檀皮与稻草的不同配比，宣纸又可细分为棉料、净皮、特种净皮三大类，还可按大小规格、纸面纹理分类，但今天就不扯那么多了，留待下次吧。 ## Step 3,4,5,6…: Draw the frog, the tadpoles and the grass with the hard-hair brush. Color the lotus flower and the frog. Use the soft-hair brush to dot the soil and to add more layers to the water and plants.第三、四、五、六……步：画完剩下的青蛙妈妈和蝌蚪宝宝，给荷花、大片水草染色，点出更多前景的淤泥和细草。## ~ About the Pigments &amp; Ink Stone ~ As I was so involved in painting, I forgot to take pictures for each step. I only realized it when I almost finished the whole thing, haha… Sorry for that. When I was painting, I found the pigments contain more particles than the genuine Chinese paint. It’s more like the Western gouache paint, so I decided to draw the frog in a more “gouache” way. That’s why you don’t see the Chinese-painting style frog here which resembles a dark fluffy mud fish to me. Chinese pigments contain more glue than Western gouache paint and watercolours, making the pigment bind better to rice paper and silk. Outside of some basic traditional pigments made from natural plants and minerals without glue, other colours are made from synthetic chemicals. For example, the 5 tubes I used are synthetic versions that already contain glue. Traditionally, to get the ink for painting, Chinese painters use a solid ink stick to rub on a stone with water. When they control the time of rubbing, various densities of ink could be obtained. The ink stone can come with many forms and sizes, which is considered as art itself. Today, most of us just buy ink in small bottles or cans, like what you see in my photo. ~ 关于颜料 &amp; 墨砚 ~ 这里因为我画得太尽兴，一时忘了拍照，等到几乎画完才想起来没有一步步拍，罪过，都怪我这人生太随性~。尽情挥洒泼墨的时候，我一度发现这劣质颜料颗粒很大，更像是画水粉的，再说山水画里的青蛙通常是个毛绒绒的黑团，我觉得跟泥鳅更神似，所以我画青蛙妈妈时索性放弃了写意画法，反正主角是蝌蚪宝宝们。哈哈哈，我是不是太不拘小节，画随心动了？ 国画颜料主要是矿物和植物提取物制作的，除了十几种自然基础色外，其他颜色多为化学合成物。和水彩、水粉画颜料一样都可用水稀释，但国画颜料的水性胶含量大过水彩颜料， 而颗粒较水粉画颜料更细。国画颜料相比油画更柔和，不像油画颜料那么容易覆盖，适合小面积的涂染。 油画颜料则是矿物和化学合成物制作的，用的是松节油等植物提取油，不含水性胶。 关于墨汁，传统的做法自然是用墨条在砚台上磨，还记得古装戏里温柔磨墨的妃子或书童吗？还好我没生在古代…… 这事儿还真考验耐心~ 不禁暗暗感激发明瓶装墨汁的人。根据磨墨的时间和力道不同，墨自会产生深浅浓淡的差别，再加上水的调和作用，墨分五色，变幻无穷。砚台本身也是造型多样、材质各异，很多都是具有收藏价值的艺术珍品。古代文人墨客对砚十分重视，不仅常相随，死后还用来殉葬。米芾就对一方山形砚台爱不释手，苏东坡也爱称砚台为“石君”、“石友”。 ~ About the 4 Basic Techniques ~ So I’ve talked about the “Four Treasures of the Chinese Study” - brushes, ink, paper and ink stone, plus the two styles of Chinese painting and differences between Chinese pigments and the western ones. Now I’d like to move on to the 4 basic brush techniques of Chinese painting: gou (outlining/contouring), cun + ca (wrinkling/texturing + rubbing), dian (dotting) and ran (coloring/dyeing). Gou is to draw lines of the basic shapes; Cun + ca is for the textures and shades of rocks, mountains, trees and plants…; Dian is to dot the moss, grass and spots on rocks; Ran is to dye the landscape to make layers. There are still so many more tips and techniques but I won’t ramble on today in this post - it’s already long enough. I’m more than happy if you have read along till here. ~ 关于基本技法 ~ 刚才讲到笔墨纸砚这文房四宝和颜料（敲黑板……），现在继续简要聊聊中国画用笔的技法，虽然我这次画的并不是纯正的国画，只是对动画角色的再创造而已。根据古典法则，四个基本技法是“勾、皴、点、染”。“勾法”指用各异的线条表现不同形态和质感；“皴法”用来表现山石树木的质地、脉络、凹凸、阴阳、向背；“点法”是说点出山石上的苔藓、斑点等；“染法”指用淡墨或色彩将景物染出立体感。至于具体的步骤，限于篇幅就不再介绍，而且我这种疏于练习、随意放飞自我的业余水平就不瞎班门弄斧、贻害众生了。况且国画的气韵也不是一点技法就可以表现出来的，需要长期的观察、体验、修养和练习。感兴趣的童鞋可以跟Steemit上的@helene, @dancingapple等国画好手潜心学习~  ##So that’s it for today’s content about Chinese painting.

So today I’m sharing my solution with you: to make a plant saver! It’s not only solving the problem of watering plants, but also an environment-friendly way to upcycle used plastic bottles and to make use of old fabrics. So why not give it a try? Now let’s dive into the steps: @aaronli举办的活动这期主题是“绿”，而且@dancingapple也发起环保征文，因为我平时挺喜欢绿色植物和DIY，所以这次就正好一石二鸟地写篇用环保的方法来展示绿意吧。 可能有些朋友也遇到过这种情况：要出门旅行或出差几天，家里的绿色植物没人浇水照看怎么办呢？不知道你是怎么解决这个问题的？现在我就来分享一下一个环保的小方法：用废弃塑料瓶和纺织物做成自动给水花瓶。这样既能废物利用，又可以解决无人浇水问题。下面就跟我一起来看看这是怎么做成的~ ~HOW TO MAKE IT~~具体步骤 ~ ##Step 1. Cut a big plastic bottle as in my pictures below:  1. 先用小刀把洗净的大号塑料瓶（装可乐、雪碧、纯净水之类的那种大瓶，或者更大容量的桶状矿泉水瓶）割开，注意比例（如下图所示）– 上半截较短，以便倒插之后下面还有放水的空间： ##Step 2. Make a short cut at each side of the lower-half bottle:  2. 给下半截瓶子的两侧各剪开一道小开口，以便于稍后倒插“花盆”： ##Step 3. Cram a long piece of absorbing fabric into the opening of the first-half bottle (can be your worn socks, old cotton clothes that you don’t wear anymore…):  3. 在瓶口塞上吸水性好的布条，比如破袜子、破抹布、不会再穿的旧衣服之类的（又是废物利用的一个好例子哦）…… 瓶内瓶外各留一半布条，以便传递水分： ##Step 4. Fill water in the lower-half bottle, and plant the flowers/plants into the first-half bottle with soil. Place the first-half bottle into the lower-half one. There you go - the self-watering plant saver is done! Pretty simple, isn’t it?  4. 在下半截瓶子里装上水，把土壤和绿植栽到上半截瓶子中。这样，一个利用废弃物制作的自动给水花瓶就完成啦！是不是很简单快捷？关键是出门在外几天就不用担心家里的植物喝不到水枯死啦。 So that’s it for the plant saver DIY. What do you think of this idea? How did you get your plants watered when away from home? Feel free to share your comments below! 好了，今天关于DIY自动给水花瓶的分享就到这里啦，希望你们喜欢！也来动动手，让绿色装点一下你温馨的小家吧，还能为环保出一份力哦~ 你养了绿色植物吗？是怎么解决出门在外时的浇水问题的？快来留言告诉我你的想法吧。下次见！=) This page is synchronized from the post: ‘#91 DIY with Donica: Make a Plant Saver DIY环保小物~自动给水花瓶 | 月旦评’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@itchyfeetdonica/91-diy-with-donica-make-a-plant-saver-diy-or/"},{"title":"#92 Geometric Shapes - Architectures + Furniture + Sculpture 几何摄影5张 | 月旦评","text":"Hey there my Steemit friends!

Nowadays, it has been attracting visitors and expats from all over the world, with its mild temperature throughout the year, its low expenses in living and its booming vitality across the city. The citizens are proud of their home rated as one of the world’s most innovative cities, along with New York and Tel Aviv. When I was in Medellín, I found so many digital nomads of different nationalities based there, some of them fell in love with the place and decided to stay longer. ##25年前，哥伦比亚的第二大城市麦德林被《时代》杂志称为“地球上最危险的城市”，如果你看过2015年热播的Netflix原创剧集《毒枭》，可能会对这个世界上最大的可卡因加工国和贩运国有些许了解。该剧颇为真实地讲述了上世纪八十年代哥伦比亚大毒枭帕勃罗·埃斯科巴传奇的一生，而他的老巢就在麦德林。 如今，这座焕然一新的春城和纽约、特拉维夫一起被评为世界上最具创新性的城市。在这里旅行时，时刻可以感受到当地居民的自豪，近年来翻天覆地的变化给他们带来了新生活的希望。麦德林也以四季如春的气候、低廉的物价和宽松的政策吸引着越来越多世界各地的人们前来工作定居。 .jpg) There were lots of intriguing sights and exciting activities going on in Medellín that I plan to blog about. And today, I’m sharing my experience in visiting Comuna 13 of this impressive eternal-spring city. Comuna 13 is a densely populated and poor neighborhood among Medellín’s 16 barrios. It used to be the most violent area in this formerly “murder capital of the world”. Ok, imagine, a notorious slum area with the highest murder rate in “the most dangerous city on earth”! Sounds scary right? The good news is this neighborhood managed to reinvent itself from the drug and gang wars. Sure, things are not just black or white, and a new comuna is not built in one day, but the positive changes towards a good direction is still something amazing to see. ##麦德林有着太多我想分享的故事，今天就先请大家跟随我的脚步，一起来探索它曾经臭名昭著的贫民窟13区，看看这个被称作“全世界最危险的谋杀之都”里的“最暴力的贫民窟”有着怎样的过往，又是怎么转化为如今这个朝气蓬勃的新社区的。当然，任何事情都没有非黑即白这么简单，但是这样积极的转变总是激动人心的，不是吗？ .jpg) .jpg) There are a few organized tours guided by local agencies that you can join. However, I decided to visit Comuna 13 independently to find out what’s it all about. Another traveler I met earlier in the same hostel in Panama was also interested in the place, so we took a bus together to the neighborhood. After about one hour in the bus and some walk up the steep slopes, we finally arrived at the gate of Comuna 13: ##当地的旅行社也有组织由导游带领参观这个贫民窟的活动，但是一直很惧怕跟团的我决定还是自己去一探究竟。只身深入虎穴，有点怕怕啊~ 还好前些天在巴拿马的旅馆里认识的一位英国小哥也飞到了麦德林并打算去贫民窟看看。所以我们一拍即合，共同前往。于是搭了巴士，晃晃悠悠一个小时终于到了山脚下，又走了一截上坡路，最后来到13区的入口： .jpg) https://steemitimages.com/DQmamevcMyDzgMa6AWX824K5aS1azA56wefQV2n5j5YX3qE/C1.jpg .jpg) The Troubled Past##Some decades ago, Comuna 13 was controlled by gangs and drug lords, the most infamous being Pablo Escobar from the 1980s. (I can probably write a book about him based on all the 2-sided stories told to me by locals.) The narrow staircases along the steep hills made it difficult for police to enter to take action, as each gang had its own lookout on the high mountaintops so they could easily escape. Different gangs fought over control after Pablo Escobar’s death in 1993, causing high murder rates. In 2002, when the Colombian military were fighting over left-wing guerrillas, over 100, 000 residents of Comuna 13 were left in the heavy combat and siege. Many of these innocent inhabitants were killed or injured. As a result of the victory, the paramilitary groups began to control the whole city of Medellín allied with the police. ## 血雨腥风的过往##几十年前，偏居一隅地处山谷的13区被毒枭帮派所控制，最有名的要属八十年代以帕勃罗·埃斯科巴为首的团伙。这里插播一下：关于这个在哥伦比亚甚至整个美洲家喻户晓的人物，我简直可以根据史实记载还有当地人跟我的各种口述写一本长篇小说。他的狡诈、贪婪、凶恶、勇猛、精明、果敢、革新精神甚至侠骨柔情、劫富济贫，褒贬不一，皆为传奇。这块贫民窟山区地势险要，道路逼仄，各大团伙都在高高的山岗上建立了哨所，因此每当警察叔叔们试图干预，他们很容易就逃之大吉。 1993年，帕勃罗·埃斯科巴被击毙后，各大贩毒团伙竞相争夺控制权，导致谋杀等犯罪率居高不下。2002年，哥伦比亚军队跟左翼游击队交火时，13区的10万余民当地居民被困在围攻搏斗中，大量无辜群众被打死或受伤。作为战斗胜利的一方，准军事部队开始和警察结盟，共同统治整个麦德林城。 .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) The Revival##Later, Comuna 13 welcomed some new changes. An architect suggested the world’s first giant outdoor escalators to connect neighborhoods – the 6 covered escalators with bright orange roofs were completed in 2011, which was a great help for the locals. Before that innovation they had to climb up the steep hills for half an hour, while now it’s a comfortable 5-minute ride. Local government offered young people free paint and tools for their creativity. That’s why we could see so many stunning murals on the buildings and walls by street artists. These colorful creative works surely played a role in cheering people up. I also noticed a few libraries and community centers. The inhabitants were encouraged to read the wide choices of books and magazines from handy manuals to world literature works. There were also various activities for them to participate. The abundant flowers and plants in the new parks provided a refreshing and relaxing atmosphere. More and more organized tours to this unique barrio have been launched as well. After a few months, I visited some favelas(slums) in Rio de Janeiro of Brazil, and witnessed the similar success story of transformation. There are for sure lingering issues, and much work remains. I heard that gangs were still controlling some slums and there were occasionally shootouts. But at the same time, there are clear signs of progress, and most importantly, after all the violent wars and conflicts, there is HOPE (touching background music should be played here…). ## 孕育希望的当前##接下来的日子里，13区迎来一系列积极的改变。一名建筑师提议建造了世上第一款沿山坡运行的室外升降电梯（见下图）。这六个封闭的玻璃大电梯有着鲜艳的橙色顶盖，于2011年完工投入使用，给当地居民提供了极大的便利。想想看，之前人们需要爬坡至少半小时才能到达半山腰或山顶的家中，而有了这些电梯，只需5分钟就可以轻松上下。 当地政府给年轻的艺术家们免费提供了各色油漆和作画工具，以供他们挥洒自己的热情和创造力，同时改善贫民窟乏味的外观。于是便有了我们现在看到的无处不在的涂鸦艺术。从下面我拍的照片中可以看出，很多作品水平高超、色彩鲜艳，丰富的想象力让人惊叹。漫步在随山势起伏的民房间，我还注意到几座小图书馆和社区活动中心。居民们可以在此博览群书，参加各种社区活动。还不时可以见到新建起来的小公园，种满花草，有涂鸦的墙壁、滑梯、滑板空间等设施。 当地机构也开始组织越来越多的活动，带领游客前来参观。几个月后，我在访问巴西里约热内卢时，看到那里依山而建的贫民窟也颇为成功地复制了这里的创新模式。当然，罗马不是一天建成的，还有很多问题存在。贩毒团伙仍然控制一部分贫民窟，而且时有枪击发生。不过，居民生活的改善有目共睹，而且更重要的是，在经历了那么多暴力的冲突动乱之后，对新生活的渴求不再那么遥不可及，人们的心里有了希望（此处该有如好莱坞大片高潮时气势磅礴的背景音乐响起……）。 .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) My lovely travel buddy from England was quite nervous walking around there, he kept saying he was paying close attention to everything surrounding us, since we could be shot at any time. But I found the locals pretty friendly and busy living their life just like anywhere else in the world: the elderly people were sitting outside and chatting, most younger folks were working, and children were playing and chasing each other happily. I didn’t see any reason they would hurt us. So I was wandering about with a light heart. Maybe I was too positive but luckily nothing bad happened. I think it helped when we were 2 people and didn’t wander too far from the main stairs and escalators. If you go there, make sure you watch your belongings in case of any street robberies, which I’m afraid could happen not only in this neighborhood but in many other places across the globe. ##我们在山间游荡时，我的旅伴 – 那位来自英格兰的小哥一直非常紧张。他不停地跟我说他在密切关注周围的一切，以防我们被乱枪击中。而我觉得周围的居民跟别处的也没有什么两样，看上去挺友好，都在忙着过自己的生活：老人们在门口坐着聊天；年轻人大都在干活；孩子们在嬉戏玩耍。总之我是看不出什么重大危险来。 所以我心情很轻松地四处逛着。也许我太乐观了点，不过还好一直没什么险情发生。可能因为我们是两人同行，也没有走得离电梯太远。如果你们也去到这种贫民窟，其实就跟世界很多地方一样，都是要注意防备，看好自己的随身物品啦。 .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) I guess I have this problem of lacking fear in my travels, like once I was strolling alone in a hillside slum in Guayaquil of Ecuador, and I didn’t feel anything dangerous. Later there was a local woman who told me it’s not safe to walk there, so she accompanied me downhill to the main streets. I was very grateful for what she did for me, otherwise there might be some safety issue, if a local thought so – they must know the place much more than a solo traveler like me. So two lessons learnt: always be careful and always listen to the locals.  ##可能我在单身的旅途中有点太大无畏了，比如有一次，我在厄瓜多尔的贼城瓜亚基尔的一个山头贫民窟闲逛，也没觉得有什么异常。但逛了一会儿，突然有位当地的中年妇女过来跟我说这里太危险，一边说一边用手比划着砍头的姿势，说完就把我一路送下山。想想还是很感激她的，万一有什么危险可就惨了。她毕竟是当地人，肯定比我了解情况，既然她都说不安全，那我就真的不该在那儿侥幸逗留了吧。 故事寓意：出门在外尽量小心，多听从当地人建议。 .jpg) .jpg) When we were having dinner in a roadside snack bar, a young woman suddenly walked to us and started winking to my travel buddy. It might be obvious that we were not a couple, or she just didn’t care, as she kept smiling to him and handed him a note with her phone number on it, haha. My fellow traveler was getting blushed by this sudden sweetness. We tried to talk to this girl and some other inhabitants about their life there, as their stories could always offer first-hand insight into the local culture. It’s a pity that our crappy Spanish couldn’t go too deep in the conversation, but the locals seemed to be pretty laid-back and happy about their new life. We walked around those brick and cement houses with corrugated iron roofs, greeted local residents and were greeted by them. There were cute kids running to us and posing in front for photos. I could constantly feel the vibrant, creative and cheerful vibe in this community. We stayed at the mountaintop till dark, so we could have this fantastic night view of the lit houses tucked away all over the rolling mountains: ##随后我们在路边的一个小餐吧里吃晚饭，突然间，一位衣着破旧、长相普通但却风情万种的姑娘摇曳生姿地向我们走来。估计是我们俩看着就不像一对情侣，或者她也根本不在乎是不是，总之她完全忽略了我的存在，一个劲儿冲着那位英国小哥微笑抛媚眼，还问店家要了一张小纸条，写下自己的号码塞到他手里。这些热情似火的拉丁姑娘也真是可爱，我在加勒比和南美居住之后发现她们的撩汉技能真是望尘莫及啊，哈哈。那位内敛的英国绅士还立马羞红了脸，但是这姑娘已经一屁股坐到了我们旁边。我们就试图跟她还有其他当地人聊聊家常，以了解下当地生活和文化。只可惜我们破烂的西班牙语不足以进行深度交流，但似乎周围的人都过得挺开心快活。这多数拉丁人乐观的天性又是我一无趣的东亚人常常觉得难以企及的一点 =)。 我们在这些红砖水泥房间游走，跟当地人打招呼，也被当地人问候。还不时有可爱的小孩子跑过来摆造型要求拍照。我的旅伴也似乎放松下来，说可以感受到周边友好活跃的气氛。我们一直在山顶呆到天黑，看到了下面这张照片里的美景： .jpg) ##So that’s it for today’s sharing about Comuna 13 in Medellín, Colombia.

It’s sunny today, and I’m in a beach mood, so vamos a la playa(let’s go to the beach)! :) Come follow me to Cayo Jutías - a mangrove-covered key situated in western Cuba’s Pinar del Río province. I was staying in a casa particular (a local’s house) in the picturesque town of Viñales, which is best known for its dramatic limestone hills, caves, and tobacco fields. I should seriously do a (dozen) post(s) about this amazing valley too! In the morning I walked to the town center and found a bus leaving for Cayo Jutías. What I read about this place in Lonely Planet came to mind, so I hopped on the bus on a whim. Yeah, without even swimming suits, sunscreen or snorkeling gears. So hello Caribbean sun and sands! I’m coming, with only my sunglasses and camera… =) ##今天阳光灿烂，不禁想起加勒比的无敌海滩。现在就请大家跟我来古巴一处鲜为人知的海滩吹吹海风散散心，看看濒危的红树林。这处Jutías珊瑚沙滩位于古巴西部海岸，Jutías是当地一种树鼠。 我当时住在Viñales这个以石灰岩山、岩洞和烟草种植（听过帅气的古巴雪茄吧？）闻名的迷人小镇。那天早上，从当地民宿信步走到镇中心，突然看到一辆中巴就要发车前往Jutías沙滩。想到我在旅游指南《孤独星球》上看到过这个不知名的小地方，想必是野趣横生，就不假思索地跳上了车。到了车上才想起来，惨了，连个防晒霜都没带，更别提泳衣、潜水镜之类的了。好吧，只能硬着头皮拥抱加勒比毒辣辣的阳光，又是难逃一天被晒焦的命运…… .jpg) After about one hour, I reached the long blanket of white shiny sand. This wild, remote and tranquil beach is attached to the mainland by a short causeway. A “cayo” means a “key” in English - a sandy, low-lying island formed on coral soil, which is a common landscape throughout the Caribbean islands. Jutías is named for the indigenous tree rats in this region. ##大约一小时后，中巴到达一片密林边。下车走了一截，穿过茂盛的从林后，突然间，白得晃眼的一长条沙带伴着无边的碧海蓝天，就这么在眼前伸展开来。 .jpg) .jpg) Here I only found a small hut selling drinks, a family playing on a boat and a couple of other people sunbathing or swimming. You can rent a sun chair or sea canoe for a low price, and spend a relaxing afternoon at this gorgeous utopia. There was no overnight accommodation here, which might be a good thing for keeping it serene and unspoiled. I heard the sands here turn pink at sunset, but I couldn’t test or photograph it as I had to go back to town with the last bus. Some people call this place the most discovered “undiscovered” beach in Cuba. There’s another pretty beach to the east in this province called Cayo Levisa, which boasts some choices of overnight stay, but it’s also less tranquil. ##这片荒凉的野地只有一个卖饮料的草棚，周围除了一家人在海里戏水，远处有两三个人在晒太阳、游泳，别无他人。你可以在这儿很便宜地租张沙滩椅或独木舟，尽享这世外桃源的宁静。 此地也没有旅馆酒店之类的住宿，所以除非你睡在车里或露营(可能并不允许)，当晚是不方便赖在这儿的。据说这里的沙子在夕阳的光线下会变成粉色，可惜我要赶着下午最后一班车回镇上，也无从验证这一奇景了。 有人把这里称作古巴鲜为人知的海滩中最为人所知的一处，毕竟上了旅游指南书了嘛，也就很容易传开了。这个省区靠东边还有一处风景绝美的沙滩Levisa，有夜宿设施，所以也少了份幽静。 .jpg) .JPG) .jpg) .jpg) I walked around to explore each corner and dipped into the warm sea afterwards. I just didn’t see anyone around, so the picture of me above was taken by hanging the camera on a tree behind - that’s why it’s such a strange angle, but I’m happy that I was still in the frame. ;) The wind was blowing hard. Lush green bushes were growing wild along the sandy beach, and dead mangroves were scattered all over the place. These light logs and branches looked unique against the turquoise water and blue sky. Though it’s a pretty fascinating view, it’s sad to see these mangroves dying of thirst. ##我忙不迭地四处撒欢起来，然后去温暖的海水里泡了会，只可惜风浪太大，不太适合游泳。周围方圆几里几乎没有人的踪影，我只能拍拍沙滩上的死螃蟹、茅草棚里的小贝壳，还有各种疯长的野草和干枯的红树林。因为实在难寻路人帮忙拍照，我就把相机挂在一棵树上，定时拍下了上面这张照片。虽然角度诡异，但好歹我还在镜头里边，已经很满足了;)。 下面照片里枯死的红树林在这里随处可见，在蔚蓝天空和碧绿海水的衬托下有着一种独特的美感，可是，这却不是什么好的现象，而是大自然给人类敲响的警钟。 .JPG) .JPG) .jpg) .JPG) The Essential Roles of Mangroves##Mangroves make up 20% of the forests in Cuba and cover 4.8% of its territory. They play a vital role in the tropical areas of the Americas. In Cuba, four species of mangroves – white, red, black, and button have been utilized to produce charcoal, railroad ties and tannin for curing leather. Mangroves also serve a crucial role in the environment and biodiversity: they provide breeding grounds for marine life, prevent flooding and saltwater intrusion into fresh water and farmland, and they can curb erosion of shorelines. But sadly, the mangroves in Cuba have been deteriorating fast. The dead logs and branches you see in my photos here are a common sight in many coast areas in the country. So what caused this scene? 红树林的重要作用##红树林占到古巴森林总面积的20%，覆盖全岛4.8%的领土。在整个美洲的热带地区，红树林的作用都至关重要。在古巴，有四种红树林木被用来制造木炭、铁路轨枕、固化皮革用的丹宁酸等。 红树林在保护环境和生物多样性方面也扮演着重要角色：它们为鱼类等海洋生物提供繁殖的温床，可以防洪，阻滞盐水入侵农田和淡水资源，还能抑制海岸线受侵蚀。 但很可惜的是，古巴以及世界各地（包括中国）的红树林都在快速消亡。又是什么导致了这一现象呢？ .jpg) Why They Are Deteriorating Natural disasters like droughts and hurricanes are getting worse and worse due to climate change. To fight these disasters, the Cuban government had a policy in the 1960s to store up fresh water. As a result, most rivers in Cuba have been dammed and almost 1000 reservoirs have been built. Because the dams cut the natural circulation of the fresh water, the mangroves can’t get as much water as they used to. So as a vegetation which requires a constant flow of fresh and saltwater, mangroves in Cuba have been weakening. Thus another natural disaster is actually happening. Besides the lack of fresh water, deforestation, soil sealing, industrial pollution, shrimp farming, and the construction of dikes and channels, also contribute to threatening the 11 species of mangroves in this region. Not only in Cuba, over half the world’s mangrove forests have been destroyed over the last 30 - 40 years. And different regions of the world have different causes for mangroves’ deterioration. ## 红树林消亡的原因##由于全球气候变化，干旱、飓风等自然灾害越来越严重。为了抵御这些灾害，古巴政府于上世纪60年代出台一项全面存储淡水资源的政策。结果就是，古巴的绝大多数河流都筑起水坝，全国各地先后建起大大小小1000多座水库。 因为这些水坝切断了淡水的自然循环，导致红树林可以吸取的淡水急剧减少。而持续不断的淡水和盐水供应对红树林的生长必不可少，所以它们开始逐渐消亡。所以政府为了抵御自然灾害作出的行动，反而又造成了另一项自然灾害。 除了淡水的缺乏，过度砍伐、土壤板结、工业污染、虾类养殖、堤坝水渠的修筑等，也对这一地区的11种红树林造成了威胁。不仅是在古巴，过去三四十年间，全球超过一半的红树林都遭到毁坏，各地区的原因也有所不同。 .jpg) ## What Can Be Done##So what can be done to help preserve the mangrove forests? Now in Cuba, there are SOS Mangroves programs led by NGOs and their local partners as well as education authorities. Part of the mangroves in the area have been protected in the Wildlife Refuge Area. Students have been educated about the ecological system while cleaning up and monitoring the coast. While there are still large parts being destroyed or deteriorated. It’s important to educate locals and raise public awareness of the importance of protecting mangrove forests. Government and other organizations in some countries have done campaign and support efforts to these activities. There are also regulatory enforcement like heavy fines for cutting down mangroves. Planting more mangroves at suitable places should be encouraged. Locals living in the vicinity of mangrove forests can be trained to take up alternative jobs rather than extracting the resources of the mangroves. What else do you think could be done to protect these mangrove forests? Feel free to share your other thoughts too! Until next time. =) 怎么保育红树林##那么问题来了，应该做些什么来防止红树林进一步消亡呢？现在在古巴，已经有一些非政府组织和各地的合作机构共同成立了SOS红树林救援项目。部分红树林也在当地野生生物保护区里得到了保育。教育部门指导学生们监测海岸生态、清理垃圾，同时对他们进行生态系统知识的宣传和教导。然而由于相关法律法规不完善，仍有部分红树林被损毁或正在消亡。 传授当地居民相关红树林生态的知识和其他挣钱养家技能，提高公众的环保意识非常必要，督促他们减少对红树林的依赖，转而另谋生路。有些国家已经广泛开展活动，进行这方面的宣传教育。会对胡乱砍伐红树林进行高额罚款，同时鼓励大家在合适的地方多种植新树。 中国的红树林保护区主要分布在浙江、福建、两广、海南这些气候温暖的沿海区域。这里推荐一个很棒的保育红树林的网站 – 中国红树林保育联盟，根据网站给出的数据： 自从1975年香港米埔红树林湿地被指定为自然保护区，1980年建立东寨港省级红树林自然保护区以来，中国对红树林的保护工作逐渐重视。至今，我国建立了以红树林为主要保护对象的自然保护区20个，其中国家级6个（海南1个、广西2个、广东2个、福建1个），省级5个（海南、广东、广西各1个、福建2个），县市级9个（海南5个、广东4个）。保护区总面积约6.50万公顷，其中红树林面积约1.67万公顷，占中国现有红树林75.9％，为我国红树林湿地的有效保护提供了重要基础。 目前，我国所有的真红树植物和半红树植物均在保护区得到了较好的保护。保护区为大量的珍稀鸟类提供越冬和栖息地，是我国红树林资源保护的主体。此外，保护区还是开展科学研究、进行宣传教育的良好场所。香港米埔红树林保护区受WWF的资助，已发展成为一个国际性的红树林保护和教育基地。 ##你觉得还可以做什么来帮助保护濒危的红树林呢？记得留言分享哦！下次见。 .jpg) All content by @itchyfeetdonica 文字照片均为本人原创差点忘了提，大才女@dancingapple的环保征文和大才子@aaronli的“城事影像”都是超棒的活动，我这篇文章也受到这两个活动的启发。记得去他们的页面继续流连一下~也来参加活动哦 :D 感谢阅读！你的关注/点赞/留言/转发就是对我最好的支持~ 下次见！:)Thank you for reading.

I’ve been teaching Mandarin to non-native speakers for over 10 years, and now I’m working with @cn-reader to introduce Chinese language and culture. Today is Mother’s Day, so let’s learn a Chinese idiom about mother’s love. In this post, we will have a look at 孟母三迁(mènɡ mǔ sān qiān), which literally means “Mencius’ Mother Relocated Three Times”. 孟/mèng : family name of 孟子/mèngzǐ (Mencius)母/mǔ : mother三/sān : three迁/qiān : move, relocate ##So why does she do that and what is this idiom used for? Let’s first check out the original story: Mencius was a well-known ideologist and politician in ancient China, who was seen as the second saint in the School of Confucianism after Confucius. This story is about Mencius’ mother who relocated their homes 3 times, to offer a better environment for little Mencius. When Mencius was a kid, their first home was close to a cemetery, so little Mencius copied the behavior of the tomb visitors and cried a lot. Mencius’ mom didn’t want that, and they moved to downtown, close to a market. Then little Mencius started to copy the vendors in yelling to sell produce and products (personally I don’t think it is that bad - can be good for his entrepreneurial spirit, but yeah it’s in ancient China…). So his mom relocated again - their new neighbor was a butcher from whom the son tried to learn how to kill pigs (oh nooo…). After some careful consideration, Mencius’ mom picked their new home by a school. This time it seemed to be a great choice, as her son studied frequently in the school and learnt good manners as well. From then on, they stayed living in that place, and Mencius eventually grew to be a great person. So this story shows mother’s love to her child. In order to find a good place for the child’s growing, parents tend to sacrifice a lot ever since ancient China. Today, Chinese use this idiom to describe the same situation - a mother or parents do whatever they can for a better living of their child, especially when it comes to education. ## Example Sentence：“孟母三迁，择邻而居” 说明了中国重视教育环境的传统。 “孟/mèng 母/mǔ 三/sān 迁/qiān ，择/zé 邻/lín 而/ér 居/jū ” 说明/shuōmíng 了/le 中国/zhōngguó 重视/zhòngshì 教育/jiàoyù 环境/huánjìng 的/de 传统/chuántǒng。 Meaning: Mencius’ mother relocated three times to choose their neighbor. This shows the tradition of how Chinese people value their children’s education. Photo taken by me at a Miao minority village in south-western China ##大家好！因为今天是母亲节，而我教过多年对外汉语，所以我们来学个跟母爱有关的成语：孟母三迁。 孟子是中国古代战国时期一位有名的思想家和政治家。这个故事讲的是孟子小时候，母亲为了给他提供良好的教育环境而搬家三次。 起初孟子的家靠近墓地，所以他就模仿去上坟的人的祭奠亡灵的动作，还常常哭丧。母亲看到后觉得不能让孩子在这样的地方住下去，于是他们就搬去城里。新家就在集市旁边，小孟子又开始模仿商人叫卖东西，孟母觉得这里也不适合居住，于是继续搬家。这次的家靠近一户屠夫，结果小孟子学习屠杀的样子还是让孟母十分担心。最后，孟母思索再三，把家迁到书塾附近，这回小孟子开始常去书塾学习，饱读诗书，而且跟着读书人们学得很有礼貌。孟母看到后很欣慰，觉得这才是适合孩子居住的地方。孟子在母亲的悉心教导下，逐渐成长为一位大圣人。 这个故事充分体现了伟大的母爱。父母总是为了子女的成长全心付出，不求回报。现在，人们通常使用这个成语来形容父母为了孩子能够接受良好的教育或生活在舒适的环境中而煞费苦心。 例句：“孟母三迁，择邻而居” 说明了中国重视教育环境的传统。 “孟/mèng 母/mǔ 三/sān 迁/qiān ，择/zé 邻/lín 而/ér 居/jū ” 说明/shuōmíng 了/le 中国/zhōngguó 重视/zhòngshì 教育/jiàoyù 环境/huánjìng 的/de 传统/chuántǒng。 ##All content above by @itchyfeetdonica ##Here is the story from a Youtube channel:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNqw79n0y6A ##What do you think of this story?

Today I’m going to show you a DIY home studio in the old district in Havana, Cuba. Seemingly useless stuff like old newspapers and wires were upcycled into cool figures here. Before that, I would first introduce the concept and benefits of “upcycle”, and recall some upcycling examples from my previous posts. Upcycling is a trendy way that contributes to sustainability. It also boasts some benefits comparing to recycling. Conventional recycling methods couldn’t deal with certain materials, while upcycling reuse items made of most materials, and very little part is discarded in this process. Another major benefit is it’s more energy efficient than recycling. Recycling often breaks down the original material using more energy to make something else. Instead, upcycling usually utilizes a used object in an innovative way without reprocessing the material it’s made from. For example, we can repurpose books, logs, cupboards, feathers, glass bottles, coke cans, mixed media, etc., to find value in old objects. In my previous posts, I mentioned some examples, such as what you see in my photos below: ##最近这些年，低碳生活逐渐成为人们所倡导和践行的环保理念，很多人开始在日常生活中试着为环境保护贡献一点自己的力量。英语里传过来的一个词 “upcycle” 变得越来越流行，势头盖过原有的热词”recycle” (循环利用)。”upcycle” 意思是“升级改造”，指用创新的方式将一些废弃旧物进行改造，让其发挥新的功效。 和循环利用(recycling)将原材料完全拆解再制成别的东西相比，升级改造(upcycling) 不对原材料进行再处理，而是换个方式利用它们。除了节约能源，升级改造的另一个好处就是能够让那些传统循环方式无法回收处理的物品再次被利用。 我在之前的文章里也提到了不少这样的例子，比如下图中智利首都圣地亚哥一些利用旧材料做成的圣诞树、奇洛埃岛上一家旅馆用旧窗户当作茶几使用、美国新奥尔良艺术夜市上由易拉罐做成的鱼形装饰和废弃酒瓶压制而成的砧板/盛器等。 ##The 5 Christmas tree photos below were shot in Plaza de Armas(the central square) in Santiago de Chile, most of them were made of used objects like shoes and rag dolls: ##I love how they upcycled the old window to a table in this hostel on the island of Chiloe: ##The two pictures below were taken at a night art market in New Orleans, USA: ## Now please follow me to a DIY home studio in Havana, Cuba.

Of course there are also full of colors in other parts of the world, and not everything in Latin America is colorful, but when it comes to COLOURFUL, the first candidate popping up is always this part of the world. ##According to Wiki, Latin American countries are: a group of countries and dependencies in the Western Hemisphere where Spanish, French and Portuguese are spoken. So there are some exceptions here, such as:the former British colonies Belize and Guyana,the former Dutch colony Suriname,some parts in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras and Panama…many Caribbean islands like Bahamas, Dominica, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Antigua &amp; Barbuda… Oh how I love geography and culture, and if you love it too, I recommend to you the awesome Youtube channel Geography Now by Barby! Ok, now I have to stop rambling about the geography and move on (rambling) to the topic of COLOURFUL. ##I mentioned in my previous post about the Colorful Caminito in Buenos Aires, Argentina: Caminito reminds me of many other places in Latin America which boast colorful architectures and decorations. You may think it’s too dramatic or effusive if you see this flow of colors on some other continents, but here, it just works. You feel the wild imagination and vibrant vitality, and it’s contagious, well, at least to me. I was strolling in this bright-colored neighborhood with a cheerful mood. =) 阿根廷首都的卡米尼托区让我联想到拉丁美洲很多地方的建筑、装饰色彩都是如此浓烈鲜艳，如果放在别的大陆，比如以性冷淡风格著称的北欧和日本，你可能会觉得有点恶俗，但是在这里，这一切仿佛都找到了自己的归宿，和谐地向路人展示着肆意奔放的生命力和想象力。而且，身处其中的你会自然而然地被这份狂野的美所感染。好吧，至少我是被感染了，走在这些多彩的街巷，心情也是格外缤纷。 In the coming days, I would love to blog about much more colorful architectures, nature, food, art, crafts, clothing, etc. in Latin America, such as the houses and streets in Havana, Guatapé, Salento and Salvador, the graffiti in San Juan, Bogotá, Santiago and São Paulo, the churches and palafitos on Chiloe island (many drone videos too), the colorful coastal cities Valparaiso and Punta Arenas, the colorful food in Mexico, the colorful landscape and traditional clothing high up in the Andes… Here are some COLOURFUL posts I did about Latin America earlier (still updating this list), check them out if you are interested: :) Follow Me to Grey GlacierTraditional Clothing in Peru’s Colca CanyonTrekking in Rainbow Mountains in PeruMount Fitz Roy in Argentina and Its StoryReach Torres del Paine in a Different Way!Exploring Comuna 13 of MedellínThe Wild Cuban Beach and Dying MangrovesAn Abandoned Boat on the Island of ViequesColombian Coffee Triangle’s Fun Vehicle - Willys Jeep…… And today for the Photo Collage Contest(finally, drum roll please…), I’m putting together some colorful elements of the pretty colonial town Olinda, on Brazil’s northeast coast. Since they were all taken with my phone, it’s not a bad idea for the collage, otherwise these poor pixels in one single picture might be stretched all over the screen on Steemit. ;) Olinda sits around a tree-covered hill overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. Except for its beautiful natural setting, this well-preserved artsy town is a historical and cultural center in Brazil. In 1535, Olinda was founded by the Portuguese, and served as an important center of the sugarcane industry since the end of the 16th century. For almost two centuries, sugarcane industry was the mainstay of the economy in Brazil. 巴西西北部大西洋沿岸的古城奥林达依山傍海，不仅所处的自然环境非常美，也是巴西的历史和文化名城。1535年，葡萄牙人建立了这座城，自16世纪末期起的两百年间，一直都是巴西经济的支柱 – 甘蔗糖业的重要中心。 So what did this thriving sugar economy bring to Olinda? I could clearly see the affluence and prosperity from the architectures and gardens in Olinda’s historic center. It is such a charming town with all those colorful houses, fabrics, fruits, flowers and art-crafts. When I strolled through its old streets, a lot of happy locals were playing music, singing and dancing outside their homes or shops. I also tried listening to some folk music in a CD shop and totally fell in love with the tunes. If you have any questions or thoughts about these colorful elements from Olinda, feel free to leave your comments below! Exchange makes change.

You will see three parts in this post - an exhibition of chasing light, the Pulse Light Show, and the evening lights at Victoria Harbor. First, let’s check out a photography exhibition in HK Cultural Centre. As we know, photography is an art of light. This exhibition – “Her Journey; Her Passion” showcased photo works of 16 HK female photographers who travel the world to chase the light. I wish one day my travel photography could reach such a level that I would do an exhibition like this as well! In fact, speaking of Hong Kong in light through camera lens, the first photographer comes to my mind is Fan Ho. He is a master of utilizing light and shadow to depict a quintessential Hong Kong. He has captured lots of classical moments in this city with his timeless black and white images. Together with a few other photographers who focus on shooting Hong Kong, I could write another 10 posts at least, so I’m not rambling too much here today. Wait for my coming posts! =) Now please follow me to tour the world through these awesome photographers’ eyes: ##今天请大家跟随我的脚步，一起来看看香港这颗东方明珠的独特光芒。本文会分为三部分，按照时间顺序，分别是：追逐光影的摄影展，“脉动”灯光秀，还有维港夜色。 首先，我们来瞧瞧一个名为“旅程~女情”的摄影展。摄影是一门用光的艺术。这里展出的作品是16位香港女摄影师游览全球各地，追逐光影所拍摄的自然风光和人文景象。她们技术高超、风格各异（见下图）。希望将来我也可以达到这样的水平，展出自己的世界旅游摄影。 其实呢，说到香港摄影，我首先想到的大师是何藩。何老先生用它的相机展现了一个黑白光影中永恒经典的香港。只是这次影展是香港新晋女摄影师在世界其他地方所拍作品，而关于何藩镜头下的香港，或者他作品的赏析和感想，我以前也写过手稿，再结合其他几位专门拍香港的摄影师，我完全可以另写至少10篇，所以今天这里就不展开太多了，可能不久的将来会写到。 现在就请先随着我的手机镜头，来看看这些女摄影师眼中的世界： Part 1 – An Exhibition of Chasing Light逐光的影展 .jpg) ~~~ Mildred Lai’s India:印度：.jpg) ~~~ Anita Tong’s Hokkaido:日本的北海道：.jpg) .jpg) .jpg) ~~~ Stella Lo’s Lake Baikal:俄罗斯的贝加尔湖：.jpg) ~~~ Susanna Choi’s Tibet:西藏：.jpg) ~~~ .jpg) ~~~ Anab Leung’s Australia:澳洲：.jpg) ~~~ Antelope Valley in USA:美国的羚羊谷：.jpg) ~~~ The Winter in Northern China:中国北方的冬天：.jpg) ~~~ Janice Wan’s New Zealand:新西兰：.jpg) Part 2 – Pulse Light Show“脉动”灯光秀 ##Then I came out of this gallery and walked on. On my way I happened to witness this Pulse Light Show. The colorful lights were projected to the big screen to show motion pictures. It’s incredibly crowded at the venue, so I only took these 3 photos below in the short time when I could hold my phone above all the heads, without a chance to take a longer video which would show better the changing frames: 走出文化中心的影展画廊后，我继续往码头方向走，恰好看到下面这场绚丽的“脉动”灯光秀。五颜六色的灯光被投影到前面的大屏幕上，播放不断切换的动画。这里简直是人山人海，对于一个习惯了高人口密度的亚洲人来说，虽然算不了什么，但在这人口攒动之间想拍个照还真不容易，别说灯光秀的视频了，我连下面这仅有的三张照片，也是费了九牛二虎之力，才把胳膊举到黑压压的一大片人头之上才勉强拍下的： .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) Part 3 – Evening Lights at Victoria Harbor维港夜色 ##After watching the light show, I walked to the pier of Tsim Sha Tsui to take the famous Star Ferry to Hong Kong Island. Operated since 19th century, Star Ferry has been an inexpensive mode of harbour crossing for local commuters between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island, as well as a popular attraction for tourists. I chose to come when the sun was setting, so I could see both the views of the splendid sunset light in the sky and of the gorgeous lights from the buildings. The first three pictures below were clicked when crossing Victoria Harbor. In my last three photos and the head picture are the views from Wan Chai Ferry Pier after landing. I believe the skyline here is one of the best known ones across the world. Just spectacular, isn’t it? It’s also a popular subject among photographers. Unlike many who carried a tripod and a big camera to shoot seriously the harbor views here, I only chose to bring a phone with me in this muggy hot weather. I guess that’s the main reason I couldn’t reach that high level of the above-mentioned photographers - it’s my LAZINESS, except for the limitation of my camera gear. ##观赏灯光秀后，我又继续往尖沙咀码头走去。因为趁这个日落的好时机去搭乘天星小轮，正好可以看到空中的日落之光和两岸建筑渐次被点亮的璀璨灯光。维港两岸夜空中鼎鼎大名的天际线总是众多摄影师酷爱的题材，只是在这种酷热的天气里，我实在懒得背个相机甚至三脚架出一身汗，只带了只轻便的小手机随手拍拍算了。呵呵，这可能也是为什么我还达不到上面那些女摄影师的高度，除了自己破旧器材的局限性，懒惰估计才是主因。 这些照片的前三张拍于天星小轮里，后三张和题图是到了对岸的湾仔码头后拍的。我觉得这片天台是拍摄维港风景挺不错的一处地方，人也很少。这些独具特色的天星小轮自19世纪末开始为乘客摆渡往返于九龙和港岛，也逐渐为外地游客所钟情，成为观赏维多利亚港和两岸风光的交通工具。 All content by @itchyfeetdonica, all photos shot by iphone 7图文皆原创 So that’s it for an evening of light in Hong Kong, hope you enjoyed it like I did!

The Origins I stumbled upon the Drawing Raccoon Challenge from the pages of @ericet and @kidsreturn. Also, the theme of @angelina6688’s Drawing Contest is Military Equipment this month. To kill two birds with one stone, I was thinking of drawing something with both themes in it. That’s how this work of “raccoon and potato cannon” was born. I’m not sure if a potato cannon is a “military” equipment, but yeah, it’s fun ! And have you noticed how happy the 2 potatoes are in my drawing? I suppose they enjoy it! :D Happy International Children’s Day(coming soon…)! Ok, let’s shooot~ ##大家好！这次我来展示一下自己刚画的一幅卡通的步骤。画的主角是小浣熊和土豆炮。什么？为什么是这两样风马牛不相及的东西？且听我细细道来…… 缘起 两位美女@angelina6688和@kidsreturn分别主办了齐白石杯“军事装备”绘画比赛和“新手村首届画浣熊”比赛，所以作为一个大忙人我不会告诉你其实就是懒，我就在想怎么节约时间高效率同时参加两个活动呢？答案就是：让小浣熊和军事装备同时出镜呗~ 小浣熊在我眼中是比较可爱的形象，不忍让他举着冲锋枪射击或者舞刀弄剑开坦克之类，而且六一儿童节就要到了，所以我一拍小脑瓜 – 就画个同样可爱的土豆佳能炮来给他玩玩好了！有没有被我的想象力所折服？哈哈哈 而我为什么要在23号晚上画呢？因为画浣熊比赛24号截止啊！我一直觉得应该给最后期限一点仪式感，如果不重视它的临近所带来的极度兴奋和焦虑，不在最后期限之前的一点有限时间里赶死般完成任务，那它的存在还有什么意义呢？毕竟每一天都有不同的deadline要赶，赶赶更健康嘛~ 生命不息，奋斗不止！上帝保佑我在今晚24号东八区23:59前写完本篇哈…… =) 好了，瞎扯到此为止，下面进入正题： ## What I Used材料a drawing pad, water colour paint, 2 brushes, 6 colored pens, a black marker, a 2B pencil绘画本、水彩颜料、小排笔2支、彩笔6支、黑色马克笔1支、2B铅笔1支.JPG)##What I Did步骤 ##I’m a bit hesitant to use step 1, 2, 3… as I didn’t really follow any rules or certain steps. I think normally we are supposed to first outline all the shapes, and later color them. But I couldn’t wait to try out the new water color paint I bought, so I finished coloring the raccoon before I drew other objects, haha, I know, I’m too random… And I drew the little boy potato with a purple marker - I was thinking drawing the girl potato in pink, and it’s matched with purple, but later, I found this purple was a bit out of nowhere, so I regretted using this color instead of blue!Anyway, here is the so-called Step 1 – Draw and color the raccoon and the boy potato:##其实我有点犹豫要不要弄个第一步、第二步、第三步…… 因为我真的没有遵循什么步数，毕竟不是什么专业的画家啦。冥冥中，我觉得似乎应该是先勾完所有的轮廓线（其实我很后悔用黑笔勾了线，不太自然的感觉），再上色，但由于等不及想试试看新买的水彩颜料的效果，所以我就先给小浣熊上色了，哈哈哈，我是不是太随性了…… 我还把浣熊握着的土豆男孩画成了紫色，是因为想着跟后面粉色的土豆女孩相配，结果发现这种紫色有点突兀，跟画面的其他颜色挺不协调，还不如用云朵和炮架的蓝色。不管怎样，我还是来假正经地标个步骤好了： 第一步 – 勾画出小浣熊和土豆男孩，并用水彩上色：.JPG) ~~~ ## Step 2 – Draw the cannon and the girl potato:To make the cannon design a bit special, I customized it with the auspicious cloud pattern from ancient China ;). Hmmm, it should be “designed by a Chinese” instead of “made in China”, my mistake… And it’s your mistake if you still think “made in China” equals bad-quality(oh how patriotic I am! ;p). And I made the 2 potatoes very happy and excited, since I would feel so if I was shot out of a cannon to a faraway place. Imagine the swooshing sound flying away freely, and please ignore the science behind it, like hot and burning, blah blah… this is just a cartoon.  ## 第二步 – 勾画出土豆炮和土豆女孩：注意到没有？炮身上绘有美丽动人的中国传统特色的祥云图案哦！男女两个小土豆都很开心地投入到射击游戏中，想想看，被从炮筒中飞快地射出去，自由地在空中翱翔，这是多么惬意的感受啊！请各位小伙伴忽略这其中的科学道理，毕竟这只是卡通画啦~ .JPG) ~~~ ## Step 3 – Draw the bird and the sun:Apparently the sky above is lacking something. So I just added a bird tied with a balloon, since I always feel it would be cool to save some energy when flying. I believe the birds would love this idea too. What do you think? Also, Mr. Sun needs his sunglasses, flipflop and a glass of drink to enjoy this beautiful hot day. Ain’t I considerate? Haha… ## 第三步 – 画出小鸟和太阳：显然，小浣熊和小土豆们头顶上空荡荡的天空里还缺了点什么。所以我就来加上只飞翔的小鸟吧，给她拴上氢气球，应该会省力不少，呵呵，慢悠悠的在空中浮游，一边看看地面的风景，该是很多鸟儿的梦想吧？小多同学你可能想多了……人家鸟儿可没那么多闲工夫 还有太阳先生，这么个大热天，也是需要戴个酷酷的墨镜来遮阳滴是遮他自己吗！云朵桌上还得供着清凉饮料和人字拖，才对得起这满满的夏日风情啊~ .JPG) .JPG) ~~~ ## Step 4 – Finish all the coloring, shade with the pencil, and add a title and signature:## 第四步 – 完成所有的水彩上色，用铅笔画上阴影，添上标题和日期签名：.JPG) ~~~ ##Here are the details of the raccoon and the cannon, since they are the 2 themes for the 2 contests:下面是小浣熊和土豆炮的细节图，因为它们毕竟分别是两个比赛的主题： .JPG) .JPG) ##好了，到这里卡通就画完了，希望你们喜欢！提前祝各位儿童节快乐，童心永驻！:) 一直以为自己以成熟理性著称，却不知道为什么常常是画点东西出来，被人说太萌幼稚，而且色彩太缤纷。哎，你们就将就着看吧。欢迎留言给出你的批评建议~ ##At last, to remember this 100th post of mine, I took a picture of my introduction sign I made last December, together with this cartoon drawing I did yesterday. I was holding this sign for the intro photo to include in my first post on Steemit, and the paper I used then was from the same drawing pad. :) Time flies - 5 months has passed, swooshing like the flying potato from the cannon, and happy time as well! I’m not going to ramble on how much I appreciate this platform and @ all the awesome friends I made here. I might do that in the coming future when I reach a milestone like 1000 followers? Who knows, I’m lazy anyway… But still, I would love to say thank you all, and you know who you are! =) ##最后要说的是，我发现这是自己来Steemit后写的第100篇文章，而去年12月做第一篇自我介绍时用同样的纸张画的袋鼠和写的姓名日期也一直夹在这绘本里，所以我就给它们来张合影留念吧~ 时光飞逝，正如土豆炮里射出的小土豆一样新成语：土豆过隙，“飕飕”地飞向远方。按理说，我应该在此表达自己对Steemit这个平台的感激，并@所有在这里认识的朋友，呼朋引伴，让大家都来看看。但是，我毕竟是个比较低调的懒人，也许会等到1000个粉丝(虽然可能很多僵尸)的里程碑时，再来玩玩分发SBD彩蛋的游戏吧~ 谢谢你们！不用我@, 你明白“你们”是谁~ =) .JPG) 感谢阅读！你的关注/点赞/留言/转发就是对我最好的支持~ 下次见！:)Thank you for reading.

This time it’s not my feet itchy to travel around, but my hands itchy to write travel posts! ;) So now let’s visit a typical Miao minority ethnic region in Southwest China. Considered to be the largest living museum of the Miao primitive culture, this group of small villages - Xijiang Qianhu Miao Village is located in the mountainous region in Guizhou Province. I reached this place from Kaili, a nearby city known as the cradle of certain ethnic minorities in China. 各位周末愉快！这刚过去的一周多一直在连夜赶工一份技术专利校对和翻译，眼珠子都快掉进厚厚一沓设计图纸里了，现在终于有空来写文，手痒痒得不行啊。=) 对，一般是脚痒痒想四处旅行，但这些年满世界走动，输入很多，觉得有不少内容亟待输出，很开心能在这里和大家分享。今天就请跟我去中国西南最典型的苗寨一探究竟吧！西江千户苗寨位于贵州省凯里市附近的雷公山，包括十余个依山而建的苗族小村落，是全国乃至全世界最大的苗族聚居区，来到这里仿佛置身于一座巨大的苗民生活博物馆。 Its name Xijiang Qianhu Miao Village literally means “a thousand household(Qianhu) by West River(Xijiang)”. Since it’s a well-known consolidation of typical Miao communities, the main village here can get pretty touristy. Yet it’s a great cultural destination with particular charm, especially when you go to explore the less-visited surrounding hills. The locals have been living for centuries in those wooden houses on the slopes of hills. Look at how people’s residences blend with the natural settings! I was amazed by such perfect harmony. From my photos, you can see the idyllic scenery, which is even more breathtaking when all the houses are lit in warm lights at night. By then it’s more obvious to tell the outline of the whole village that resembles a buffalo head. Miao people see buffalo head as an auspicious totem that wards off evil spirits. I’ve found this shape and symbol widely used in patterns and decorations in the village, such as the top of the traditional headpiece I tried out (pictured below). .JPG) .jpg) Generation after generation, the people here work in the surrounding rice paddies and make exquisite Miao silverworks, batiks and embroideries. They chase away bad spirits with silver jewelry, and cure their illness with all kinds of Miao herbal medicine from the dense mountain forests. They celebrate life events with plenty of local festivals, when people (mostly women) put on their finest silver jewelry and embroidered costumes. I tried out one copy with fake silver jewelries (pictured above), and it’s not that easy to walk around with the huge headpiece and all those bling bling decorations. You can imagine how heavy it is when it’s genuine silver all over your body, but well, like always, many are willing to pay a price for looking good. ;) Plus it’s a cool tradition to wear this on festive days, and the girls might be happy to dress up when there were not many choices in clothing or accessories in deep mountains in the early times… In events like wedding, celebration of new-borns and village gathering, Miao people have a traditional way of sharing food called Long Table Banquet. The hosts are supposed to sit at the left side of the table and the guests at the right side. Besides enjoying the delicious local delicacies like fish in sour soup, cured meat, ham and sausages…, the hosts toast the guests with rice wine and folk songs. Imagine hundreds of people sitting around a long table to share all the food and joy. Sounds fun, isn’t it? :) I didn’t get the chance to witness a big event like that, but only found this dining etiquette being applied in many restaurants in the village. In these festivals and celebrations, Miao people is also known for their colorful traditional singing and dancing. In my coming posts I’d love to share the video clips of their lively performance. .JPG) .JPG) ##The most typical architectures in Miao villages are the wooden stilted houses(Diao Jiao Lou 吊脚楼) and Wind &amp; Rain Bridges(Feng Yu Qiao 风雨桥), as you can see from my photos below. Like most visitors, I stayed in a beautiful guest house modified from a local building. The wooden stilted houses are usually built on a 30-70 degree mountain slope without any nails and rivets. What a smart way to fit into the environment, and it creates the magnificent views for both the inhabitants and people watching from afar. There are normally three floors in a building for different uses. The lowest floor is for raising poultry and livestock, storing tools, etc. The second floor is the living space, with central room, bedroom, kitchen and place for making embroidery. The top floor is used to store grain, fodder and other goods. .JPG) https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdKDtbdvUTcomCe5KJWjk7HYx1zAM7kP6C8C1gtL5iY6Z/IMG_9191.JPGhttps://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmP5FPczcxL5s5pf9baq2NcPvncgCZJBZ7b66fpQCampPq/IMG_9192.JPG .JPG) ##The five Wind &amp; Rain Bridges are crossing the main river in the village. They are popular venues for villagers as well as visitors to have a rest. Just like the rest, I loved enjoying the different but equally fabulous views from these bridges both during daytime and at night. They are built based on “Feng Shui” (风水) in Chinese culture to bring good luck and convenience to the locals. These bridges used to be built in wooden structures without any nails, but now they are rebuilt in more sturdy concrete and wood to withstand floods. .JPG) .JPG) ##I was walking along the Xijiang river that snakes through the village, and it’s sad to see the polluted unclear water. I witnessed some restaurants by the banks directly discharging waste water into the river: 我沿着穿寨而过的河流漫步，看到大部分河水很混浊，污染严重，痛心地发现不少两岸的餐馆就直接将污水排入河中：.JPG) ##Tourism has brought new opportunities for the Miao villagers, but I’ve seen locals stick to their traditional ways of living, not just for the tourists. .JPG) .JPG) .jpg) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) ##I had a chat with the sweet old lady from this hilltop guest house and batik workshop. She told me some interesting old traditions in their Miao villages, such as the sacrificial ceremony and agricultural meetings hosted by hereditary heads. She also recalled how she met her husband from her village nearby and moved here after marriage, and how things have changed since this place was listed as a cultural heritage site.

Braidwood is about 55 kilometres to Canberra, and it is the first town registered as a historic town in the New South Wales State register. It boasts quaint historic buildings, antique shops, fine restaurants and beautiful nature around. I found this lamp shop when we had a stopover in Braidwood, on a road trip during the past New Year holiday. 大家好！今天我来介绍一个澳洲小镇Braidwood一家不起眼的古董灯老店。这是前几个月新年假期的自驾途中偶然看到的，当时听了店主的传奇故事，觉得这个小店很有意思，就拍了几张照片，还在门口留影一张，觉得应该写一写，结果，拖延症晚期的我一拖又是几个月，直到今天看到@aaronli的“城事影像”活动的“老店”主题，才想起来找到这些照片，写下它的故事。Braidwood离首都堪培拉约55公里，是新南威尔士州最早注册为历史古城的小镇。作为历史上的淘金重镇，这儿有不少古意盎然的老建筑（相对于澳洲来说）、古玩店、餐厅酒吧等，周围还有很多小河小溪，不失为干旱地带的一片小小绿洲。 ##Since this antique shop was kind of hidden on a tree lined street, his owner Mr. Aernout placed this car at the town centre to attract visitors, and it worked. Later in his lamp shop, he asked us if we noticed this historic vehicle. And yes, that’s how we found his place: 因为这家古董灯店静静地藏在一条侧街边的树丛中，不容易被一般游客注意到，店主就把下面这辆拉风的老爷车放在镇中心的路口，旁边放着他的广告招牌吸引访客，这一招还挺灵，我们就是这么被吸引过去的： ##The Albion Cafe next to the sign serves great food and drinks, highly recommended too! 下面这家灯店广告牌后的咖啡馆就是我们吃午餐的地方，他家咖啡和简餐也很棒，但这期主题是老灯店，我就不放吃的照片啦手好痒： ##So we came to this antique lamp shop and met its owner Robert Aernout. This fun energetic man showed us around his shop and told stories about his past and the shop’s origin. 我们根据广告牌上的地址找到这家老店，见到了照片里的传奇店主 - 罗伯特 · 阿努特先生。老先生年近八旬仍然精力充沛，神采奕奕地向我们介绍了自己的古董灯店，还讲述了他一生的传奇经历。 ##Mr. Aernout was born in 1940 to Dutch parents on a tea plantation in East Java, Indonesia. His birth place is exotic enough, isn’t it? And it’s more than that. He spent the war years in Japanese P.O.W.(Prisoner Of War) camps, and left Indonesia in 1948 with his parents on an evacuation ship to Holland. Then he was educated in the Netherlands, but obviously he didn’t end up living in Europe but migrated to New Zealand in 1963. After 7 years, he came to Australia in 1970, and lived in Sydney for 20 years. So how did he turn to a collector and merchant of antique lamps? 阿努特先生1940年出生在印度尼西亚东爪洼岛的一处茶叶种植园，父母是荷兰人。是不是挺异域风情的？我听到这里脑海中已经上演好几幕殖民电影场景了，然而，接下来更精彩：二战期间，他在日军战俘营度过了童年，到1948年，又随父母坐着疏散的远洋轮船去了荷兰（简直又可以拍成好几部电影~）。在母国接受教育后，他并没有留在那里，而是在1963年又移民到了新西兰，果然会折腾，跟我有的一拼，听到这里对他好感度大增，哈哈。 我当时真的把他的口述飞快地打字记在了手机里，仿佛知道有这么一天会写下他的故事…… 真是有点记者八婆潜质啊~ 7年后，就像很多新西兰居民一样，他又从一块宁静安详的土地移居到不远处一块更加广袤荒芜的大陆 – 澳大利亚（看过电影《澳大利亚》没？）。从1970年起，他在悉尼一住就是20年，看来跟众多华人眼光一致呢，挑了个好地方。然而，故事还没完，否则怎么会有今天我写的这个老灯店？ In the early 1990s Mr. Aernout often travelled to Braidwood and he was fascinated with the Lake Bathurst Gallery, an 1830s slab timber cottage. So he bought it and started a collectible business specialising in vintage and antique lamps and replacement parts. Here in the shop, you can find everything from oil and kerosene lamps to oldwares. It’s like a little paradise for the lamp enthusiast or collector. In the showroom, there’s a complete range of rare and collectible lamps spanning 200 years of lighting. Besides, there are souvenirs and artworks from different parts of the world collected by Mr. Aernout. 九十年代初期，阿努特先生常常从悉尼去西南方向的Braidwood（布莱德伍德？），他被那里的一处画廊建筑迷住了，这是一间19世纪30年代的平板小木屋。最后他终于拔草，买下这处木屋（我竟然忘了给小木屋拍照，一定是外面太热，我出来后只匆匆在店牌前留了张“到此一游”照就跑路了，汗颜……），搬到这个鸟不拉屎的小镇，开始了自己的古董灯店生意彪悍的人生从来不需要解释，不是吗。在他的这家老店里（我知道，区区三十年不到历史的店对于来自中国的我来说能算老吗？但是这在澳洲真的是家老店啊~），各种老式油灯、煤油灯琳琅满目，还有其他老先生收藏的古物和世界各地的艺术品比如螺旋桨、头盔、铠甲、木雕、老桌椅之类，也让人目不暇接。 .JPG) ##The photo on the table of his shop was taken some decades ago. The younger Robert was behind Miller kerosene lamps dating back to 1895. It looks interesting together with the recent photo I took for him among his lamps. Time flies, while his passion and pursuit stay the same. According to Mr. Aernout: These lamps are called library and parlour lamps. The painted shades and fonts came in various flower designs and less ornate ones in plain white shades. A Number 2 burner was used with a round wick and gave around 80 candle power. Some of the other lamps are of French origin and also date back to the late 19th century. 下面放在他店里桌子上的黑白照片是几十年前年轻些的罗伯特，在1895年的一群米勒老煤油灯前拍的。是不是跟我上面给他拍的那张形成有趣的对比？光阴荏苒，不变的是那颗热爱古董灯的心…… 根据他的说法： 这些古董灯一般用在图书馆或客厅。有些灯罩上有各种彩绘的花纹图案，还有些白色灯罩的比较素淡。使用圆形灯芯的2号灯头，烛光功率80左右。其中还有一些灯来自19世纪的法国。 ##He told us his collection of antiques was also used as props in some old films, and he showed us a few movie posters in which he played roles. Before we left, he recommended a creek nearby to dip into. It’s a life saver in the incredibly hot and dry weather! 他说自己收集的这些年代久远的老灯具还被一些老电影用来当作道具使用，并给我们看了他年轻时饰演的一些电影角色的海报。我们又聊到开车来的路上看到头被撞死的袋熊，他就跟我们讲了些当地的各种动物。最后，我们跟他告别前，他还推荐了附近一处可以泡冷水的小溪，真是贴心 – 这在这种酷暑天和这块极度干热的地区简直是救命稻草啊~ 好了，老灯店就聊到这里，去游泳啦…… 先吃个冰淇淋（不好意西，还是没忍住发吃的，但是一只手没拿稳手机，拍虚了，哈哈）： 再游泳（老先生推荐的小溪还不错哦~ 如果我照片里找到的是他所说的那条的话 这块地区真是干得可以 很多草木都是针叶状 好可怜 分分钟渴死的节奏 然而彪悍的植物人生也是不需要怜悯的 老天自有安排不是吗）： ##All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for reading.

Today I’m going to ramble a bit about food. As a Chinese having lived in Asia, Europe, South America, the Caribbeans and Australia, my food experience is pretty extensive, and I enjoy a wide variety of food. I don’t want to say “East or West, home food is the best”, too narrow-minded, isn’t it? ;) There are so many delicacies all over the world. But still, Asian food is something I cook and eat the most often, not because it’s the best, but because I’m more familiar with its cooking. By Asian food, I don’t mean Chinese food or Cantonese food, but food I tried in Asian countries.  And I have to point out that Cantonese food is always mistaken as typical Chinese food, just because there is a large number of Cantonese immigrants overseas. Look at the strange mushy meat wrapped in dark soy sauce, sometimes even with broccoli, yuuucky… no it’s not Chinese food, not even genuine Cantonese one. In fact, there are so many different cuisines in China besides the Cantonese one.  So when I occasionally miss Asian food in a Western kind of country, what do I do? Aha~ I play with the food: ##And I burn the bread (look at the head picture)! Too much bread in the Western diet! Haha, just kidding! So what’s the black stuff? No worries, it’s black garlic bread, and what next to it are brown butter and burnt vanilla. You see there’s really something burnt!  They look a bit like a devil, but taste divine. The multi-seed bagel with pastrami and fried egg is also delectable.  下面是澳洲布里斯班/本南岸一家名为Gauge的餐厅吃的brunch，很黑暗有木有？ 友情提醒：中英文是互补不是互译的，因为想说的太多，而且受众不同（说得好像真有多少人看一样），哈哈 https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmU4MiEmxHxRbu8mbzv51iBYMZX5andPAiMtpUWap8hjqm/IMG_1642.JPG This place - Gauge was recommended by a local friend from Brisbane. Located just across the street from the South Bank’s art precinct, it is café by day and restaurant by night. According to the AU Review: It is a small and unassuming cafe/restaurant that produces a Michelin-star quality food at reasonable prices. Jerome Batten is the man behind Gauge, a role he juggles while also helming Sourced Grocer, a cafe and grocer in Newstead. For both, the focus is on local, quality produce – with each kitchen’s own flair for originality. From their menu, you can see lots of creative options with Australian ingredients, such as kangroo consommé and quandong (one of the best known bushfoods - a native peach widely dispersed throughout the central deserts and southern areas of Australia). 当地朋友推荐的这家食肆还是挺赞的~ 新鲜的季节性原料，创新的烹饪手法，浓郁的本土特色，有袋鼠肉汤、澳洲特有的丛林食材 – 框档果（曾是土著居民的主要食物，被文玩商引入中国时炒作为佛螺菩提太会掰了）等很多选择。点的几个小盘不说色香味俱佳，起码口感不错，尤其黑色蒜香土司抹上黄油、配上烤焦的香草，吃起来唇齿留香，意犹未尽。旁边的改良贝果面包搭着五香酱牛肉末和鸡蛋，味道也很独特。有专业评论称这家是“米其林的品质，平民的价格”。 Their dinner menu(it’s seasonal, so it can be different):他家晚餐的菜单（随季节变动）:他家晚餐的菜单（随季节变动）:他家晚餐的菜单（随季节变动）: A great cuppa coffee afterwards:吃完来杯咖啡，味道不错哦:吃完来杯咖啡，味道不错哦:吃完来杯咖啡，味道不错哦: The quality of coffee and the barista culture is a big thing in Australia. Aussies love their coffee. So when a place takes coffee seriously like this one, plenty of locals are willing to wait from its opening time. Some Aussies love to laugh at Starbucks that can’t live up to the high-quality coffee standards they hold, like the same brand didn’t stand a chance to break into the Italian market (It’s said the first Starbucks shop is finally due to open later this year in downtown Milano). 澳大利亚，尤其是墨尔本这样的地方是以注重咖啡品质而闻名的，个中原因又可以另写一篇。你可能要问，澳洲早先是英国佬的地盘，这帮人不是喝茶的主儿吗？长话短说，就是1928年，墨尔本的一家咖啡厅率先配备了意式浓缩咖啡机，从此，曾经沧海难为水，除却espresso不是咖，☕ 一切都不一样了。接着咖啡机又传到悉尼，喝浓咖啡的习惯渐渐在澳洲社会流传开来。 二战后，政府放宽了咖啡进口和移民政策，于是乎，不仅大量的咖啡豆，还有大量的意大利和希腊移民涌入这块广袤荒芜却又闪着希望的大陆。有了这群酷爱咖啡的意呆利人和希腊人（冰咖啡frappé就是希腊人在1957年捣鼓出来的），一家家南欧风情咖啡馆便在悉尼等地的郊区遍地开花。 咖啡豆要现磨，咖啡要汽压煮，咖啡师要经过专业训练来掌握这门艺术，想不好喝都难。就跟意大利人一样，澳洲人也热衷于嘲笑美国的星巴克，说人家达不到自己对咖啡的高标准。2000年，星巴克雄心勃勃地在全澳开了84家，结果用不了十年几乎全部关停。在这个全球泛滥着星巴克咖啡的时代，意大利硬是抵制这美国品牌直到今天，但据说今年晚些时候会在米兰市中心的邮政大楼里开张第一家，我还去过那座古色古香的邮政大楼，不禁想到当年故宫星巴克的去留之争，呵呵，只能边吃瓜边拭目以待啦。 除了对咖啡很讲究的意大利法国葡萄牙等欧洲国家，我还有幸访问过巴西、越南、哥伦比亚这世界前三大咖啡出口国，也在加勒比、埃塞俄比亚等有名的咖啡产区尝过不少咖啡，希望遥远不久的将来也可以和大家分享这些经历。不知不觉竟然又扯了这么多，吃货的真爱啊~ ❤ ##The head picture also serves as an entry to Foodboasting Photo Contest by @karenmckersie.

So I’m going to blog about my epic trans-Siberian journey in the following days. In this post, I would start from my first stop of the long journey - Moscow. These photos you see were shot at sunset close to Gorky Park. On this lovely summer day, the locals are resting or dancing by the charming Moskva River snaking through the city. Warm season is not long here, so beautiful sunny days like this are so precious. The bridge you see is Pushkinsky Pedestrian Bridge completed in 2000, built around the old steel arch of the historical Andreyevsky Rail Bridge (1907-1998).https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZ5aKtSoBDm6REfReJrZX9JLxtZRirMVLZ8pYCtm6nyzs/m1.JPGBefore I went to Russia, all my impressions about it were only from books, TV news, movies and a couple of Russian friends. Just like China or any other countries, foreigners can have misconceptions about Russia. I still remember when I was doing a master in Belgium, we had a Russian girl in the same major, and whenever she stopped drinking in a hangout, the rest would say: “Hey, you are from Russia! How can you drink so little? Don’t you drink vodka like water?” Or things like:”What? You call this cold? Don’t you have frozen lakes most time of the year there in Russia?” Haha… So travel is your best friend. Seeing is believing. Just go out there and see with your own eyes. :) https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmXEQ16fqtW6LSm1g9uv86N7b72o5rqJ2UAdr7eWnqXWCZ/m0.jpg So I hopped on the trans-Siberian train and started my 7-day journey through Russia? No no no, it’s way more exciting! ;) First, I have to apply for the visa of course. Should it be a transit one then? When I checked the train routes, I found out that rather than taking the famous 7-day trans-Siberian train (see the red route in the map below), I should actually do the trans-Mongolian route to Beijing. Why? Because I’m going to East China and I’d love to visit Mongolia too! Image source: But if you take that popular trans-Siberian train for a week, you stay in one train for 7 days without getting out or taking showers, which is a bit gruesome to me on hot summer days. ;) At last, I opted for separate legs of train, so I could get out and see different places in Russia and Mongolia. Then I had to get a tourist visa instead of a transit visa. I also decided to do couchsurfing, which was as awesome as always. Like many travelers, I’ve loved this way of going local. All my hosts in Russia were amazing, and every one of them took me to meet their friends or other couchsurfing mates. We had so much fun! So after the visa and the accommodation were sorted out, I first flew from Brussels to Moscow, and after a week in Moscow, I took a couple of trains all the way to Ulaanbaatar of Mongolia, and then to Beijing, China. It turned out to be such a wonderful journey full of great memories. When I’m now looking at the photos and videos filled with culture, nature and laughter, I just can’t help smiling. In my next post about this Trans-Siberian journey, join me in a boat tour down the Moscow River! Stay tuned and see you soon! =) https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVj2wkg65bWVkTfrNW43WZrygRrk3ruzC11xhTvD8mVoC/M4.JPG ##All content by @itchyfeetdonica except for the map Thank you for reading.

Today I’m showing you some interesting facts behind the architectural wonder - Golden Gate Bridge, based on my trip to San Francisco, USA(all photos from myself), inspired by @aaronli’s A City a Story photo contest themed “Bridge”. Also, @kimzwarch and his team is running a cool project – Archisteem &amp; Placestoremember. Check out their pages and join the fun! Outlook &amp; Location 外观 &amp; 环境 First, let’s see how this beloved symbol of San Francisco looks like during daytime when it’s sunny. It was a warm clear day when I took these photos, which was not so common according to my local hosts. Since this area is often shrouded in heavy fog, the consulting architect Irving Morrow selected an orange vermilion color (aka. international orange) to enhance the bridge’s visibility in fog and to complement the natural surroundings. Because the bay was always covered in fog, the early European explorers who sailed along the coast in the 16th century didn’t even notice its entrance. Only after 200 years, another exploration party finally found the strait. This popular foggy bridge has even been closed three times because of weather. 今天要带大家一起看看美国西海岸旧金山这座世界闻名的拉索大桥 – 金门大桥。先来两张风和日丽时拍下的照片。听当地的沙发主人们说，这种阳光和煦的日子并不常见，通常大桥都是笼罩在浓雾之中。因为海湾这里总是雾蒙蒙一片，能见度低，建筑师欧文莫罗就给大桥外观选择了独特的橙红色（国际橙色），方便人们雾里看桥，也好和周遭的绿树青山相映成趣。由于湾区这里总是被笼在雾气中，早期16世纪的欧洲探险者航行到这片海域时，竟然都没留意到这里有个入口（好一个笼在深雾人不识）。直到200年后的18世纪，另外一个探险队才终于发现了这个海峡。金门大桥还曾因为恶劣的天气难以通行而被关闭过三次。 不用自行脑补这大雾弥漫的场景，下面有图有真相。=) Here’s a postcard I bought at the souvenir shop to mail to my mom. Together with the following two photos done by professional photographers, you can see the spectacular views of the Golden Gate Bridge at sunset and at night: 从下面我买的明信片和专业摄影师拍的照片上，可以一窥金门大桥在黄昏和夜晚时的美景。看到全景照第一张里排山倒海的大雾了吗？ 当时写完明信片我就赶紧拍照取证，因为在那之前寄回家的明信片有的没收到，最后我都不记得寄过什么了，旅途教训啊~ ##This famous bridge connects San Francisco with Marin County of California to the north. But it’s almost mission impossible to build a bridge like this in the early 20th century. Why? Look at the strait that connects the San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean (see the map below), let me tell you - it is over 2000 meters wide, and the water is 150 meters deep in the center! And its water is subject to strong, swirling currents due to the tides moving in and out of the bay. Together with the gusting winds and heavy fog here, you can imagine how hard it is to build a bridge across the Golden Gate (this name was given by an American explorer because it reminded him of the “Golden Horn” near Istanbul) during that period of time. .jpg) ## History &amp; Statistics 历史 &amp; 数据 After the discovery of gold in California in 1848, San Francisco quickly became a major city with its fine harbor and great location out on a peninsula. And its growth was slowed by the lack of bridge as it’s developing. In 1916, a proposal for a bridge prompted San Francisco’s city engineer, Michael M. O’Shaughnessy to make his estimate. At last, the bridge engineer Joseph Strauss came up with a sturdy cantilever bridge design, with an estimated cost of $17 million. However, no budget was available for this bridge until 1928 when the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District was formed to actually finance it. In 1929, the new design was finally set after some consulting engineers suggested to modify Joseph Strauss’s cantilever bridge to a full suspension bridge with sweeping lines. In the January of 1933, the construction began, and it was completed in 1937 at a cost of $35 million, twice of the initial cost predicted by Strauss. It was the longest suspension bridge in the world until 1964 when Japan’s Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge was built. In 1994, the American Society of Civil Engineers named the bridge one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World. .jpg) .jpg) ##Once a poet described the Golden Gate Bridge as: A cruve of soaring steel, graceful and confident over infinity. What a beautiful description of this architectural marvel! Miles of wire, tons of steel, thousands of rivets were used in building this astonishing beauty. Now let’s check out the staggering statistics: .jpg) .jpg) ## Fun &amp; Sad Facts 奇闻轶事 As I mentioned earlier, the architect Irving Morrow, selected the International Orange color to paint the whole bridge. In fact, this color was originally meant only to be a sealant for the steel. Thanks to him, the unique color has contributed to the popularity of this most photographed bridge. The bridge’s deck was very high, so Joseph Strauss designed a safety net suspended under the bridge to catch the construction crew who could possibly lose their balance. This net did save several lives, but near the end of construction in 1937, a 5-ton work platform fell from the bridge into the net along with 10 workers. Sadly, the safety net gave way and the workers drowned. Nowadays the tragedy still happens, but not by accident. There are suicide hotline telephones on the bridge, since around 30 depressed souls commit suicide by jumping off the span each year. And the heavy fog and strong currents make dead bodies unnoticed. Ellis, a key member of the design team who designed “every nut and bolt on the darn thing” was fired part way through the project by Strauss, but he was obsessed with the bridge, and continued working on its necessary calculations by hand on his own time. This is true love. The cables of Golden Gate Bridge were made by the same company that built the Brooklyn Bridge(fuzzily pictured below) of New York City. Strong cables were needed to support the structure and bend long in the crazy winds, so Strauss turned to the expert company which made the cables for the Brooklyn Bridge 52 years earlier. They developed a method called parallel wire construction for Golden Gate Bridge. https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmW7bM7omgZbmP92MRDau34zzSrpKVNaQXYE45HLEbXfZw/IMG_1698.jpghttps://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmatSFZC27p9trBS6byPJqnzSSbfyg3iNetFotvqgFsPWE/07D6AC80-DA39-4047-A007-8206121EB17B.jpeg ##The equally famous Brooklyn Bridge in New York City is a hybrid cable-stayed/suspension bridge. It’s a pity that I didn’t take any decent photos of the Brooklyn Bridge at night when I went through it. What I could find now is only a blurry tourist photo shot on it, so here it is, together with my tourist photo in front of the Golden Gate Bridge. Sorry I only got unnatural boring posing photos by random passerby’s when traveling alone there, haha. Or try some selfies like this lovely girl: ##I also did a post before about the amazing old bridge in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, check it out if you are interested. =) 西海岸这座金门大桥让我想到了美帝另外一座同样有名的大桥，那就是东海岸纽约的布鲁克林大桥。这两座桥的拉索也来自同一家公司（上面英文有提到，有空我会翻译）。可惜当时几次都是晚间匆匆经过，没有好好拍大桥，只找到一张请路人帮忙拍的傻乎乎的游客照（上方右图）。左图为另一张傻乎乎的金门大桥前的游客照。一个人的旅行比较难有自然瞬间的照片，大都是找路人帮忙摆拍，只能对着镜头傻笑，其中甘苦我在这个帖子里提到过，哈哈。或者也可以像上图中那个可爱的小女孩一样陶醉自拍~ ;) ##还曾经写过波黑的一座很有味道的老桥，有兴趣的也可以看看~ Thank you for reading.

Today I’m showing you some thousand-year-old Monkey Puzzle trees from Nahuelbuta National Park in Chile. The 3 monochrome photos are my entries to @daveks’ B&amp;W Photo Contest themed Trees. Check out his page and join the fun! 大家好，今天请跟我来看看智利中部一处国家公园里的千年土著圣树 – 南美杉。 .jpg) This national park is located in the beautiful La Araucanía Region in central Chile. Araucaria araucana is the name of the trees in this park. A more common name is “Monkey Puzzle/Tail” tree, or “Chilean pine”. Nahuelbuta literally means “big tiger” in Mapuche language, and it is a sanctuary for Monkey Puzzle trees (the national tree of Chile) which are sacred to the Mapuche native American tribes. The monkey puzzle trees in Chile look like the Bunya trees in southern Queensland where I live, which I will blog about soon. Interestingly enough, just like the sacred monkey puzzle trees to Mapuche people, Bunya trees are also valuable resources for the aboriginals in Australia. They were fiercely protected by the Aborigines, which led to colonial authorities prohibiting European settlers from cutting the trees in the 19th century. 这个国家公园(自然保护区)叫Nahuelbuta，来源于土著马普切人的语言，意为”大老虎”。这个”大老虎”守护着一大片土著人心目中的圣树 – 智利南美杉。这种杉树是智利的国树，俗称”智利松”或”迷猴树”，可能是因为它奇特的外形，让爬树的猴子都觉得迷惑吧 :)。 .jpg) These trees are native to the Chilean and Argentinian south-central Andes, typically above 1,000 meters. They are also popularly grown as ornamental trees. Some of these living fossils date back 2,000 years, and can grow up to 40 meters high, like the Sky Tree in Southwest China. Monkey Puzzle trees is the hardiest species in the conifer genus Araucaria. The scale-like triangular leaves are thick and tough with sharp edges and tips. .jpg) ## ## .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) ##You can explore the 30 roads and 15 trails in the park by car or on foot. We visited this park on a road trip from the city Concepción where we lived. After a few hours’ hike along scenic and muddy paths, we reached the peak - Cerro Piedra del Águila before sunset. Most photos you see from my post were taken at the peak, where on a big rock there was only a tiny uneven surface for our foothold. Standing at 1,379 meters in the middle of nowhere in the chilly wind, I was totally stunned by the breathtaking view of the exuberant and pristine monkey puzzle trees all over the mountain ranges, with a few extra tall ones sticking out in front. And it’s more than that - to the west it’s the immense Pacific Ocean, and to the east an impressive chain of Andean volcanoes. All these framed the sky marked by spectacular hues. We three sat on the tip of the big rock in awe, watching the postcard view in peaceful solitude. But it was getting really cold and windy when the sun eventually left us, and it’s harder and harder to breathe. So we reluctantly hiked down the peak when it’s almost dark. .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) ##All content by @itchyfeetdonica (the screenshot from Google Map)图文 by Donica多 Thank you for reading.

I’m doing this post to apply for the Chinese translator role of the open-source projects by @utopian-io and @davinci.witness. I’m Donica, a Chinese native studied and worked in different continents in this global village. Why do I apply for it?Translation has always been my passion. It’s why I chose to study language and communication, and I have been working in this field for over 11 years ever since my last year in university. It’s not just my interest, but also something happening daily in my work and life. When I’m blogging on Steemit, I opt for both English and Chinese as well. It is a natural flow that I truly enjoy. I love the freedom of communicating in more than one language. Besides English, I learnt a bit German, French, Dutch and Spanish. It has improved my overall language acquisition and has opened up so many doors to other cultures.For me, it’s fun, meaningful and rewarding to bridge the gap for different language users by translating, and it’s more than the language itself, it’s about the culture too. I have been working in startup incubators in 4 different continents with people from all over the world. So I got to know a bit about coding and open-source projects when I created websites for our startup, and I have enjoyed working with these intelligent developers and have learned a lot from them. Working on open-source projects is cool, and to help spread the coolness to Chinese community is no less cool. Who doesn’t want to contribute to something double cool? At least I’d love to. Plus there’s possible rewards - who hates upvotes?Last but not least, I adore Da Vinci. I know this sounds irrelevant , but when I saw the name of this witness, I just couldn’t help casting my vote for it (just kidding - I read their mission too, and I love Italy ;)…). I have been mesmerized by the masterpieces from this universal genius, and I love reading about him and his works (see the photos I took for this post). I don’t have such diverse talents like him, but I guess I have the same kind of unquenchable curiosity and pursuit for perfection, which is a good thing for translation.##It’s not just my passion, I have a solid background in translation and extensive working experience too (here comes more boasting):Academic Background &amp; Professional Training I majored in Business English &amp; Cross-culture Communication. The Master study I did in Europe was taught in English - in the course of Online Publishing, I built a Drupal site with other international students. I had both university courses and professional training in translation and interpretation between English and Chinese. And since 2007 I have been qualified as an advanced-level translator &amp; interpreter with Shanghai HR Credentials for Special Expertise. I also have certificates of TOEIC (Test of English for International Communication) and IELTS (International English Language Testing System). Relevant Work Experiences I used to translate for the international section of a newspaper and for a bilingual expat magazine in China. I’ve been translating product design drawings, brochures, IP documents, movie subtitles, etc. Besides translation, I have been doing consecutive interpretation between Mandarin and English in various occasions in different countries, such as at marketing &amp; sales conferences and trade fairs, for delegates’ visits to Ministries, companies, plants and for sightseeing… My working experience in bilingual language and culture training for both Chinese and international trainees also helped in my language proficiency and cultural understanding. Some References As I mentioned above, I do bilingual posts here on Steemit, so feel free to check out my page and ask me for more translation samples I did before. I can also offer recommendation letters from expat managers who learnt Chinese with me. Here are some of my Steemit posts upvoted by the curation teams of @curie/ @ocd, so you can have a peek of my writing in both languages: Paint with Donica - 4 Treasures of Chinese PaintingExploring Comuna 13 of MedellínExplore Easter Island with Me (1) Besides, I contribute weekly to the cross-culture project @cn-reader initiated by @rivalhw. Here’s the most recent bilingual post I did for it: Poppy Flowers &amp; Opium ##It’s my first time applying for a vacancy with either @utopian-io or @davinci.witness, so I did it in details. I hope it’s not too much with all the “CV + motivation letter” like content ;). If you want to know even more about me, here’s my intro post. Thank you for your time! Exchange makes change. Look forward to the sparks. =) ##Audio Track photo by @itchyfeetdonica 缘起 一直觉得语言是一种工具，所以没有强调过这个专业背景，在Steemit上也是发业余爱好的旅行、摄影比较多，偶尔画个小画、做个小吃或手工什么的。直到最近看到乌托邦翻译项目重新启动，突然醒悟原来我也可以试试重操旧业嘛。 我有幸住过5大洲，游荡过60多国，因为对语言文化兴趣浓厚，加上专业的学习培训和翻译经验，工作环境又一直国际化，中英文间的自由切换还算自然。同时，学的那点三脚猫水平的德语、法语、荷兰语和西班牙语也加深了对中西文化差异的感受。翻译同语言文化密不可分，可以用自己的兴趣和专长来帮助他人弥合语言文化的差异，对我来说总是充满乐趣和成就感。 在世界各地的孵化项目工作期间，还有为初创公司建网站时，我常和各国聪明可爱的程序猿们一起合作交流，从中了解到一些编程和开源项目的皮毛。现在看到达芬奇和乌托邦合作的翻译计划，觉得如果能借此机会，把美妙的开源项目翻译成汉语，给中文使用者提供便利，该是多么美妙的一件事。而且发挥自己专长的同时，还有可能获得“巨额”点赞，何乐而不为呢？ 最后还有一个原因可能有点不着边际，但是我看到这个项目是由“达芬奇”团队负责，立刻心生好感，因为在我心目中，达芬奇是位前无古人说不定也后无来者的多领域跨界奇才，一个科学家和艺术家完美的结合体。身边就有很多关于他的书籍资料，比如我拍的这些插图里的书。虽然我没有他那么超凡的才华，但同样强烈的好奇心和严谨的态度也会让我在翻译这条道上走得更远。;) 光说自己热爱也没用，下面开始吹嘘专业背景和工作经验: =) 内幕 本科期间主修商务英语跨文化交际方向，专业八级。在欧洲读的研究生为英文授课，其间和其他国际学生一起做过Drupal网站。 大学学过系统的口笔译课程。大四时通过了高级口译考试，有上海高级口译证书。 当然还考过六级、托业、雅思之类的（好像有点扯，但找活干不是流行列出各证书吗 ;) ） 笔译方面，翻过报纸国际版和双语杂志的各题材文章，还有产品设计图、技术专利申请、电影字幕等。 口译方面，还没进过同传的黑箱子，但英汉交替传译经验丰富，比如市场销售会议、展会、陪同访问部委、公司、工厂、导游观光等。 多年的英语和对外汉语培训经验，以及近年来的国际市场传播工作也对促进语言习得、加深文化认识和提高翻译水平大有裨益（看看我这书面语用的……）。 实例 由于我在Steemit发表的博文大都是双语写的，所以欢迎评委翻翻我的主页，或者问我要之前专业翻译的样稿。如有必要，我也可以提供对外汉语学员的推荐信。下面是几篇被@curie或@ocd团队点赞过的文章，也许可以一窥我的双语写作： 来画国产动画角色 + 文房四宝小知识探索哥伦比亚毒枭老巢的贫民窟复活节岛摩托之旅（一） 我每周还为大伟哥@rivalhw牵头的@cn-reader跨文化项目发表一到两篇文章，这是最新一期的双语样文，供参考：罂粟花 &amp; 鸦片 ##这是我第一次在Steemit上公开申请工作，不清楚分寸，索性写得比较详细。如果你觉得很像求职信加简历，那恭喜你答对了！ 如果你还想了解更多觉得眼睛受到的伤害不够，这里有我的自我介绍贴 。感谢你读到这里，记得留言分享你的想法哦！ Thank you for reading.

So are you also wondering what the connection is with the Italian city? The tobacco millionaire Abbot Kinney founded this seaside resort town in 1905, in the vision of building a “pleasure pier” in California that boasted Venetian architecture of Italy. It was originally called the “Venice of America”, in the hope that visitors could ride gondolas to tour the water town just like in Venice of Europe. Later in 1926, Venice merged with Los Angeles, but the area kept its bohemian vibe and is known as a cultural hub today. I found it a lively and peculiar place full of strange charm. People come here for attractions like Abbot Kinney Boulevard, Recreation Center, the Venice Canals, and of course the beach. I heard it can get packed during hot summer time, since it’s very popular among tourists as well as locals. While I visited it on a cool spring day, there’s no crowds at the beach. From late afternoon till dark, I walked the long Boardwalk to reach the famous Santa Monica Pier. I was lucky to witness the color changes of the sky along my way.

It is commonly sold as street food and cooked in outdoor gatherings, like the beloved barbie by Aussies and the churrasco across Latin America and Europe. ## ##题图里的烤肉串在俄罗斯街头很常见，是我在莫斯科的一个美食节上拍的。当时循着四溢的肉香，发现这位中亚装束的小哥在卖这种面包夹烤肉，就买了一份尝了个鲜，味道不错。烤肉的火候恰到好处，外焦里嫩，新鲜的面包带着芝麻的香气，一起吃到嘴里很有满足感。估计他是来自乌兹别克斯坦之类的某个斯坦国，因为在俄罗斯各地看到不少乌兹别克斯坦人开的烤肉餐馆。 这种肉串通常被叫作Shashlik，来自突厥语，意为“可以串起来的”。早在16世纪的时候，哥萨克人就从克里米亚鞑靼人那里借用了这个词，而一直到19世纪末期，这种烤肉串的吃法才传到了莫斯科，然后逐渐风靡全俄罗斯。除了街头和餐馆卖这种肉串，人们在户外聚会时也常常立起烤肉架，就像澳洲人钟爱的户外烧烤barbie和拉美盛行的烤肉churrasco一样，一边烤着吃，一边喝酒聊天，好不快活。=） 这类Shashlik在中亚、东欧、高加索地区、波罗的海各国还有中东的伊朗、以色列、土耳其等地都很受欢迎。其他国家也有类似的烤肉串，只是大小、调料、腌制方法、口味等不尽相同，比如中国的串儿写得我此刻好想撸串儿、意大利的arrosticini、法国和西班牙加泰罗尼亚地区的小烤串brochette（这两种跟中国常见的苗条娇小类肉串最相似，比较入味。个人认为这几个西南欧国家在吃方面完胜德国荷兰英国之类的中西北欧同伴）、秘鲁等安第斯地区的串烧anticuchos（有牛肉鸡肉等，以牛心最为普遍，起初我还有些抵触，觉得吃心太可怕了，后来在一些偏僻的安第斯山区实在没的吃，只能天天吃这个，发现薄薄的切片烤得挺脆嫩，其实完全没有内脏的气味，口感类似鸡胗，蘸着摊主给的辣酱，就着烤土豆吃，很是美味。可见人一旦被逼到绝境，真是什么都做的出来啊，连吃心都成了家常便饭……）。 ##下面进入正题 – 预测2018俄罗斯世界杯的半决赛结果。因为不懂足球，但又不想太水，所以扯了扯更加了解的主办地和全球各地类似的美食，哈哈哈。。。想玩的小伙伴可以点下面链接看看游戏规则，一起来猜吧！:) ##Russia 2018 World Cup is coming to the exciting stage of semi finals tomorrow!

It is “Street Art” this week. There are various forms of street art including graffiti, posters, sculptures, stickers, urban knitting, installations, etc.. Since I lived in Latin America, my eyes got used to a feast of colorful street murals from big cities to tiny towns. Even in the hidden gems underdogs like Belgium, there are creative street comics of Tintin’s adventures. But I have to choose one from the numerous, so I’ll first go for a type of unique Asian style – the murals on a couple of back streets in Malacca, Malaysia. Malaysia is a charming multicultural destination boasting Malay, Chinese, Indian and other cultures. I have visited a few places there and have always wanted to go back. I was surprised to see so many stunning street murals in cities like Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Ipoh and Malacca. Among those street art works, the best known one might be the mural in old town Penang – “Brother &amp; Sister on a Bicycle” painted by the Lithuanian artist Ernest Zacharevic. ##我看到这期的“城事影像”主题时，立马陷入选择困难症的泥沼 。 这周的主题是“街头艺术”，街头艺术形式多样，比如有涂鸦、海报、雕塑、贴纸、纺织装饰品、装置艺术等。光是涂鸦，这些年就见到太多，尤其是拉丁美洲那无处不在的街头壁画，大都色彩鲜艳、意象奇特、水平高超，以喷绘比较常见。就连比利时这种常被嘲笑无趣的欧洲小国，街头也有《丁丁历险记》的巨幅漫画涂鸦。 但这么多街头艺术，我选哪里来写呢？想想还是从咱们亚洲开始吧，今天就来介绍大马的马六甲一处东方风味浓郁的街头壁画。 马来西亚是个很有意思的国家，融汇了马来人、华人和印度人等的多元文化，从自然到美食都洋溢着南洋的热带风情。是一个我去了几次还总想再去的目的地。在那里时发现很多城镇的街头都闪耀或者暗藏着缤纷的涂鸦，比如首都吉隆坡、槟城、怡保、马六甲等。其中可能以槟城老城区的街头壁画最为闻名，立陶宛的艺术家恩尼斯特绘制的姐弟共骑单车的那幅画，每次经过都有游客在大排长龙等候合影。 ##The street murals are also common in Malacca, this historical city rich in heritage buildings, ancient landmarks and colonial structures. With influences from different cultures like Portuguese, Dutch, British, Japanese, Javanese and Chinese ones, this is a great place to visit. I have to write about its amazing food too, but today let me first focus on the mural art. The most prominent mural art works here can be seen on both sides of the lovely canal. And when I walked into a few small streets with my mom, I discovered more gems. :) Unlike the constant long line of visitors in front of the “Brother &amp; Sister on a Bicycle”, only us two were here. Look at the pictures I shot: these murals are so full of life – working men and resting women, children and animals playing around, all vividly depicted in bright colors with a cheerful tone. It is fun to have a peek into the locals’ life through these lively daily scenes. At the same time, the subjects in these paintings are reflecting the multi-culture feature of Malaysia. ##马六甲的街头涂鸦也很普遍，尤其是运河两岸的建筑墙面上的书法和绘画作品很引人注目。受到葡萄牙、荷兰、英国、日本殖民以及爪洼、中华等文化的影响，这个以马六甲海峡著称的历史小城地方不大，却处处是古迹。走在那些古色古香的小巷弄间，时光仿佛都慢下了脚步~。 我带着母后逛到这条僻静的小街上，发现墙面上也有不少精致的壁画。这些写实风格的画面色调温暖、明亮欢快、生趣盎然，相较拉美流行的风格，少了份浓烈奔放，多了些质朴醇厚。那些干着体力活或脑力活的男人、窗口小憩的主妇、嬉戏玩耍的孩童，还有栩栩如生的动物们，无一不展现着真实自然的生活气息。而且涂鸦的主题和人物也和大马的国情一样，渗透着多元文化的因素。文化多元可能会带来种种问题，而这也正是它的迷人之处。 Here are some more photos taken at the pretty streets nearby: cats are as common as graffiti: 附近的小巷是长这个样子的，很有味道对不对？除了街头壁画，喵星人也随处可见： ##I used the flower &amp; wall picture I took here to make 2 headers in Chinese and in English. Though it’s not easy to write on screen with fingertips, I just had too much fun in playing with it ;), so I made 4 ones (see another 2 above )with the post title and my signature. What do you think of them? Perhaps I should just hand-write post titles on my photo works in future? :D 我在给这面绿墙和红花拍的照片上写了几个字做封面，虽然用指尖在屏幕上写字不容易，但写上瘾了，一口气写了四张 ，哈哈哈~ 我是不是太神经了…… 小伙伴们你们觉得这个主意怎么样？干脆我以后就直接在照片上写文章标题算了？ It happened to be the Hungry Ghost Festival when I was at Malacca, so I witnessed some local ethnic Chinese preparing ritualistic food offerings, and burning incense and joss paper for the visiting spirits of their deceased ancestors. ## * Hungry Ghost Festival is a traditional Buddhist and Taoist festival in Chinese culture. The seventh month of Chinese lunar calendar is regarded by older generation as the Ghost Month, and the 14th or 15th day of the month is called Ghost Day.Similar to Halloween from the Western culture, during the Ghost Festival, the spirits of the deceased are believed to visit the living from the lower realm. They search food and take revenge upon those who wronged them in life. While in the Qingming Festival in spring and Double Ninth Festival in autumn, it’s the other way around - living descendants pay homage to their deceased ancestors.Except for burning paper objects such as houses, furniture and cars for their deceased families, people also pay tribute to other wandering ghosts so that these homeless souls do not bring bad luck or misfortune. 在马六甲时正巧碰上七月半中元节（鬼节，佛教中的盂兰盆节），所以看到一些当地的华裔在为逝去的先祖准备贡品，还有焚烧香火纸钱之类的以祭奠亡灵。.jpg) So that’s it for today’s post about the murals and some back streets in Malacca, Malaysia. Here are a few more posts I did before which are relevant to street art, check them out if interested : 今天关于马六甲街头壁画的介绍就先到这里，下面是些我以前写的跟街头涂鸦有关的旧帖： Caminito in Buenos Aires, Argentina 阿根廷首都的卡米尼托区 Street Art &amp; Sultan Mosque in Singapore 新加坡的街头涂鸦和苏丹清真寺 Comuna 13 of Medellín, Colombia 哥伦比亚毒枭老巢的贫民窟 Colorful Olinda, Brazil 巴西的多彩海滨小镇奥林达 All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for reading.

I visited this amazing place 4 years ago, and I only started to sort through my photos just now because I happened to see a couple of photo contests today: the Thursday #colourfulphotography by @juliank; Birds of Flight - Deranged Photography Contests by @derangedvisions; Shadow Photo Contest by @melinda010100, with the theme “Giant Shadows” this round proposed by @nolasco; If you are also a photography enthusiast, check out the pages of these great Steemians and join the photo fun! =) ##I shot these photos on a hot air balloon ride above Cappadocia, a semi-arid region in Central Anatolia, best known for its unique moon-like landscape and unusual rock formations. The formation of this strange landscape started during the third geological period, when three volcanoes located on the edges of this region began erupting frequently. Here you can also find underground cities, cave churches and houses carved in the rocks. ##在这篇博文和下一篇里，请大家跟随我的照片，来一场奇幻的热气球之旅。 卡帕多奇亚是土耳其安纳托利亚中部的一块半干旱地区，以奇特的岩石构造、岩洞和半隐居人群的历史遗迹而闻名于世。地质学上的第三纪时期，这块地区边沿的三座火山开始频繁爆发，逐渐形成这里独特的地貌。由于与月球表面类似，这里也被称为“地球上最像月球的地方”。 我是四年前去的这里，由于一直连续旅行和工作拖延症晚期，当时拍的照片就扔在移动盘里几乎没再摸过。直到今天看到几个摄影活动，比如“多彩”、“飞行物”、“巨大的影子”、“简洁风”，这些关键词让我突然想起这次难忘的热气球飞行。所以我整理了一下照片，因为太多，会分两次发出来。这次就先一起来看看飞行的前半部分吧~ :) ##I had to get up at 5am in the cold morning, but it was definitely an out of the world experience that I would never forget. The balloon was gently drifting over the fantastic landscapes, when the orange hued rays of sunrise kissed the fairy chimneys, orchards, vineyards, pigeon houses and cone-shaped rock formations. It was a marvel with dreamlike serenity. ##虽然早上五点就得挣扎着起床，还冻个半死，但相比这场非凡的奇幻体验真的很值得！ 热气球载着我和其他几个乘客在空中缓缓飞行。朝阳渐渐滑出地平线，柔和橙黄的光芒给奇异的地貌镀上一层梦幻的暖色调。 在这清晨的静谧之中， 神仙烟窗，圆锥形石柱、蘑菇状奇石，白鸽岩屋等大自然鬼斧神工下的超现实奇景，不紧不慢地在眼前徐徐伸展开来。 ##Preparing for the flight:准备升空：.JPG) ##The beautiful and powerful burner:强劲酷炫的燃烧器：.jpg) ##Here are some other balloons and the otherworldly views I shot from my big basket. It’s not easy to describe that incredible surreal feeling. Come to experience it by yourself! =) 下面是我从自己乘坐的热气球篮子里拍到的高处和脚下的各种幻境。语言很难确切地形容当时美妙的感觉请原谅我词穷，总之，需要你们自己来体会！ :D .JPG) .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) ##So that’s it for the first half of my hot air balloon trip, stay tuned for the next half! :) 好啦，上半程的飞行之旅先到这里，下次继续奉上后半部分。你去过卡帕多奇亚吗？觉得这趟热气球旅行怎么样？如果没有去过，我真心向你安利这片神奇的土地和这个飞行项目，虽然现在越来越有名，越来越商业化。但是，相信我，你绝对不会后悔这个选择的，真的是超级独特的经历！我不是托儿 ;) All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多Photos shot by Canon Kiss X3 &amp; iPhone 4 Thank you for reading.

You can find the introduction about this place and my ride here. I described the incredible fantastic feeling in my last post, and now towards the end of the journey, our balloon is getting lower and lower, ready for landing. At the same time, there are more and more hot air balloons appearing in the sky. 接着上半段的土耳其卡帕多奇亚热气球之旅，我们再一起来看看后半部分的空中旅途。在上一篇里，我介绍了这块神奇地貌的形成，描述了飞行的美妙感受。现在这后半段里，热气球的高度渐渐下降，为着陆做准备。在靠近地面的空中也突然出现越来越多其他色彩图案各异的热气球。 ##First a throwback: 先来回忆下前半段飞行途中瞭望到的景色吧： .jpg) ##This is my blue balloon, though I took most pictures of that more photogenic rainbowish neighbor: ;) 下面照片里是我乘坐的蓝色热气球。然鹅，在我照片里出镜率最高的还是一直在我们旁边飞着的彩虹色热气球。你问我为什么？除了它五颜六色的更加上相之外，主要是因为我拍不到自己热气球的全身呗~： ##Since I wasn’t be able to shoot the whole image of my balloon, here’s part of the basket, and its complete shadow: 所以，只能近距离俯瞰一下载着我的大篮子的一边，还有全身投下的迷人的影子：.jpg) .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) ##Landed… I was still alive - so excited! :D 成功着陆啦！捏了几下自己的胳膊，还有知觉地存活着，好开心~！ .jpg) ##After landing, the balloon was packed, and we were offered champagne and other drinks. It felt great to celebrate together and warm up after the long flight in the cold morning. Each passenger was also awarded a flight certificate, woohoo~ I know, this is probably the easiest certificate you can get in your life - you only need to stand in a small moving basket for about 1 hour. And there you go - you did a historical flight over a moon-like landscape! ;) 落地后，大气球被打包。飞行员发给我们每人一杯香槟，还颁发了飞行证书。一篮子乘客聚在一起举杯欢庆这一幸存福的时刻~ =) 这可能是最容易得到的证书了吧 – 只需要呆站在一个在空中缓缓移动的篮子里，大约一小时后，飞行证书就到手了！还是如此奇幻地飞过地球上最像月球的地貌，简直酷毙了有木有？ .jpg) All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多Photos shot by Canon Kiss X3 &amp; iPhone 4 Thank you for reading.

C. | by @itchyfeetdonicaDonica多 | 摄于美国华盛顿 – 越南退伍军人纪念墙 According to an Asian proverb, “There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people’s eyes”. The same goes with Vietnam War, a war that has made a huge impact in countries like Vietnam and USA. In this post I’m going to show you some photos I took when I visited the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D. C. of US and the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City of Vietnam. I was neither in the War nor from any of the 2 countries, so I don’t feel like commenting on it with my limited knowledge and experience. What I want to do here is just displaying the different scenes I witnessed from 2 corners of the world. Feel free to tell me what you think about the photos, about the war, or about anything popping up to your mind. 总在路上，难免会被问到旅行的意义，所以我也偶尔思考这个问题樂，上帝啊请你别发笑。 陈绮贞唱的看过许多美景、看过许多美女也不错。你说这是装逼？对呀，谁会虚伪否认装逼也是旅行的意义之一？但这不是目的只是途径而已。举个栗子‍：在智利工作时先后遇到过两个保加利亚姑娘，一听说我去过她们那游客不太多的祖国，甚至她们那鸟不拉屎的家乡时，都是二话不说，立马加我为好友。另外一个阿尔巴尼亚姑娘也是这么落入了我好友的圈套，而我都没有主动把妹 别误会，我其实是直的啦，虽然觉得弯的也没什么不好️‍ (你看，这又是旅行的意义之一，让你敞开心胸接纳各种不同的观念和行为)。 当然，靠旅行经验来把妹/撩汉只是旅行很小的一部分意义，今天要聊的是更加深刻的意义（摆出严肃脸  害怕hold不住）。扯了半天，其实就是给我要写的“城事影像”活动征文铺垫（ 广告时间：这个活动很有文化内涵，主办人@aaronli最近又被黑账户被盗资产，所以大家都来支持一下吧~ 比如参加活动让他惊喜，得到奖金后再捐还给他让他双重惊喜……）。这期的主题是“黑暗”，这…… 似乎有悖于我一贯拥抱的欢快主旋律啊~。 但是，勇敢的我没有畏缩。有个词叫“见多识广”不是吗？这在当今各国主流媒体/价值观盛行的情况下，还真让广泛的旅行显得有那么些意义了。至少可以看到同一事件的不同侧面，有比较才有鉴别。扩展到日常，生活也多了很多其他选择，这点例子太多，以后再扯。=) ## 所以，今天我打算通过自己的有限经历和照片，来从两个不同侧面呈现越南战争这一“黑暗”时期的一小部分。当然，我既没有参加越战，又不是生活在主要参战方所在国，只是去了越南和美国，看了看两个越战纪念馆/碑而已，难免片面。这两地分别是美国首都华盛顿的越南退伍军人纪念碑，和越南胡志明市的战争遗迹博物馆。1975年4月，越南共和国首都西贡（如今的胡志明市）沦陷，越南统一，这场旷日持久的战争终于结束。##关于这场战争，维基百科的中文版是这样说的：&gt;越南战争（1955年－1975年），简称越戰，又称第二次印度支那战争，其本质为受美国等反共主義阵营国家支持的南越（越南共和国）對抗受苏联等共產主義国家支持的北越（越南民主共和国）和“越南南方民族解放陣線”（又稱越共）的一場战争。其发生在冷战时期的越南（主战场）、老挝、柬埔寨，是二戰以後美國參戰人數最多、影響最为深远的戰爭，最终美国在越南战争中遭受严重损失，综合国力随之削弱，冷战的优势逐渐为苏联占据。##历史是个有趣的东西，其本质似乎是客观的，但曾客观存在的人都已作古，只能任由后人评说。正经的评说一般要结合史料记载和考古发现之类的。而载入史册的资料就是绝对客观的吗？類 有人说历史是由胜利的一方书写的。就连每次看百度百科和维基百科，反映的历史都是不同的，更别说各国编写的历史教科书这个任娘打扮的小姑娘了。除了广泛游历，这也是多学一/几门语言的好处，看世界看人生 – “啪啪啪”，一下多打开了好几扇窗~比如，我们熟悉的抗日战争（War of Resistance Against Japan），在国际上是被称作第二次中日战争（Second Sino-Japanese War）的。就像下面要出现的越南战争的名称，在越南是叫抵美救国抗战（Resistance War Against America，可惜我不懂越南语，只能放个英文名称以便比较），而在国际上是越战（Vietnam War）或者第二次印度支那战争 （Second Indochina War）。历史经由不同个体呈现的表象是复杂的，不易辨别。建立这两个战争纪念馆/碑的两国人也是站在不同的主观立场上。一千个人眼中有一千个越南战争。我这个局外人更加不明就里，只能通过这些展出的片段看到一些拼凑的表象，所以我不想妄加评论。然而，战争的黑暗给了我们黑色的眼睛，我们却可以用它来寻找光明天啊~好深刻。有一点可以肯定的是，战争是无比残酷和黑暗的，不管哪个国家的平民都是渴望和平和光明的。*Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall | Washington D. C., USA越南退伍军人纪念墙 | 美国华盛顿先来看看美国首都华盛顿的越南退伍军人纪念墙。这面墙由華裔建筑师林璎设计，主要部份于1982年完工，是纪念碑的三个部分之一，用来纪念在越南战争中服役的美国士兵。虽然是著名建筑师林徽因的侄女，虽然设计了这一感染力强烈、一反惯常英雄纪念碑的独特V字形纪念墙，林璎的亚裔身份在当时却使得她的作品饱受严格的审查和争议。我去的时候碰上几个学校的师生来这个爱国教育基地参观，很多学生在老师的带领下献上鲜花、自己写的信、画的画等来缅怀曾在他乡逝去的同胞先烈。估计是因为美国的爱国教育，“自由”、“自由斗士”是他们很喜欢用的一/两个字眼，尤其是涉世不深的学生。下面的照片里就出现了好几次。无辜的平民士兵在战争中失去生命很令人痛惜，而他们在为“自由平等”而战的同时，越南的国民也是大量伤亡。对比后面胡志明市的战争遗迹博物馆里展出的几枚炮弹，对着墙上的美国独立宣言和死伤民众照片，让人深思。.JPG) .JPG) .JPG) War Remnants Museum | Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam越南战争遗迹博物馆 | 越南胡志明市 而在这一黑暗战争的发生地 – 越南，战争遗迹博物馆里呈现的又是另外一番景象。花了一下午，看完几层楼的室内陈列和露天展览，很沉重，很难过，想哭却又哭不出来，一种刺痛淤积在胸口，持续了好久。 展馆室外的美军飞机等装备武器： ##关于战争与和平的海报和书籍：Posters and books about war &amp; peace: 各地区的声援海报和宣传： ##橙剂是一种高效落叶除草剂，越战期间美军用飞机大规模喷洒于南方越共游击队藏身的林木植被。这种除草剂中含有毒性极强的二恶英化合物，在自然和人体中要耗费9到14年才能消解。这些化合物残留导致各种病变，同时破坏生育和遗传基因，造成越南超过百万的残疾儿童。越战中曾在南方服役军人的子女出生缺陷率高达30%。 我当时在展馆看到众多受橙剂污染致畸的儿童照片，触目惊心，不忍拍照，只拍了下面这张受害者参加国际会议，还有一位当年23岁的越南二代受害者写给美国总统奥巴马的信。战争的黑暗不仅造成当时巨大的伤亡，还给接下来的几代人带来如此可怕的身体上的摧残和心理上的阴影。 2 famous photos from the Vietnam War:两张出自越战的比较有名的摄影作品 – 暗无天日的战争岁月中苦苦挣扎的平民们： ##Robert Capa，这个二十世纪著名的战地摄影记者，葬身于越战前线的地雷： ##虽然我没有像这个法国人一样参加过越战，但在越南各地游历一番后，却对他说的话有些共鸣，这是一块很特别的土地。 ## ##下面几张在露天展览拍到的照片反映了富国战俘监狱里的种种酷刑。建于法国殖民时期的富国岛上的这个监狱是南越政权关押北越和越共囚犯的地方。 All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多Photos shot by Canon Kiss X3 &amp; iPhone 7 Thank you for reading.

It is particularly popular in mainland China during the Communist era when cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union were strong. @aaronli主办的A City a Story活动本周的主题是“宁静”，这让我想起那次泛舟宁静的莫斯科河。这也是我穿越西伯利亚之旅的第一站莫斯科游览的一部分。因为这次足球世界杯举办地的缘故，上个月我开始了“西伯利亚之旅”的连载 刚翻了一下，上一篇发表还是世界杯刚开始的时候，哈哈…… 先奉上一首宁静舒缓的俄罗斯老歌 – 我和@winniex合唱的《莫斯科郊外的晚上》（点击题图在@dsound收听或从文末的IPFS直接播放）。 ##The song was originally created as “Leningrad Nights” in 1955, but transliterated loosely as “Evenings in Moscow Oblast” at the request of the Soviet Ministry of Culture. In 1957, the song won prizes in both the international song contest and in Moscow. After that, it spread around the world. The song was introduced to China, also to the American mainstream audience during the Cold War era. Its covered versions peaked on the UK Singles Chart and the U.S. charts at the height of the folk revival. 这首歌是墙内开花墙外香的典型。原歌其实叫《列宁格勒的晚上》，创作于1955年，在苏维埃文化部的要求下，被大致翻译为《莫斯科的晚上》。1957年，这首歌在国际歌曲比赛和莫斯科的青年学生节上都斩获大奖。接着，在50年代亲苏联老大哥的中国大陆迅速传播开来。后来也逐渐被介绍到冷战时期和苏联关系僵化的美国。一些英美乐队翻唱的版本在60年代的爵士、民歌等音乐榜单上曾居高不下。 ##This song was adapted by the German band The Scorpions in 2000, and by the Chinese composer Gao Ping in 2003 for the Vocalizing Pianist, “Evenings in Suburban Moscow.” The famous Russian singer Vitas also recorded a version with his counter-tenor voice. I could recall his stunning performance at several Chinese music festivals. The lyrics of this song were shown in Cyrillic script, as the vanity card in 2 episodes of The Big Bang Theory in 2017 and 2018. 德国著名的蝎子乐队和中国作曲家高平也分别在2000年和2003年的时候改编过这首歌。还有一位在中国内地家喻户晓的俄罗斯歌手维塔斯，我记得他曾在几个中国的音乐节上用那出名的魅惑高音飙过一个版本。神奇的是，在爆笑美剧《生活大爆炸》最近两年的剧集里，最后的感言卡上竟然也出现了两次这首歌的俄文歌词。 ##Due to China’s connection with former Soviet Union, my uncles’ generation learnt Russian language for a few years at school. I still remember some words he taught me. I wish I knew Russian language more than a few survival phrases I learnt during the trans-Siberian trip, so I can check out the original lyrics. But since that won’t happen in recent years, here are the English lyrics for your reference: =) 因为当时和苏联的亲近关系，比我父母年长一些的那一代人很多都学过一点俄文。我到现在还记得几个大舅教过我的俄语单词，可惜我的俄语水平仅限于10个左右的单字和词组，还大都是在西伯利亚之旅中临时抱佛脚学的，带着打死也发不出大颤音的悲催~。虽然我很好奇这首歌的俄语究竟在唱些什么，但还是放个能看懂的英文版的歌词算了（中文版的大家估计都很熟就不贴啦）： ## Moscow Nights – English Lyrics Stillness in the grove, not a rustling soundSoftly shines the moon clear and bright.Dear, if you could know how I treasure soThe most beautiful Moscow night.Dear, if you could know how I treasure soThe most beautiful Moscow night. Lazily the brook, like a silvery streamRipples gently in the moonlight,And a song afar fades as in a dream,In the spell of this summer night. Dearest, why so sad, why the downcast eyes,And your lovely head bent so low?Oh, It’s hard to speak—and yet not to speakOf the longing my heart does know. Promise me, my love, as the dawn appearsAnd the darkness turns into light,That you’ll cherish, dear, through the passing yearsThis most beautiful Moscow night. .JPG) Now following my first post of the trans-Siberian journey, here’s the boat tour I did with my local hosts on the Moscow River. It was a lovely trip filled with fun! 介绍完《莫斯科郊外的晚上》，现在开始泛舟宁静莫斯科河的旅程~ ##First, let’s check out a picture I took of the route plan. You can see clearly the landmarks along the river, most of which were also captured in my following photos. :) 下面拍的图里有坐船的路线，那些著名建筑和雕塑的名称位置都有标注，我就不一一赘述了好会偷懒 旅行tip no.1 - 见到线路图一定要拍下来。 .JPG) I bought a can of the popular drink across Russia, Kbac(Kvass) - a traditional Slavic and Baltic beverage commonly made from rye/black bread in a process similar to beer making, with very low alcohol content (0.05 - 1.44%). The first time I tried it was in Harbin, northeast China - a city influenced by Russian culture: 我买了罐克瓦斯在船上喝，在俄罗斯的日子里几乎天天喝这个，东欧和波罗的海沿岸国家也很常见，是由裸麦面包发酵制成的，过程和酿造啤酒类似，酒精含量却超低 - 只有0.05 - 1.44%，几乎没有，在这个伏特加之国，对我这种酒量很差的人来说真是个救星。第一次喝是多年前在哈尔滨街头，这座中国东北的名城受到俄国文化影响不小。当时就觉得甜丝丝的味道不错，而且隐约感到比一般的水和果汁更解渴一点儿，所以也算夏季福音吧： .JPG) .jpg) ##My host’s friends checking out the photos taken for them by a photographer in the boat:同行的一对当地朋友在浏览船上摄影师给他们拍的照片：.JPG) Having fun with friends on this beautiful summer day:开心地和朋友一起享受着宁静美好的夏日时光：.JPG) ##Some landmarks:一些沿岸的地标： .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) Remember this place from the photo above? It was where I shot those dancing scenes by the river. That’s another day in Moscow at the golden hour. You can find them here - my first post of the trans-Siberian journey. 还记得上面这张照片里的河滨步道吗？这是我拍摄黄昏时分当地人在莫斯科河边起舞的地方，如果感兴趣，可以看看我的上一篇贴文。 ##So that’s it for today’s boat tour, hope you enjoyed the song and the views!

It is the capital city of the Basque Autonomous Community in northern Spain. 各位周末好~ 在这几篇帖子里，请跟我一起来看看西班牙巴斯克自治区的首府 – 维多利亚市的几处街头景象。对，巴斯克就是北边老是闹独立的那块地方~ Like many non-European tourists, except for those famous Spanish destinations like Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Granada and some islands, I only knew Bilbao and San Sebastián in this part of Spain. I never heard of Vitoria Gasteiz until my road trip to northern Spain, and it turned out to be a huge gem. It was awarded the title of European Green Capital in 2012 and it is consistently ranked as one of the 5 best places to live in Spain. 维多利亚市在国际游客当中没什么名气，却连年被评为西班牙最适合居住的五大城市，还是2012年的“欧洲绿色之都”。我去西班牙北部之前也根本没听过这个地方，除了全国那些个耳熟能详的大城市，北部我也只知道美食之都圣塞巴斯蒂安和古根海姆博物馆所在地毕尔巴鄂。这次去了才发现，这维多利亚原来还真是块宝地呢。这篇先发几张街头摄影，后续会更详细地介绍这座城市。 ## ## I witnessed these kids playing on the iron bench with the poor statue, and captured the scene with my camera. I found it pretty amusing - the statue’s serious face versus the kids’ having fun. =) You can’t expect naughty children to behave like adults - sitting next to the statue on the bench. Are they being creative by sitting on his shoulder or are they just damaging public properties? What do you think? :) ## 我很喜欢抓拍街头的小孩子，因为儿童一般比较活泼，会呈现很多生动有趣的瞬间。我从这条街走过时，看到这尊可怜的雕像被几个小孩轮番折磨，他那紧锁眉头却又无可奈何的样子和孩子们的开心快活形成有意思的对比，让人忍俊不禁。不知道我是该夸奖他们坐得高看得远的创意、不走寻常路的思维，还是应该声讨他们破坏公共财物的无礼行为呢？你怎么看？欢迎留言分享喔！ Here are some more street shots from the same city:下面还有几张这个城市的街头随拍： Happiness is simple.

The painting spreads over the whole wall and blends perfectly with the windows, the flower pots and the electrical cabinet in front. I also like how the artist handled the details of the fabric. You see all the creases and even the letters on the small tag. It must have cost a lot of time and it required great skills to create this piece of artwork. In fact, I never heard of this capital city of the Basque country before, but it turned out to be a huge gem. It was awarded the title of European Green Capital in 2012 and it is consistently ranked as one of the 5 best places to live in Spain. Wandering through the city, I was amazed by this multicultural place with a wide variety of architectures and the stunning street art in many corners of the city. ##大家好，接着上篇贴文，我继续带你们来看西班牙北部巴斯克地区首府的街头。以前并没有听说过维多利亚这座城市，来了才发现原来这座欧洲的绿色之都充满惊喜，街头处处是风格各异的建筑，鳞次栉比，和谐共存。遍布街巷的那些栩栩如生的壁画涂鸦也很让人惊叹。 题图里这副壁画有着逼真的细节，连布料的褶皱阴影和标签上的小字都看得一清二楚。整幅画的颜色也和几扇窗户、窗台上的鲜花、还有前面的电控箱无缝对接。这么一幅巨作该是花费了不少时间和精力才得以完工，也需要娴熟的绘画技巧，来之不易。 ## .jpg) The same wall and the other one nearby: ##.JPG) ## The statue you see here is Celedón, a traditional character who kicks off the festivities in honor of the White Virgin from August 4th to 9th each year. The “Bajada de Celedón” was created in 1957 by a group of young people from the city of Vitoria Gasteiz. The figure descends from the tower of the San Miguel Church to a balcony in the Virgen Blanca Square. From there, he comes out as a human in order to go through the crowds up to the “balconada”(a row of balconies), where he invites everyone to join the fun festivities. Later at night of August 9th, Celedón returns to the tower of the church. He waves farewell to the public and will come back in the following year. ## ##More of my posts about street art:跟街头涂鸦有关的旧帖： Street Art &amp; Ghost Festival in Malacca 马六甲街头壁画和鬼节 Caminito in Buenos Aires, Argentina 阿根廷首都的卡米尼托区 Street Art &amp; Sultan Mosque in Singapore 新加坡的街头涂鸦和苏丹清真寺 Comuna 13 of Medellín, Colombia 哥伦比亚毒枭老巢的贫民窟 Colorful Olinda, Brazil 巴西的多彩海滨小镇奥林达 ##Previous posts about Northern Spain:更多西班牙北部的帖子： Framed Playa de la Concha in San Sebastián 贝壳湾 Bird Nests near Burgos 鸟巢们 All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多Photos shot by Canon Kiss X3 Thank you for reading.

The picture was clicked from the grand canal, with a view of the Cathedral of Santa Maria della Salute. The canal area was full of life with constant hustle and bustle. But all these turned into a peaceful scene when the setting sun started to cast a warm spell over everything. I loved watching all the boats and gondolas swaying in the water, passing by those wonderful architectures at the shore. In the colored photo, you can see the orange-hued domes and buildings, against the pinkish sky and by the blueish water; while in the monochrome one, the structure and lines of the buildings &amp; boats, as well as the contrast of the shades &amp; shapes are more prominent.

Marinate seabass fillet for 10 to 15 minutes with salt, rice wine, corn flour and white pepper; 混合玉米淀粉、白胡椒粉、盐和料酒，将鱼片腌制10到15分钟； .JPG) (2). Heat a wok over a high flame to fry the cut garlic, ginger and chilli in cooking oil; 切好的蒜、姜和干辣椒入油锅煎一会儿； (3). Add the pickled cabbage later and stir fry them; 加入含有泡椒的酸菜，拌炒一分钟； (4). Pour the fish stock or hot water into the wok, bring to a boil. Add the fish and boil for another 2 minutes; 加热水或高汤煮开，然后加入鱼片煮两分钟左右； (5). Pour everything into a deep bowl, and garnish with sesame and chives. Enjoy!  最后，把酸菜和鱼片倒入大碗内，撒些白芝麻和青葱。开吃吧！ .JPG) ##That’s it! Isn’t it easy to make?

Irwin and his wife Terri achieved worldwide fame by hosting the internationally broadcast wildlife documentary series – The Crocodile Hunter (1996–2007). I watched a few episodes and found him fun and adventurous. And his passion in protecting wildlife is contagious. But sadly, he died in 2006 after being pierced in the heart by a stingray barb, and “Ocean’s Deadliest” was the underwater documentary he was filming. His parents founded the Australia Zoo in Beerwah, a town situated north of Glass House Mountains (I blogged about these amazing mountains here), pretty close to where I lived. So it’s made a great weekend visit from home. :) 下图中可以看到别称“鳄鱼猎人”的史蒂夫·欧文的照片。他父母在Beerwah这个小镇建起了澳洲动物园，就在玻璃屋土著群山的北边，离我澳洲的住处不远，所以找了个周末去一探究竟。 ##Inside the zoo, there were plenty of photos and other materials displayed, telling their adventure stories and efforts in wildlife conservation. I’d love to show you some in my coming posts. Though Steve’s son Robert Irwin is pretty young, he is a great photographer. I was impressed by his awesome photo works in the exhibition room, and this calendar is standing on my desk right now: There’s a lot to see and to do in this zoo, such as watching the shows of feeding giant tortoises and otters, patting koalas… and of course, the most famous attraction is the Wildlife Warriors Show! I surely got my adrenaline pumping as I watched a massive croc launching a strike from the water’s edge. But let’s start from some milder ones first: 动物园里有很多动物我这是废话吗，而最有名气的看点要数“鳄鱼捕食秀”，场面非常紧张刺激，看得我肾上腺素狂飙。我想想这第一帖还是从比较温和的袋鼠们开始吧，以后再说凶残的鳄鱼~ .JPG) ##Wallabies and kangaroos are similar marsupials that belong to the same family, but wallabies are generally smaller than kangaroos with shorter legs and a more varied color pattern. ##我们先来看看小袋鼠。这里的“小”不是我一时兴起瞎加上的，而是它的名字真的叫“小袋鼠”，英文是“wallaby”，跟袋鼠“kangaroo”同属于哺乳纲的有袋类动物，但体型一般比（大）袋鼠小很多，毛色也更丰富。 I once wrote about one wild wallaby standing in the middle of the road in a forest: 曾经有一篇写到过一只站在大森林里的马路中间张望的小袋鼠： ##A wallaby lost in thought:陷入沉思的小袋鼠： .jpg) .jpg) Now it’s Eastern Grey Roo’s turn.接下来出场的是昆士兰州常见的东部灰袋鼠，我经常会在上下班路上偶遇几只。 Kangaroo mama and joe are both getting fed:妈妈和宝宝都在吃~ .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) ##Here’s something I found a bit weird (or creative?

I invite you to follow me today to watch the sunrise at Angkor Wat. It’s inspired by A City a Story photo contest hosted by @aaronli. As a national symbol of Cambodia,  Angkor Wat is the country’s prime attraction that draws a large number of visitors all year round. And watching sunrise over the towers is a must when visiting this place. This temple complex is the largest religious monument in the world, built by a Khmer King as a Hindu temple of god Vishnu in the early 12th century, gradually transforming into a Buddhist temple towards the end of the same century. ##各位可能都听过柬埔寨的吴哥窟吧？作为国家的象征，吴哥窟实在是太有名了，连柬埔寨国旗上都印着它的图案。每年自然吸引了无数游客前来观光。而来到这里，起早观日出也是必不可少的项目既然不可少，就意味着汹涌的人潮。 这一寺庙建筑群是世界上最大的宗教纪念性建筑，公元十二世纪早期由一位高棉国王下令建造，起初是想建成印度教主神毗瑟挐的印度庙，结果到了世纪晚期逐渐变成了佛教寺庙。 .JPG) ##We got up at 4am in Siem Reap that day and arrived at the Angkor Wat site by e-bike (faster and cooler than the tuk tuk) at around 5:10am, when it’s already packed with visitors. After walking through the causeway, the waiting game started by the reflection pond in front of the main temple. There were people waiting in different spots, and I picked this spot with less heads in front. ##我们那天四点就起床了，洗漱后就骑着电动摩托车️风驰电掣般往吴哥窟狂奔（大部分游人是坐三轮车去的，当然也有土豪包车去）。一路上耳边风声呼呼，超越三轮车四轮车无数，等五点十分抵达停车处，已然是人山人海。停好车顺着水上长堤和人流走一截，再过西门继续走，最后来到吴哥窟前方的两个池塘中间，找了个前面人头较少的一块湿地落下脚，饥困交迫地开始了等待。 Still dark when we arrived:刚到时晨光熹微:.JPG) ##This is what I mean by “less heads in front”:这已经算我说的”前面人头较少”的好地方了:.JPG) ##Because the crowds is like this:因为你看看这黑压压一片的观日出大军就明白了右下角那位仁兄貌似已经开始在拍小昆虫练手了：.jpg) ##All the crowds were waiting for that exciting moment in silence. The sun finally appeared over the horizon at 6:10am, shining through the trees and spangling the water surface. The flickering ripples in the pond started to dance with the golden sun rays… then the yellow sphere quickly glided up the trees, in a few minutes, the whole sky was lit up. ☀️ ##四周一片寂静，所有人都在等待那神圣一刻的到来。六点十分的时候，金黄色的圆球开始跃升出地平线，透过树影，点亮水面，池塘潋滟的波纹在柔和的光线下跃动起舞…… ☀️这轮发光体很快滑上树梢，挂在空中。整个过程短短几分钟，接着气温陡然上升，困倦的双眼被这万丈光芒刺得无法睁开，一颗小心却久久不能平静，起个大早经历等待后终于看到了这朝思暮想的一刻。 .JPG) .jpg) ##Pretty stunning right? As a night person, I can’t get up early, so I take much more sunset shots than sunrise ones. But I once read that at sunset the sky is full of pollutants and wind-borne particles, while more colors can be perceived at dawn than at dusk. What do you think of this? 这日出是不是挺美的？身为夜猫子，我拍过很多日落，却很少拍到日出。但是看到书上说傍晚日落时的天空有不少细小的污染颗粒和风载尘埃，而日出时天空更纯净，色彩更缤纷。你们有这感觉吗？ After the sunrise, we went on to visit the temples nearby, in the extreme heat and humidity:看完日出，我们就顶着烈日，边被极度湿热吞噬着，边走去旁边逛庙: .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) Since my topic today is about the sunrise, I’m not going to extend too much on the temples, only a few tips first: You can visit Angkor Wat as well as other religious sites such as Angkor Thom, Bayon, Preah Khan, Banteay Srei, Pre Rup, Ta Prohm, Terrace of the Elephants…, in an extensive jungle area a bit north of Siem Reap, a base for exploring those amazing ancient temples and surrounds. 7-day pass is a good choice since there’s quite some distance between certain sites, and there’s so much to see at each site. If you are short of time, you can also choose the 3-day pass. Remember to bring sunscreen and cool clothes for the heat, and cover your shoulders and knees as required by the religious culture. ##因为我今天的话题是日出，所以就不多聊庙的话题了，先来简单的几点提醒: =) 除了吴哥窟，暹粒北边这一片丛林里的古迹还有吴哥城、巴戎寺、宝剑塔、女王宫、变身塔、塔普伦寺、斗象台等。 有些遗址间相距较远，而每个遗址又有很多细节可以看，所以建议购买七日票，去慢慢看个够，如果时间紧张也可以买三日票，而一日票就太赶了，走马观花也看不到什么。 记得要带防晒霜和凉快透气的衣服，丛林常有的高温高湿和强紫外线实在是伤不起啊。出于对当地宗教文化的尊重，进寺庙等宗教建筑的时候，上衣最好遮住肩膀，下身长及膝盖。 All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多Photos shot with Canon EOS Kiss X3 &amp; iPhone 7 Thank you for reading.

Pretty often we underestimate the power of a smile, the gorgeous curve that sets everything straight. Have you ever had the experience that someone’s lovely smile just brightens your day? It happened to me a lot in daily life and during my travels. ##这两张照片是在柬埔寨首都金边的一座寺庙拍的。我正打算进入寺庙参观，就看见这对小姐妹朝我跑过来，还挥着小手打招呼，脸上挂着可爱的笑。我指着相机，问可不可以给她们拍几张照片，她们很开心地配合。拍完给她们看了照片，她们又快活地笑起来。可惜语言不通，看她们的比划，意思可能是她们家就住在这庙附近。 以前在好几篇帖子里都发过旅途中捕捉到的笑脸，比如：一些旅途中的微笑。世界各地常常会遇上语言不同，但是微笑却永远相通。不管是出门在外的路途中，还是日常生活的琐碎里，这些发自内心的快乐总是让人受到感染，让日复一日上演的无聊剧目变得生动起来。 ##To show you a bigger picture of the environment, also to prove this is my photo work as required by the hostess, here’s another photo of the same sisters: ##And a photo of 4 boys having fun in front of a market in the same city - Phnom Penh:下面这张也是在金边，四个小男孩在大市场门口全神贯注地玩手机： Photographing a Family | San Juan, Puerto Rico螳螂捕蝉 黄雀在后 | 波多黎各 圣胡安 At La Recoleta Cemetery | Buenos Aires, Argentina 瑞科莱塔公墓一角 | 阿根廷 布宜诺斯艾利斯 ## ##Some posts I did before about people on streets:我之前发过的一些街头摄影： Streets of the Basque Capital (1) 巴斯克首府街头（一） Street Art &amp; Ghost Festival in Malacca 马六甲街头壁画和鬼节 Kids &amp; Mangoes &amp; Life 孩子和芒果(的哲思 ;p) Comuna 13 of Medellín, Colombia 哥伦比亚毒枭老巢的贫民窟 The Busker and His Soulmate 街头知音 By the Scheldt River of Antwerp(1) 失望的小女孩 A Syrian Girl Feeding a Cat 喂猫的叙利亚女孩 All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多Photos shot with Canon EOS Kiss X3 &amp; iPhone 7 Thank you for reading.

That afternoon, I walked past a bakery, and the people inside waved hello to me. So I stopped at their window to have a chat with them in my crappy Spanish. Despite the economic condition in Cuba, they are pretty happy and carefree. We managed to talk a bit and laughed a lot. The rationing system of food distribution in Cuba reminds me of the same situation in the Communist China decades ago. I heard the stories from my parents and grandparents. Like the Cubans, Chinese people at that time had to take a coupon booklet to a ration shop, to get their family minimums for supplies like rice, oil, salt, sugar… and the frequency of basic goods is also defined by the government. Before I left, they asked me to take a photo for them. Enjoy their contagious smiles! =) ##To show you their working environment, also to prove this is my photo work as required by the hostess, here’s another photo of the same lady: ##As I said in a previous post about Some SMILE Portraits in My Travels : A smile costs nothing, but gives much.

It happened to me a lot in daily life and during my travels. And a flashback of a scene I captured on another street in Old Havana, a lively and hectic district full of local charm. The doors of local homes are usually wide open, and portrait of Fidel Castro or Che Guevara is a common sight on the wall of many homes. The locals seem to enjoy sitting outside, chatting or playing music. ##这几张照片都拍于古巴的哈瓦那老城区。这块地区的居民大都是本地家庭，和不少拉美的老城区相似，虽然有些脏乱，却充满原始蓬勃的生机和活力。色彩明艳的街道建筑，喧闹拥挤的市集，浓烟滚滚的老爷车，奔跑嬉闹的孩童…… 没错，原汁原味的古巴风情就在这里。当地人家几乎都是大门敞开，在门口坐着聊天或吹拉弹唱，欢声笑语，好生快活。一条街走过去，很多户的墙上都挂着菲德尔 · 卡斯特罗或切 · 格瓦拉的肖像，就像凭粮票领日常供给的国营商店一样，这是一代人共同的记忆。 All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多Photos shot with Canon EOS Kiss X3 Thank you for reading.

I visited this interesting market near the village Turmi, and encountered this woman from Hamar/Hamer tribe, a semi-nomadic, pastoral community best known for their distinctive style and bull-leaping ceremony. They have elaborately rolled hair in red ochre and beef tallow, and are wearing beautiful beaded necklaces and metal bracelets. It’s said that they are fond of the accessories made of shells, which they trade at these markets brought over from Kenya. ##To prove this is my photo work as required by the hostess, here’s another photo of the same lady: ##And a picture I took of other 2 girls at the market: ##Here’s another Hamar woman I posted before, but in front of her home, not from the same market. The marital collar on her neck indicates that she is the first wife, just like the woman on the left from the photo above. And you can see from the head image - that woman is not a first wife without the special collar. I know, it sounds a bit crazy right? Like in many tribes, the men here can marry multiple women, as long as they have enough cows to pay the bride price. 大家好！今天分享的几张照片是在埃塞俄比亚南部Omo山谷地区拍的。当时我在Turmi村附近的一个传统露天市集闲逛，看到这些Hamar部落的姑娘。 Hamar是一个有着独特审美风格的半游牧部族，族里成年男人的跳牛仪式远近闻名。女人们的传统发型很特别，头发被搓成很多细小的发束，掺和进红土和牛油来染色加固。身上佩戴着颜色鲜艳的串珠项链和金属手镯。 据说族人很钟爱贝壳制成的饰品，因为埃塞俄比亚本国不产贝壳，物以稀为贵，他们不惜花高价从邻国肯尼亚进口，其实就是用他们认为值钱的东西去以物易物，在这样的土产市集上换取贝壳制品。 最后两张曾在不同的主题帖子里发过，但从穿戴打扮来看，这里的四个女人都是来自同一个部族。最后这一张里抱小孩的妈妈，还有上面一张左边的女人，都戴着独特的金属粗项圈，表明她们是第一任妻子。而题图里的女人戴着普通的金属项圈，应该是已婚但非首任妻子。第三张照片里右边的姑娘没有带项圈，所以应该还是未婚。 没错，这个原始部落的男人就是这么任性，想娶几个娶几个，只要拥有足够多头牛当聘礼…… All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多Photos shot with Canon EOS Kiss X3 Thank you for reading.

It’s kind of free writing to express my thoughts. But of course, it’s hard to escape my beloved elements of travel or photography. ;) 今天继续极简风的主题，抛弃通常的看图说话，来玩玩直抒胸臆。=) Less is more.Simplicity is king.Quality, not quantity.Collect moments, not things.Eliminate instead of organize. ##You might hear similar sayings hundreds of times? Same here. I was fond of minimalism in the aesthetic sense from the beginning, without knowing this term, such as architectures or patterns with simple lines and shapes, and paintings or photos with enough negative space… But the wider sense of minimalist style started to sink in, when I decided to quit my day job and sold my apartment while in mortgage. When I finally gave up everything I worked hard to have owned, but to study and work abroad and to travel the world, it came to me. It’s not that I wanted to follow any minimalism fad, it’s because when I traveled a lot, I simply couldn’t possess a lot. I had to discard all the unnecessary stuff to move around lightly. I started to realize it’s perfectly possible to live out of a suitcase or/and a backpack. When I was on the road for less than 3 months, a small backpack was always enough.  shot by me from Amtrak’s California Zephyr train | USA I guess frequent travelers or expats know it - you don’t need that much except for some essential items. Would you rather own the world and see a little, or own a little and see the world? When you own less, you see more; and when you feel more, you desire even less. Eventually, the magical hands of minimalism started to reach all parts of my life, reminding me constantly to ask myself the questions: “Do I really need this? ““Can I reuse that instead of replacing it?”  shot by me right after sunrise in the desert area | Bolivia So I consume less and less, but create more and more. Still, I’m not sure if I’m a 100% minimalist. Or does the word of “minimalism” really make that much sense? Though I adore the clean Nordic style, I also love the effusive flow of colors and details everywhere when living in Latin America. I value the serenity and solidarity in the empty wildness, with only basic necessities to survive; But at the same time, I enjoy the clashing of ideas with different minds, in a messy space filled with models and prototypes. I cherish a little simple sandwich in a quiet Western town, while I miss as well the endless choices of food, along with the hustle and bustle from Asian streets. ##Humans are never simple, aren’t we?  shot by me from a ship in Sydney | Australia ##At last, let me end with a few lines from The Minimalists blog I’ve been following for years: Minimalism is a tool that can assist you in finding freedom.Freedom from fear.Freedom from worry.Freedom from overwhelm.Freedom from guilt.Freedom from depression.Freedom from the trappings of the consumer culture we’ve built our lives around.Real freedom.

So I was browsing through news when I read the heated discussion of a Chinese family’s experience in a hostel in Stockholm. It reminds me of my own encounter with a lesbian girl there. At the airport in Stockholm, I met the same German girl whom I chatted with in the airport of Bangkok a few months ago. Small world, isn’t it? So I’m recalling some seemingly impossible reunions during my travels. The magic of traveling. 刚从阿尔卑斯的深山老林回来， 回归网络世界，恶补一下中文和时事，看到很多旅游媒体都在讨论曾先生和父母在斯德哥尔摩一家旅馆被瑞典警察强制带离的事件。 一时间各种舆论观点层出不穷，有声讨中国游客“撒泼”的，有搜索旅馆黑历史的，有质疑夸张被弃地点的，有力挺中国大使的，有比较瑞中法律和文化差异的。还有人甚至提到这几年瑞典极右势力的抬头，进而分析了整个欧洲所面临的严峻局势……  不得不感慨社交媒体的强大，也想起自己多年前在斯德哥尔摩一家旅馆的经历。虽说这些年蜻蜓点水地走过了欧洲所有的申根国，细数一下，瑞典还是我去背包游的第一个欧洲国家呢。当时，利用开学前的空闲，心血来潮地计划了个环波罗的海游，手握一张12欧的瑞安廉航机票，先从比利时飞到了斯德哥尔摩。 到达荒野里一片树林中的小机场后，我坐上开往市区的大巴。上车后，突然发现坐我后面的妹子有点眼熟，定睛一看，这不是几个月前在泰国曼谷机场排队值机时，站在我后面跟我聊过几句的德国姑娘吗？她也盯着我看，认真确认过眼神后，遇上的果然是同一个人。 这是怎样的猿粪？世界很大，相逢也巧。佛啊，你说前世五百次的回眸，换来今生的一次擦肩而过？那，我们这是回眸了一千次吗~ 不知今后是否还会在某个角落再次偶遇？ 晚上摸索到斯德哥尔摩的青年旅馆后，我放下小背包，刚洗漱完爬上床，一黑发黑衣黑裤的年轻女生走了进来。她哭红了眼圈，黑黑的眼线也花了，在我旁边的床上坐下，继续抽泣，肩膀在酷酷的黑衣下不住抖动。我问她出什么事了，她告诉我因为她喜欢另一个女生，不被父母接受，大吵一架，就住到这里来了。 原来如此，住过形形色色的青旅、民宿和酒店，遇到过那么多五湖四海的游人，这还是第一次碰上来自本地的住客。我这才注意到她头发是染黑的，根部是北欧人常见的浅金色，而当时的我头发染成了所谓的巧克力色，根部是亚洲人常见的黑色。 呵呵，人总是对自己所没有的很好奇，想着改变现状。 我问她以后打算怎么办，她说先在这里住着，如果父母一直不认可她的性倾向，她就不回去。到现在我还记得她哽咽着说的那句：“斯德哥尔摩这么大，可何处才是我们同性恋的家”。 其实朋友、同事中都有喜欢同性的，在比利时还有过两位女同邻居一起养着两个小孩，也见过中国男生跟比利时男生的结合。更多的是旅途中遇到的世界各地的LGBT（Lesbian女同, Gay男同, Bisexual双性恋, Transgender变性者），听过很多他们的故事，同情他们不被理解的遭遇。而在瑞典遇到这个来住当地青旅的姑娘，还是不禁有点惊讶。 因为一直以为北欧是相对来说对LGBT比较宽容的地区，瑞典是全世界第一个在法律上允许变性的国家，也早在40年代就已合法化同性恋关系。他们有名的LGBT游行Stockholm Pride从1998年到现在，每年8月举行，已经走了20年。在这里尚有这些家人反对的碰撞，可以想见世界其他地方的状况了。去年底在澳洲，才刚刚看到众议院通过同性婚姻合法化的法案，顷刻间，整个国家一片狂欢。 第二天，一位曾经跟我学中文的瑞典朋友领着我逛了下市区，也是当天才发现他就在斯京上班，上次见面还是在中国。上面提到了机场偶遇那枚德国妹纸，可能这也是旅行的魔力之一吧，让我一次又一次觉得世界是这么大，而同时也很小，常常以为今后不会再遇上的小伙伴，竟然在将来的某个时刻，在地球的另一角落，就这么毫无预兆地重逢。 还有几个类似的栗子‍，比如，我在从芬兰去爱沙尼亚的船上遇到个来自智利住苏格兰的小哥，也是酷爱环球旅行，研究人文地理的，聊得很投机。不想过了一周，又在拉脱维亚的首都里加的老城中再见。那天，我打开青旅房间的窗户，他正好从楼下的老街走过。这难道是演电影吗？！当时我也不曾想到，过了几年，我会去他的故国智利住上一年多，亲眼看到他描述的那些绝美的风景，从北部的阿塔卡马，一路走到南边的巴塔哥尼亚。 从塔林去里加的大巴上，坐我旁边的罗马尼亚小哥，在荷兰学土木，千里迢迢追来拉脱维亚挽回要分手的女友。 跟我神聊了一路，后来里加游玩结束，我们互相道别，以为人生旅途不会再交叉。结果回比利时没多久，周末在安特卫普北边的朋友家吃饭时，突然收到这小哥邀我去玩的短信。想想确实不远，于是，第二天我就毫无计划地跳上了去代尔夫特的火车。于是，又一次旅伴重逢。他还从苦逼的论文间隙抽空带我参观了个奶酪工厂，多让人感动的革命友谊~ 又过了一年，他骑摩托车环游欧洲时经过比利时，去大学城找我玩，我把地板借给他睡了一晚，还用一碗热汤解救他于冷风呼啸的夜途。 还有还有，冰岛首都接待我的巴西裔沙发主，过了几个月去伦敦出差，也顺道睡了晚我布鲁塞尔阁楼上的沙发。带他在附近闲逛时还发现家很好吃的巴西餐馆，于是，黑豆炖肉饭和烤肉一起吃到扶墙而出。 他送我一块硕大的巴西国旗图案的绿色纺织品，我就随手把它挂在窗户上遮阳。没想到短短几年后，我真的去了他心心念念的足球桑巴的故乡。然后，在里约热内卢有名的性感沙滩，我目睹了那些传说中热辣的巴西女郎。原来，她们把那种大国旗当作浴巾裹在自己玲珑的躯体上。 之前我有篇博文里还写过，和巴拿马同一旅馆的英国小哥碰巧都在下一站飞到哥伦比亚的春城麦德林，于是同游了据说有点危险的13区贫民窟。告别后也没有再联系，结果前几个月竟然在同一天傍晚来到澳洲墨尔本的同一片海滩，只是他是在猫本上班，而我是自驾途中的停留。突然想到小时候最爱看的节目《正大综艺》（你好，李秀媛~），里面的主持人每期都会说：“不看不知道，世界真奇妙。” 而这些旅途中的相遇和重逢，是不是也很奇妙？ ##刚又好奇查了下李秀媛的近况，看到篇不是很近的网易旅游专访（2012年的） – 对世界的好奇心永远不变，很有共鸣，来点节选： ## 《正大综艺》真的是一个史上的经典，正大发掘我，给我一个成长的空间，给我旅行的养分，我可以在世界各地这么多的地方进行比较。我看到富裕、贫困以及最底层的生活状态。我很庆幸的是，我属于比上不足、比下有余的情况。人要知道知足，只要有一口牛奶就可以活下来。我常常抱着很感恩的心。 比较起来20年的变化不能不大，自己在体能和心态上也不可能不变，但是我永远不变的，是对世界的好奇和想动的心。我现在两、三个月不出国腿脚就开始痒。 我是无心插柳，凭外貌、身高以及各方面的条件我是进不了这个行业的。我个子也不高，长得也很一般，也没有特殊的背景，很多时候还要有特殊的关系。我一直觉得，我从来没有想过当艺人这件事是我的梦想。我父母亲都是老师，他们觉得你学商业，嫁一个老公，相父教子呆着就很安分。我记得我17岁的时候瞒着爹娘，弹着吉它穿着格子衬衫去路边唱歌。我父母亲都是很严肃的人，我父亲是教务主任，突然有一天我唱完歌发现我父母在下面，他们没有责怪我，觉得爱唱歌不是一件坏事，但是不能耽误学业。 ##哈哈，都是容易满足的itchyfeet，同样严肃的教务主任父亲~ ## 我常常会看别人的节目，经常看欧洲、美洲，很自在的旅游达人到世界各地炒菜，或者他带着你自助旅行。但我并没有看重哪一个主持人。因为我不能太关注他，太关注他的话我一定会学习他，这是人性。你崇拜一个人的时候，你会不自觉的模仿他。其实人应该有一个自我的特质，做自己最好。喜欢我的观众朋友，觉得我容易亲近，一直像隔壁家经常旅行的姐姐。他们看顺眼了，并不看重你长得漂不漂亮，他觉得你是亲切的，可以接近的，这是我比较占优势的一点，我比较容易交朋友。 ## 我们以前是两个主持人，我和谢佳勋，她也非常优秀。我们两个人个性不同，她是长头发，我一辈子是短头发。大家觉得我是属于比较男孩的个性。她是属于斯文优雅的，所以早期都安排她去伦敦、巴黎这些优雅的地方，我就去亚马逊丛林、食人族或者小的部落。这些地方现在就算是百万富翁，亿万富翁也不见得能去到。记得我去巴布亚新几内亚，他们有一个成人礼，人到16岁的时候要在背上做一个记号。那里有一条河是巴布亚新几内亚的母亲河，他们有一个传说是说他们祖先掉到河里了，鳄鱼把他叼上来抚育长大，所以他们对鳄鱼非常的尊敬。成人礼上你要进一个房子，在里面用竹片给自己身上割的全是血，再用母亲河的泥巴在敷在上面结痂。因为里面有细菌会化脓，化脓以后久久不散，然后会变成一个一个包，像鳄鱼的皮一样。 ## 我觉得人生是很矛盾的，你必须有一个信仰，有信仰你就会很规范，你会敬天爱民，你知道这个土地对你有多少恩泽。你没有信仰的时候觉得天不怕地不怕，现在某些地方的人是没有信仰的，他们会觉得我无所谓，我过好当下就好了，他不会考虑别人的观感。但是你在那个环境里，你会觉得他们敬畏天神，他们觉得天神会保护他们。那样的精神我一直觉得很了不起，你现在让我在手上扎一针流血，我会晕倒。他们要在身上扎几十个包，从小对家里就要有传承，要有责任。我看到这些觉得是无知，但不会觉得他们是落后、粗鲁，我反而是敬佩他们的。 ## 我妈大概给我安排了20几次相亲，之前还有一段时间报纸、杂志猜我是不是同性恋…… 如果你放下工作是一个很大的牺牲，不放下对人家来讲就是很大的不公平。后来我觉得有些东西不能两全，你必须做一些取舍，这些取舍最好是对别人没有伤害，对自己也是觉得心安的，所以我很好心放那个男人走了。 ## 后来我看到报纸上有《世界真奇妙》的节目征外景主持人…… 当时我只是备取，不是正取，他们选了一个在美国念书的博士，可是因为她去西班牙斗牛的时候被小牛斗了一下，放弃了这样的人生，最后换成了我。我现在不吃牛肉，就是因为感谢那只牛把她撞走了。 配图都是我在瑞典斯德哥尔摩拍的照片，和同性恋女生的故事一起参加@aaronli的 “A City a Story” 征文。感兴趣的朋友也来投稿吧~ 珞 Thank you for reading.

But my main purpose today is to show you these lovely vehicles on my way to the peak and at the Edelweißspitze viewpoint. These old tractors were restored and painted bright colors. I guess their owners took very good care of them. Like me, quite a lot of people at the parking were taking photos of these shiny stars. ;) It must be a pretty amazing experience driving these tractors up and down the alpine road!  .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) There were also motorcyclists riding up the mountains.

It is a yearly show held in Ravels since 1988, and it has evolved from collections of old agricultural vehicles and machinery.

Have you ever tried driving this kind of vehicle? :) 大家好！今天分享的是我在阿尔卑斯山区看到的一些翻新的老式拖拉机。它们被漆成闪亮的绿、蓝、红等鲜艳的颜色，在阳光的照耀下熠熠生辉，十分抢眼。还有的车发动机也被改装，看上去很酷炫。我先是在开往奥地利最高峰 — 大钟山的高山公路上偶遇几位老年绅士，他们开着这些老爷车，往山下突突驰骋。是不是很拉轰？:D 后来到了高处的观景台上，又看到更多颜色厂牌各异的老车。其他游客也纷纷拿出手机相机，对着这些耀眼的明星一通狂拍。=) 你觉得这些老爷车怎么样？尝试过驾驶类似的拖拉机吗？哈哈，我很好奇自己能否在十八弯的高山公路上hold住这些大家伙，不敢想象我这种小只生物杵在这种拖拉机上是什么样的画面…… All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for reading.

Today I’m sharing my photo journal of a beautiful weekend - great quality time spent with family and friends. It’s the anniversary of Tongerlo Abbey in Belgium, so there’s an event of celebration with beers, snacks, music performance and vespers in the church. And it happened to be sunny, so everything looked even more pleasant. The climate is a bit weird this year in Europe right? Normally it’s pretty chilly already at this time of the year in Western Europe. But yeah, nobody is complaining about the warm sunshine. At least I don’t mind. Stay even longer please! :) ## 大家好！今天分享的是周末在比利时的Tongerlo修道院度过的美好时光。比利时国家虽小，啤酒却有两千多种，它历史上的最初酿造也是起源于修道院。这里的啤酒文化被联合国教科文组织列为人类非物质文化遗产。各种啤酒也有自己专属的玻璃杯，一般都印有名称和商标，有不少还有独特的外形。据说如果有酒保将啤酒倒错玻璃杯，轻则被众人耻笑，重则丢掉饭碗，可见比利时人对啤酒是有多上心~ 呵呵。 Now follow me for a tour in this lovely abbey and its back garden: ##First, it’s the church and a court yard with a typical Flemish style. Pardon me for this incomplete view of the building - I was using a prime lens, and it’s already the furthest spot I could run to for the photo… ;) .jpg) ##Tongerlo Abbey was founded in 1128 in honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and it used to be quite influential in the district of Northeast Belgium and the south of the Netherlands. Since 1545, this Abbey has been home to a replica of “The Last Supper” by Leonardo Da Vinci. It’s a valuable copy, since it reveals many details that are no longer visible in the deteriorated original fresco. ##这座修道院建立于1128年，曾在比利时西北和荷兰南边的地区很有影响力。1545年以来一直藏有达芬奇大作《最后的晚餐》的复制品。由于原壁画历经沧桑损毁，很多细节已经不复存在，而这幅复制品为现今的研究提供了很多珍贵的参考。 ##After the entrance, you will see these beer stands. Belgium is a small country, but it boasts over 2,000 different beers, each of which requires a unique glass. Belgian beer culture is listed by UNESCO as intangible cultural heritage of humanity. Like chocolates, French Belgian fries and waffles, it’s something Belgians are pretty proud of. So don’t miss the chance to try them out if you come here! ##早在12世纪时，比利时的修道院就开始酿造啤酒。那个时候，饮用水不像现在这么干净，所以酒精度相对较低的啤酒成为了更为卫生的饮料。起初，当地的修道院得到天主教堂的允许，通过酿造并发放啤酒来筹集资金。接下来的几个世纪里，酿酒方式逐渐发展成熟，一直到19世纪中前期，第一座特拉普派修道院啤酒厂开始运营，而当时可是只有修道士才能享用啤酒呢。 ##Since we are now in an abbey, we are served with their own beer. In fact, beer brewing started in abbeys in Belgium dating back to the 12th century. At that time, the relatively low-alcohol beer was seen as a more sanitary option than drinking water. The local abbeys first brewed and distributed beer as a fund raising method under the Catholic Church’s permission. In the following centuries, the brewing methods have been evolving. Only until the 19th century, the first Trappist brewery in Belgium started operation, and that beer was exclusively for the monks. .jpg) ##As you can see from this green list, 3 Tongerlo beers with different alcoholic strengths are offered: 从下面的酒单上（那张寒碜的绿纸 ;)），就能看到三种不同酒精度的Tongerlo啤酒: .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) ##The “abbey beers” are similar in style or presentation to monastic beers. Tongerlo beer is one of the 18 certified Abbey beers in Belgium. It’s brewed in Boortmeerbeek by Brouwerij Haacht. (Hehehe, long Dutch/Flemish words… ;p) You can see here from the photo: the church and its image on the beer glass. As I mentioned earlier, Belgians are quite serious with their beer glasses. Each different beer has its own branded glass, many of which even has a unique shape. I heard some bartenders are frowned upon or disqualified if they pour a beer into an unmatched glass. =) ##Tongerlo啤酒是比利时18种认证修道院啤酒之一，从下图中可以看到它的酒杯设计 — 印有后面教堂的图案： .jpg) ## Of course, you can also drink tea, coffee or wine if you are not a fan of beers: 当然，如果你不喜欢喝啤酒，也有茶、咖啡、红酒等其他选择： .jpg) ##Enjoy some music performance while drinking and chatting in the yard. The friendly monks are having fun as well: 伴着乐队的演奏，在和煦的阳光下边喝边聊，真是惬意。修道士们也玩得很high，当然这个high是相对于一般比较拘谨的弗莱芒人，且身处这样一个宗教性的地方来说，如果是在南部各种狂欢节盛行的瓦隆区，甚或拉美，那这种庆祝又会是另一番疯狂景象啦。 .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) And there’s finger food too. I was happily trying out a wide selection of snacks, like different types of cheese and ham, olives, raisins… and yummilicious deserts - cheese cakes, strawberry cakes and chocolate cakes. Hmmm, so satisfying… But I only took this one food photo below, perhaps because it’s not in Asia, and no other people were pesky bloggers like me who were crazy about taking pictures of food, haha… So I kind of forgot about this snapping shots thing when eating! And it’s a bit out of focus when I was holding food in another hand. ;p Otherwise I’m sure the pictures of the deserts will make you drool… :D 除了喝的，小吃也很丰富。各种奶酪、火腿、橄榄、葡萄干、蛋糕等，尤其是比利时巧克力做的蛋糕，很少会让人失望。又是吃到要扶墙而出！但是可能因为不在亚洲，身边也没有喜欢给美食拍照的欧洲人（为神马这不在意大利？！），我受到环境影响，竟然也只顾着狂吃，只想起来拍了一张食物照片。拍的时候，另一只手还举着个橄榄，连这些火腿片都拍虚了，哈哈。可惜啊，那些制作精美的蛋糕还是很上相滴！ .jpg) A cute baby boy in the family and his parents: 下面来组跟拍 — 可爱的一家子： .JPG) .JPG) ##Playing with Mama is always so fun: 这世间，谁能爱你超过你妈？好吧，你爸也有可能。 .jpg) .JPG) ##Hmmm, how does the leaf taste? 嗯，不知这片叶子味道如何？ .jpg) .jpg) Squeeeeezed by love: :D 也许生个孩子出来就该磨练他？;) .jpg) Now let’s move on to the back garden, a green natural space full of flowers and fruit trees! 后花园里一片绿，鲜花争奇斗艳，水果挂满枝头，美好的秋天~ ##These pears might look a bit strange, but I heard that the jam made out of them tastes good: 这种黄梨虽然长得不咋地，据说做成果酱还是挺可口的： .jpg) ##Prunes fresh off the tree: 刚采摘的西梅： .jpg) ##Pink pink rose: 玫瑰、月季，还是蔷薇？为啥中文要这么精确？！ .jpg) ##We get lucky - even spot a few white peacocks. It’s not so common to see them like their blue buddies: 幸运地看到三只白孔雀，跟蓝孔雀比起来，貌似更加珍稀，我突然想到四叶草 VS 三叶草 ☘ ： .jpg) .jpg) Now let’s walk back to the church for the vespers: 现在，让我们走回教堂去参加晚祷吧： .jpg) ## I didn’t take photos during the vespers, and here’s the music scene afterwards: 祷告仪式当然不好拍照，所以只拍了接下来的音乐演奏： .jpg) ##You are probably like me - having seen numerous churches, but this interior is still pretty neat right? 可能你也看过无数教堂，已经审美疲劳，但是这白色的内厅还是挺别致齐整的，对吗？ .jpg) Come out to the greeeeeeen lawn (also very neat) and visit the little house there: 出了教堂，来到一片绿得发光、让有洁癖者也感动到泪流满面的大草坪。跟我走进这个小房子看看喽： .jpg) ##Look at these beautiful mechanics indside the house: 里面有着美妙的机械杰作： .jpg) .jpg) ##On the wall, you get a view of the whole abbey area. Hmmm, a good place for some drone photography: 墙上可以看到整个修道院地区的俯视图，用无人机应该能拍出不错的效果： .jpg) Ok, now it’s time to finish our trip.

Recently @sndbox kicked off their #cryptodots challenge - to create your favorite crypto currency logo. And the topic this week is - Connecting the Dots. Steemians are tasked to download a dot grid (see the last image) and to illustrate a crypto logo they like. Without any doubt, my favorite crypto at the moment is Steem, :D but since I did a sketch of it (on the right) already in my self-introduction post, now I’d love to try something different. I’ve always loved the clean and geometric design of Nebulas coin’s logo, so I’m recreating it in this challenge. https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmPW7gwC1EXXg9CJeQKVwaRYvNXKbLypJwQLVBRQkszdDp/steemitlogod.jpeg As you can see from my drawing in the head image, the logo of Nebulas is formed in sharp black lines. I am fond of its concept of two intersecting platforms. Have you spotted that at first glance? For the purpose of connecting dots, I turned the whole logo in 45 degrees when making it. So tilt your head a bit when you look! ;) Do you like my entry? Please tell me what you think in the comments below! Here is a brief introduction of the crypto -Nebulas from their website. Its website design is also one of my favorites among all the sites of cryptocurrencies I know of. Nebulas is a next generation public blockchain, aiming for a continuously improving ecosystem. Based on its blockchain valuation mechanism, Nebulas proposes future-oriented incentive and consensus systems, and the ability to self-evolve without forking. I believe this fun challenge is an awesome way to combine art and the crypto world, and to effectively engage the Steemit community. So if you are interested too, don’t hesitate to check out @sndbox’s page and join the fun! =) ## 大家好！这是我参加Sndbox举办的“连接点”画加密货币图标的活动。我画的是Nebulas的logo，因为比较喜欢它简洁的几何黑白设计。 为了更好地连接那些点，我在画图的时候，把原logo倾斜了45度角，所以你在看的时候记得也把头或屏幕转一下~ 哈哈。你觉得我改造的这个图标怎么样？欢迎留言评论。: ) 如果你也喜欢涂涂画画，记得去参加这个有意思的活动哦！只要选择任意一种加密币的图标，用连接点的方式画出来就可以啦。一起来玩吧！ Thank you for reading.

Today I want to share my photos and experience hiking towards Cerro Fitz Roy mountain from the village El Chaltén in Argentina. It is one of my most unforgettable treks filled with epic views along the way. I love the color palette in the magic of beautiful fall foliage. ##大家好！今天我来分享在阿根廷菲茨罗伊山（烟雾山）地区的一次徒步经历。我很喜欢在充满野趣的大自然里徒步，这一次也是众多徒步中印象很深的一次。虽然来回走了一整天有点累，但是一路风景无敌，美不胜收。很庆幸选择在秋天时去那里，漫山红叶映衬着浅浅蓝绿色调的冰川雪山，仿若油画，随便一拍就像一张明信片！ ##El Chaltén is a charming village located in the Los Glaciares National Park, near the border between Argentina and Chile. It is surrounded by magnificent peaks and stunning glacial lakes. This location makes El Chaltén a popular base for hiking trails. So it is named Argentina’s Trekking Capital. I feel it’s a bit more quiet and peaceful hiking in this region than in the more well-known Torres del Paine national park in Chile. ##烟雾山镇就在冰川国家公园里，离智利边境很近。因为周围的山峰和冰川湖太美，引来大批人以此为据点徒步，被誉为“阿根廷徒步之都”。我个人也觉得在这块地区远足的时候，周遭的环境相比有名的智利百内国家公园更为宁静。这里居民不多，几乎全靠旅游业为生，不是开民宿就是开小店，家家洋溢着艺术气氛，这也是阿根廷这个国家给我的印象，跟粗犷的智利相比总体要文艺不少。也有可能是因为我在智利住过，而对阿根廷只是游客，所以没有深入了解而导致印象肤浅吧。=) Are you ready now to follow my steps to the peaks? Let’s go! In the early morning, we start the long hike from our airbnb in El Chaltén. After some easy walking, we reach this river and a small hydro station. The glacier water is super clear and cold, and even tastes a bit sweet (or is it because we are too thirsty? ;p), so we fill our bottle with this precious aqua from the stream: Soon a wooden sign comes to sight. “Laguna de Los Tres”, that’s right! The stunning turquoise lake flanked by the three peaks (Los Tres)! It’s a picture of this lake with the jagged granite spires that brought me to El Chaltén. Now I’m a bit closer to my destination: ##.jpg) ##.jpg) ##Spanish moss or Old Man’s Beard is a common plant here in the woods: ##.jpg) ##.jpg) ##Walking through the native woods, we already have a view of the unique mountains and glaciers:.jpg) ##Later, we come to the starting point of the National Park of the Glaciers:.jpg) ##Look at this sign of reminder. So true! In many cases, we humans are at the disposal of the almighty Mother Nature, even when it’s not at such a wild place:.jpg) ##You see the dead,.jpg) ##and the new life:.jpg) After some more hiking, we reach the outlook - Mirador Glacier Piedras Blancas. These are the views I captured from here: ##The main peak in the photos is the shining star - Cerro/Monte Fitz Roy, also known as Cerro Chaltén. “Chaltén” means smoking mountain in the local language of the nomadic hunters in Patagonia. Since the peak is covered by clouds most of the time, the natives believed it was a volcano. But when we were there, it’s mostly sunny and pretty clear around the peak. :) ##烟雾山的名称来自当地游牧民族的语汇，由于山顶终年云雾缭绕，所以他们琢磨这大概是座火山吧。=) 但是，我们在那边的时候都碰上晴天，山顶看上去还挺清晰呢~ ##to be continued… 未完待续 All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for reading.

Today I’d like to share with you my awesome lunch experience in a Japanese restaurant in Germany. Japanese food has been so popular not only in Asia but all over the world. I’ve seen Japanese restaurants in almost every major city I traveled to across 6 continents, but many of them in the West only sell sushi rolls, and quite a lot are opened by locals or Chinese. What a great shame! I know, we Chinese people seem to have a reputation of running restaurants everywhere, selling localized shitty Chinese food or even Japanese food! ;p Although not all of them is bad (like the best fries/chips shop here in Belgium is said to be run by Chinese), I believe when it comes to Japanese food, most foodies still want to try the authentic one made by Japanese people who have an intimate cultural connection with it. And I was lucky to have this chance during our recent trip in Germany. :D ##你听过德国的中世纪古城罗滕堡吗，这个有着童话色彩的小镇处处是五彩缤纷的尖顶房屋，位于有名的浪漫之路和城堡之路的交界处，所以受到各国游人的青睐。尤其是亚洲的访客，被这里迥异的欧洲古镇风情所吸引，很多人前来一探究竟。 因为日本游客数量众多，当我看到这里的一家日式餐厅时，立刻预感会是一个不错的选择。毕竟在西方世界，尤其非亚洲移民聚居的地方，能找到一家比较正宗的日餐，还真不是件容易的事情，通常看到家所谓的日式餐厅，结果进去一看，除了卖寿司卷，就是卖卷寿司，很多时候的区别只是在于卷法的不同，很难指望能吃到碗热气腾腾的豚骨拉面或亲子盖饭之类的抚慰肠胃和心灵的暖食~ 那么罗滕堡的这家小餐馆怎么样呢？现在就请大家跟我一起来看看吧： .jpg) ##It was in the fairy-tale dream place - Rothenburg, a well-preserved medieval town on the crossing of Germany’s famous Romantic Road and Castle Road. I will show you this lovely town in my coming posts with loads of photos and drone videos, but wait, this time it is about a restaurant there. :) When our car was about to enter the town, our stomachs started to rumble. Having tried plenty of German specialties through the years, it’s time to return to the Asian destiny. So I typed “Asian Restaurants” on Googlemap, and this Japanese restaurant - Louvre popped up, together with a few other Asian ones. My immediate thought is we should try this one out, as I read that Rothenburg is quite popular among Asian tourists, and there’s a great number of Japanese visitors each year. And we happened to enter from the northern gate of the ancient town wall, where it’s very close to the restaurant. Perfect! So a few minutes later, we came to this street: ##The entrance is pretty small with a Japanese flag on the lamp. I was happy to see the Japanese characters on the black board and some typical decor inside - all good signs showing its authenticity! On the other side of the wall, you see its name - Louvre Galerie Restaurant. So a Chinese and a Belgian are going to have lunch in this Japanese restaurant with a French name in Germany. Hmmm, sounds international? :) .jpg) ##As we came a bit too early, there were no other customers yet, so we just picked a table close to the door. It’s not a big space, but nice and cozy. You can see almost all corners of it from my 4 photos below. That means no table was far from the windows, which ensured the bright natural light. I was fond of their traditional Japanese elements with a modern twist. It also fit in the centuries-old German house, and the paintings inside reminded you that it’s also a “galerie”. Look at the black wooden table and the ancient stone seats. What a smart and wonderful match! .jpg) .jpg) ##A girl came to greet us with a big smile and lots of bows, like what Japanese waitresses normally do. She was super sweet and friendly, and spoke English with a Japanese accent. Another great sign! =) They also offered brochures for tourists, and even a few books to read when waiting to be served. Very considerate, weren’t they? .jpg) .jpg) ##So now let’s have a look at their menu! There were 2 set meals, named respectively after “crane” and “turtoise”, the 2 creatures seen as ausbicious in Japanese and Chinese cultures. Since summer was gone and it’s already getting chilly, we didn’t feel like eating sushi. And sushi rolls are easy to be found, but not this type of genuine Japanese restaurant in the Western world.  When I saw the wide selection of real Japanese food on their menu, I felt exhilarated. If you are also an Asian foodie fanatic, you know I’m not exaggerating! :) It’s not that easy to find Ramen, Udon or Don(rice bowl) in a localized Japanese restaurant in Europe. ##So we ordered a portion of Gyoza (homemade dumplings) and 2 warm meals. You will see what they are soon! ;) ##And of course they had various rolls too! The list went on, but I thought it’s enough to take 6 pictures of the menu to give you a glimpse of the food there. Have you noticed that they applied a different color name to each Maki set? Also, a plant name was given to each Sushi set including Nigiris. If you are wondering the difference between Maki and Nigiri, they are 2 types of Sushi - Maki is usually rolled or wrapped with seaweed and other ingredients, while Nigiri is mostly made with only raw fish slice and rice. ##First, the girl served us 2 cups of tea. We ordered sencha and genmaicha, both Japanese green tea with whole leaves, the later had roasted popped brown rice in it. It was the exact refreshing grassy flavor I expected. They placed a squash on each table, and I loved this yellow one. Do you feel the slight autumn touch? :) .jpg) ##Soon, the pork with ginger sauce was ready. It came with rice and soup at 9.3 euros. The price was actually on the lower end, comparing to the average cost in a Japanese restaurant in this part of Europe, like in a big city in Germany or Belgium or France, where the same set is easily over 15 euros. Together with its great quality, friendly and fast service, cozy atmosphere and amazing location, I had no idea what else we could ask for. .jpg) ##.jpg) ##It’s hard for me to resist the temptation of eel rice whenever they offer this choice on the menu. Unfortunately, it has always been more expensive than most other meals. I’m actually a fan of hot and spicy food, but this meal is one of the exceptions. Fortunately, the eel rice here didn’t let me down. When the smooth eel and rice dipped in sweet sauce touched the tip of my tongue, it felt like in heaven! And I devoured it in less than 5 minutes like usual. ;) Yes, this is the magic of eel rice - nothing else exists when I’m eating it. :D .jpg) ##After we finished the gyozas, pork rice and eel rice, an older lady in apron came out to greet us and asked if everything was good. This was a sweet personal touch - if you can’t kiss the cook, at least you get to talk to her ;). We were very happy with the food and service, but I still felt a bit hungry. No, that’s not the problem of their food portion, it’s just I could eat a lot, plus I didn’t have breakfast, haha. ;) So… I ordered fried rice with seafood (9.5 euros). I know I was crazy, but I had to grab this opportunity when there’s anthentic Asian food. ;p The lady chef smiled and nodded, and she went back to the kitchen. In a few minutes, my last serving was out. It tasted as divine as the eel rice: fresh seafood and tender prawns, sticky rice and crunchy vegetables, all combined to a yummylicious treat. I was so stuffed!  .jpg) ##The cost of this meal was less than 50 euros, and it could be less for 2 people, as we simply ordered too much - 2 cups of tea, gyozas, and 3 rice meals. As I mentioned earlier, it was excellent in terms of food quality, service, value for money, atmosphere and location. I especially liked the intimate family feel in its small but cozy space. Later I found it’s rated 4.7 on Google Review and 4.5 on Tripadvisor based on hundreds of customers’ experience. I highly recommend this gem to you if you visit Rothenburg and would love to try some genuine Japanese food.  All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 ———————### Restaurant InformationLouvreKlingengasse 15, 91541 Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Germany—————————————–Authentic Japanese Food Experience in a German Medieval TownThis post participated in the Tasteem contest Your weekly choice What is Tasteem?

Today I’d love to show you the Port House of Antwerp I captured in the evening. Antwerp is the capital of Belgium’s Flemish region. It is not as known as big shining cities like Paris, London or New York, but it is a gem. Lonely Planet calls this city: The country’s capital of cool.A powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. I once wrote a post about the beautiful Groenplaats in this city, and another post about a disappointed girl By the Scheldt River of Antwerp (1). Check them out if interested. This time, let’s have a look at a striking architecture by the Scheldt River! ## ##The Port House is Antwerp Port Authority’s head office. It houses over 500 employees and acts as a meeting place for the international contacts of the port community. Besides the open-plan offices, it includes meeting rooms, a restaurant, a 90-seat auditorium, and an observation room. Wondering how it feels like working here? You can join a guided tour inside the building during daytime. It is designed by the famous architect Zaha Hadid, whom was born in Iraq and known for her unique bold style in architectures. Unfortunately, she passed away just a few months before this Port House was completed. To remember her achievements, the square in front of this building was named after Hadid. So when you look at my photos here, what’s the first thing you notice? The eye-catching glass-covered façade I guess? This sparkling modern structure refers to Antwerp, the diamond city. It also symbolises the dynamic and innovative nature of the port, a port that is ready for the future challenges. ## ##The facade of this huge “diamond” is made up of triangular window panels, some of which are reflective and some of which are transparent. The panels shimmer like rippling waves, and they reflect the interaction of changing shades and colours in the sky. It is a referral to the building’s location surrounded by water. The house you see under the modern expansion is an old fire station in Hanseatic style. Since it’s requested to group the technical and administrative services in one location, this house had to be integrated with some extra space. So Zaha Hadid eventually worked out this design of stunning two entwined volumes in 2009. From my photos, you can also see an external bridge connecting the existing house with the new structure. ## ## ##The window design helps in regulating the amount of sunlight entering the building, and plays a role in the sustainable nature for the construction, such as a bore hole-energy-storage system that takes care of the heating and the cooling, and an optimum daylight linking system that limits the need for artificial lighting. Sounds pretty cool right? ##What do you think of these shots and the building? Have you been to Antwerp or Belgium?

As required by the contest, participants are to design a pair of horses in gold and burgundy colors, with HKCEXP logo in them. You can do that with software or hand drawing. I’ve always enjoyed drawing and coloring by hands. The process calms me down. So I chose to make a sketch and color it with pencils. As the star logo of HKCEXP looks pretty complicated, I simplified it in my sketch version. And in order to keep the same branding, I also did a version with the original logo in. So I kind of combined both hand drawing and software to make 2 versions of the mascot. ##Here’s the breakdown: Step 1: ## Step 2: ## Step 3: ##After I finished coloring, it looked like this: ##So I first uploaded it to my laptop and blended in the original logo: ##After that, I went on drawing with pencils to add the “HKCEXP” and the simplified stars: ## When the lighting changes: ##So that’s it for my designing process.

Beautiful smile, isn’t it? 回程途中，我和同车的其他几个新认识的旅伴一起参观了这家当地人的住处。如果我的破烂西班牙语没有理解错的话，这对夫妇应该是小男孩的祖父母，他的父母当时离家在别处工作。题图的这张照片是我在他们家门口抓拍的，祖母正在等着她丈夫进屋，脸上绽放出灿烂的笑容，幸福真的就像花儿一样~。 ##These indigenous Kichwa people are descendants of the Incas, the largest of the 13 indigenous communities in Ecuador. They speak Kichwa/Quichua, which is an Ecuador variety of Quechuan languages, a native South American language family spoken primarily in the Andean mountainous regions. From the 2 photos above, you can see the Kichwa women’s traditional clothing: a durable felt hat, a bright synthetic sweater, shawls held over the shoulder, a vibrant skirt, long stockings and black leather shoes. All these keep them warm high up in the Andes mountains, at an elevation of almost 4000 meters. ##这些安第斯山区的土著居民被称作Quechua，主要居住在秘鲁，玻利维亚和厄瓜多尔，在哥伦比亚，智利和阿根廷的山区也有分布。 Quilotoa这块地区的山民是古印加国民的后代，是厄瓜多尔十三个原住民聚居区中人口最多的一个。插播一句：厄瓜多尔这个国家麻雀虽小却五脏俱全，从西到东，海滩、高原、丛林都有，迥异的地理环境自然会孕育多样的原住民文化。 在这寒冷的海拔近四千米的高原地区，原住民女性们都戴着传统的毡帽，穿着色彩鲜艳的羊毛衫或外套，暖和的大披肩，下身继续色彩鲜艳的中长裙，厚厚的长筒袜，脚穿黑皮鞋。可能你会觉得她们衣服的颜色搭配有些神奇， 但在南美这片神奇的土地上，这种轰轰烈烈的大红大紫却很稀松平常。我当时去还是初夏时节，穿着一件外套爬到山顶，已经被火山湖边缘的凛冽寒风吹得瑟瑟发抖，不禁羡慕起她们保暖的传统装束来。 I’ll show you how their living environment looks like and the hundreds of guinea pigs they kept in their house in my coming post. Stay tuned and see you soon! :) 接下来的帖子里我会继续展示他们的居住环境，比如他们和几百只豚鼠住一起的视频，还有那苍莽连绵、如梦如幻的安第斯山脉~。 All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for reading.

Today is December 6th, Saint Nicholas (Sinterklaas in Dutch) Day here in Belgium. So I’m sharing some stories I know and a few pictures I took about this festival. Hope you will enjoy them! :) ##各位好啊~ 今天是12月6号，在荷兰比利时卢森堡等地是传统的圣尼古拉斯节。尼古拉斯这个白胡子老人据说就是圣诞老人的原型哦！这篇文章我就结合今天刚拍的照片来分享一下这个节日的故事。（我和黑皮特白马合影的照片是挖坟6年前的…… 因为今天在街上只看到吃的~） ## ##According to legend, Saint Nicholas is a patron saint of children. This older cousin of Santa Claus is especially popular in regions like the Netherlands, Belgium, northern France, part of Germany, Luxembourg and the former Dutch colonies including Suriname and Curaçao. In some other Christian countries such as Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and USA, this tradition is also celebrated, but in varied ways. Here in Belgium and the Netherlands, the main figures of this festival are Sinterklaas, his horse and Zwarte Piet (Black Pete), his helper. ##这个节日在各个基督教国家有着不同的庆祝方式。在荷兰比利时这边，主要出场的有圣尼古拉斯 — 孩子的守护神，他的坐骑马儿和帮手 — 黑皮特。 Sinterklaas圣尼古拉斯 ##As the primary source of Santa Claus (just think about it - New York City used to be New Amsterdam founded by the Dutch), Sinterklaas is depicted as an elderly man dressed in red, with white hair and beard. Since I am curious about the differences between these 2 festive figures, I checked online and found this fun comparison: Sinterklaas VS. Santa - 8 Humorous Differences https://i1.wp.com/www.invadingholland.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inv_sint_home.jpg?zoom=4&amp;resize=600%2C315&amp;ssl=1 https://i2.wp.com/www.invadingholland.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inv_sint_gifts.jpg?zoom=4&amp;resize=600%2C315&amp;ssl=1  the 2 images are from the same source listed above ##If you want a clearer vision, here’s a form from Diffen.com : ##The origin of Sinterklaas is the historical figure of Saint Nicholas (270 – 343), a Greek bishop. Now you see why there’s always a cross pattern involved, be it a fabric decoration or a coffee cup. .JPG) .JPG) ##Most believe that Sinterklaas comes from Spain, possibly because half of Saint Nicholas’ relics were transported to Bari, the Italian city that formed part of the Spanish Kingdom of Naples later. Sinterklaas carries a gold-coloured crosier and a big red book. From the book he can tell if the kids have been well-behaved or naughty in the past year. His Horse守护神的坐骑 ##His horse is called Amerigo in the Netherlands, and Slecht Weer Vandaag (meaning “Bad Weather Today”, so true, haha, it’s been gloomy today again… This also reminds me of “Friday” in Robinson Crusoe). Sometimes you see the horse in white color, sometimes it’s gray, you never know… But don’t worry, it’s only a legend anyway… and it’s good, since as such you can get both white horse chocolate (more cocoa butter, very fat) and dark horse chocolate (more cocoa mass, still fat), isn’t it? ;) .JPG) Black Pete帮手黑皮特 ##Zwarte Piet (Black Pete), the helper is said to be a Moor from Spain. So his face is usually painted black, and he wears colorful Moorish clothing with a feathered cap and a lace collar, based on 16th-century noble attire. Or, to avoid the problem of being perceived as racist or associated with slavery, some people say that Zwarte Piet’s face is blackened with soot when climbing through chimneys to deliver gifts for Sinterklaas. Legend has it that Sinterklaas tossed golden coins through the window of 3 young girls to pay their dowries, so they were saved from prostitution. This could be why chocolates wrapped like gold coins are one of the traditional treats from Zwarte Piet’s bag. Except for climbing chimneys and offering treats, Zwarte Piet has been developed over the years as a multi-functional superman, who could help Sinterklaas in almost everything, such as navigating the steamboat from Spain to the Netherlands and Belgium, and wrapping all the gifts to children. So you normally see more than one Black Pete in colorful costume accompanying Sinterklaas. ;) .JPG) Arrival and Parade到达 + 游行 ##Traditionally, in mid-November, children start to welcome the arrival of Sinterklaas and Zwarte Piet by a steamboat from Spain. They reach Belgium at the port of Antwerp, while in the Netherlands, the arrival port can be different each year. For other towns without any ports, no worries, they arrive at the train station or anywhere convenient for a certain transportation tool. =) During Sinterklaas’ parade through the streets on his horse, Zwarte Piet helps him throw candies and round cookies (called kruidnoten or pepernoten) into the cheering and singing crowd. You can watch this popular event live on TV in the Netherlands and Belgium. .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) Gift Time!交换礼物 ##My Belgian families and friends told me about their sweet memories from childhood: on Saint Nicholas’ Eve (evening of December 5th), most children put a shoe (or shoes if the kid wants more presents ;)) next to the fireplace or the central heating radiator. The shoe is usually filled with a carrot or some hay for the horse, a poem or wish list for Sinterklaas, and a bottle of beer for Zwarte Piet is placed next to the shoe. Sometimes they also offer a cup of coffee for Sinterklaas and sing a song. :) The next morning the kids would be happily finding the shoe full of treats - typically include mandarin oranges, speculaas cookies, gingerbread biscuits, chocolate coins, marzipan figures and other sugary confection. Chocolate letter in the first letter of the child’s name is also a pupolar present. However, in most parts of the Netherlands, the gift-giving happens in the evening of December 5th (called Sinterklaasavond or Pakjesavond), and the treats from Sinterklaas are a bit different. ##The treats I got today, not from a shoe but from a shop (reality bites in adults’ world ;p) : 下面是我今天的礼物，因为不是小孩子了，所以不是从鞋子里找到，而是店里买的，哈哈： .JPG) Guessing Game Time!猜图时间到！ ##At last, let’s play a little guessing game. What are these objects in the following photo I took? The first Steemian who gives the correct answer gets 1 Steem, and the second person who gets it right will receive 0.5 Steem. Ok, give it a go now!

Hmmm, so did they get it right? ## ##大家最近好吗？我这几天忙成狗，很少玩Steemit，但是，现在到了揭晓七天前猜图答案的重要关头，我必须抽空爬上来冒个泡！  上周12月6号是圣尼古拉斯节，我写了篇关于这个节日的帖子，结尾郑重地放了枚小彩蛋，让大家猜猜我照片里拍的是什么。下面是各位给出的答案： @starrouge： 巧克力或者糖果盒@hmayak： 巧克力豆@sunai： 類似涼糕的小點心@tanlikming： 糖果@alvin0617：巧克力@kelvinzhang： 石头@ericet： 巧克力@aaronli： 朱古力豆@kidsreturn： 夹心糖@honoru： 糖果@windowglass： 火鸡蛋@annepink： 鸵鸟蛋@cherryzz：巧克力糖@tydebbie： Chocolate or dessert ##那么，正确答案是什么呢？？准备好了吗？擦亮你的眼睛，请看我咬开这些东西之后的照片： Here’s the answer (druuuuuum rooooooll please…): .JPG) ##如果你没看清楚，下面这张照片的标签上有名字 — Marzipan Stones，也就是杏仁糖豆！主要成分是杏仁和糖，鉴于它们周围也包了一小层巧克力，我决定把钱分给提到糖和巧克力的各位盆友！不好意思，猜石头和蛋的几位对不住了，虽然很有创意我喜欢，但实在是差得有点远，哈哈哈~  As you can see from the picture below, they are Marzipan Stones! The main ingredients are marzipan, so no one offered the exact answer. But there’s indeed a tiny bit of chocolates lining the marzipan, so I am going to give the rewards to Steemians who guessed sweets or chocolates! =) .JPG) ##Marzipan是个德语词，这种杏仁软糖在欧洲各地很常见，有各种外形，比如做成金条状和水果状，软乎乎的挺可爱~ 我刚查了下，说是起源于意大利。下面还有几张也是我当天拍的杏仁软糖，我买的小袋子里那几个小球也是软糯的marzipan，却伪装成一副巧克力的样子： Marzipan is mainly made of sugar or honey and almond meal, though it’s a German word, the birth place is said to be Italy.

It’s Thursday again, a day for images from Europe! :) So I’m sharing a shot by a drone (DJI Mavic Pro) above Lake Constance in Europe. I was at the sandy shore flying the little friend for a video of the lake region, and clicked this picture during its flight. It’s my entry for the #TravelPhotoContest by @lightcaptured, a great photographer on Steemit. I’ve seen his cool posts by curating for Steemitworldmap, and now I’m very excited to find his brand new contest that combines travel and photography. I guess this is not only my passion, but also lots and lots of other Steemians’, right? Check out the contest and join the travel photo fun! ## ##Lake Constance is known as Bodensee in German language. It is a huge lake that borders Austria, Germany and Switzerland. When I look at the seemingly endless lake surface from a certain angle, I feel it’s a vast sea, just like Lake Baikal and Lake Titicaca I visited before. Since I used to live and am living now in Belgium which boarders Germany, I frequently passed this lake during road trips, or stayed a few days at a town by the riverside. In summer, it’s a popular destination for water sports like sailing, windsurfing and swimming. It’s also relaxing to just sit by the river, reading, chatting or having a picnic. You can also pedal your bike around the entire lake on a cycle path for about 270km. I only tried driving but I believe it’s a great way to see the lake and the sites nearby. Will you give it a try? I would recommend the following places to visit along the way: Wollmatinger Ried: a nature reserve to protect the rich flora and fauna;Lindau: the largest town on the Bavarian shores;Konstanz: boasts a beautiful old town and a historic harbor;Mainau: a very touristic but amazing flower island;Reichenau: Lake Constance’s largest island that was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site and preserves the traces of the Benedictine monastery;Pfahlbaumuseum Unteruhldingen: an open-air museum displaying the German-style stilt houses;Allgäu upland: a picturesque mountain region between Lake Constance and the Lech valley. ##P.S. Consider view this photo via frontends other than Steemit.com, such as Steempeak, otherwise the not-so-good drone image quality could look even worse! ;) 大家好~ 今天分享的是用DJI无人机Mavic Pro在康斯坦茨湖上空俯拍的照片。我当时在湖边的沙滩上拍这个湖区的全景视频，小机机飞行途中看到几个角度还不错就也拍了几张照片。 这个大湖在德国、奥地利和瑞士交界处，面积大得常常让我产生错觉是在看海，就像去过的俄罗斯贝加尔湖和南美的滴滴咔咔湖一样，湖水清澈、一望无际、辽阔悠远。夏天的时候，很多人来这里玩水上运动，在湖边野餐、看书、跟家人朋友散散步聊聊天。或者，什么都不做，什么都不想，坐在湖边发发呆看看“海”，也自有一番舒心惬意~。 All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for reading.

The large market constructed in 1937 was in the shape of a dome with four arms, and it’s a busy place full of visitors. After I tried some great local food at one of the street stands outside, I walked towards this indoor market.

Today I’m going on sharing my stories about Christmas. It’s also my entry to @aaronli’s A City a Story contest themed “Christmas”. 3 years ago, I was living in Santiago de Chile. On a hot day around Christmas, I walked into a post office to buy stamps to send out my greeting cards. Just when I entered the office, I saw this special Christmas tree standing inside, and it’s made of paper boxes. In each box, there’s a kid’s drawing and/or writing expressing their wishes. Pretty creative, right? =) ## It reminds me of the Wish Tree Project by Yoko Ono. I first got to know her project in Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark. The museum provided white pieces of paper for visitors to write down wishes (see my picture below). Later these notes were tied around a branch of a Wish Tree. Wishes from different countries have been stored in the Wishing Well of the Imagine Peace Tower.##At Japan’s Tanabata festival, people write wishes on pieces of paper and hang them on bamboo trees, in hope that the tall straight bamboo send the wishes to heaven.I’m not sure if Yoko Ono was inspired by this festival, but it’s fascinating that a tree is commonly seen as a natural sanctuary in many cultures, and it’s identified as having a special traditional or spiritual significance. Trees are believed to be antennae for divine energies related to the heavens. People come to some selected trees to make wishes or offerings, in the form of coins, notes, fabrics, flowers…##It’s said that Native Americans pay respects to a ponderosa pine tree. They would hang objects like ribbon, meat, tobacco and coins on its branches to honor it. Sounds familiar? Perhaps this is the early Christmas tree? ;)When I lived in Queensland of Australia, I saw plenty tall Bunya Pine trees. They bear significant cultural connections to the indigenous groups too. When it’s harvest time, the originals came from all over to celebrate Bunya festival around these native trees. To them, these sacred trees did not only provide food, fuel and shelter, but also make their dreams come true.Hi大家好~ 今天继续圣诞树主题……3年前的圣诞期间，智利首都，烈日炎炎。那天，我走进市中心的邮局买邮票寄贺卡。刚走进大门，就在大厅一角看到上面这棵独特的圣诞树，这些红白相间的纸盒里，装着孩子们许下的心愿。或画或写，寄望于树，私以为这种用许愿树庆祝圣诞的方式还挺新颖的，你觉得呢？下面几张照片也是在这个邮局拍下的 — 许愿树旁边的大厅里，人们在写信看信，四周的墙上展示着圣诞主题的邮票。我又想到小野洋子在世界各地发起的许愿树活动，5年多前我在丹麦的路易斯安那现代艺术馆看到她的个展，提供了很多许愿纸条（右图），供访问者写下愿望，会挂在树上。最后，收集了世界各地一百多万张许愿单，存放在小野洋子在冰岛设计的梦想和平塔的许愿井中。##不知道小野有没有受到日本七夕节许愿树的启发，总之，世界各地文化中对树木的自然崇拜还是有着共通之处的。古人觉得树木直指天际，就像通向天堂的天线，可以帮助人类实现自己的愿望。所以，在全球的很多国家，都有寄望于树的传统，比如，我在澳洲的住处附近有很多大叶南洋杉，被土著居民视为神树，有专门的节日来庆丰收、祈愿等。还有北美土著心目中的圣树黄松，树枝上会被他们挂满丝带、烟草、肉类、硬币等以表敬意、供奉神灵。难道，这就是传说中圣诞树的由来？！*##In the hall next to this wishing tree, there were children working on their wish letters and post office staff receiving them: ##Beautiful interior of the post office:## Stamps about Christmas on the wall :墙上的邮票大都是关于耶稣的故事： ## ## ## All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for reading.

I miss the warm sunshine in the Southern Hemisphere, so I’m sharing with you a dancing video of me and other travellers in the desert of Bolivia!It was the January of 2017. My long journey traveling through South America almost came to an end. The Uyuni trip in Bolivia was my last one before going back to Chile to work. I got to know the Chilean couple and 2 Portuguese girls from the same jeep, and we improvised this group dance in the desert that morning. It looks silly, I know, but we had so much fun recording it.

Today I’m sharing a photo I took in Seville, Spain. It’s my entry to @lightcaptured’s #travelphotocontest themed PEOPLE IN THE CITY. The contest requires us to create a post with only one original photo work. So here it is: ##It was a windy winter day. I was walking to the riverside, and looked at the iconic monument - Torre del Oro (the Tower of Gold) at the other side of the street. It is a defensive watchtower erected by the Almohad Caliphate in order to control access to Seville via the Guadalquivir river. Dating back from the 13th century, the tower served as a prison during the Middle Ages. And now it’s open to public as a Maritime Museum. All of a sudden, a red bus came into my sight, and at the same time, a woman in red was running towards the opposite direction of the bus. It looked like a movie scene to me, so I captured this moment. What do you think of this shot? Tell me in the comments please. =) ##I love street photography, and I’d like to share more photos of this amazing city of Andalusia and its people, but to stick to the contest rule, I will wait till next time. :) Here are some images of people in the city on New Year’s Eve that I posted a few days ago: ##大家好~ 今天分享的是我在西班牙南部安达卢西亚地区的古城塞维利亚街头抓拍的一张照片。用来参加@lightcaptured的旅行摄影活动 — “城市中的人”。我很喜欢这个主题，城市中的人和美妙的大自然一样吸引我，都充满着探索的乐趣~。 那是一个冷风呼啸的冬日，天空阴沉，片片乌云笼罩着一座座蜜色的古老建筑。城里的好多棕榈树都被刮成爱因斯坦头。我正朝着河边走，望向马路对面那座有名的地标 — 黄金塔。这是13世纪建起来的防御瞭望塔，处于沿河的要塞位置。中世纪时曾经用作监狱，而如今作为海事博物馆向公众开放。 正看着，突然间，一辆红色的公交巴士驶入眼帘，同时，从反方向跑过来一枚红衣红帽拎着红包的时髦女纸，不知道她是不是要去赶那趟公交。这景象简直像是电影中的一幕，说时迟那时快，我便咔嚓下了这个瞬间。 不知你是否跟我一样，从《塞维利亚的理发师》知道了这座西班牙的古城，非常迷人的地方，还有很多影像想分享，但是这个活动要求只能发一张照片，那我就等以后吧~ :) All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for visiting!

It was snowing a bit here in Belgium. I had enough of the coldness, and just booked a flight to the island of Sardinia. Woohoo~  Hopefully it will be warmer and sunnier there. If not, I will still enjoy the pure joy of traveling in plane and exploring a new destination!  Have you visited Sardinia? Tell me your experience if you have.  It reminds me of my solo travels to another island of Italy - Sisily. It was also in February. :) So today I’m sharing some views I captured in Taormina on Sisily island. ##I took a local bus from Catania to Taomina to visit this well-known ancient theatre. From the town, I started to walk uphill. It was a beautiful hike. On my way, the cone of Etna volcano could be seen in distance, shrouded in fog and cloud from time to time. After passing loads of cacti and gravelstones, I reached the hilltop where the theatre spreaded before my eyes. ##The theatre’s construction was started by the Greeks around the third century BC, and later it was renovated and expanded by the Romans. This well preserved archaeological wonder is located in an amazing natural setting, with spectacular view toward the Calabrian and the Ionian coasts, and you can have a clear view of the famous peak of Etna if weather permits. It is a place that easily brings people back to the ancient times. It was winter time, so it’s pretty quiet, with around 5 visitors in total. I sat on the step half buried by green grass, facing the vast blue sea and imagining how people in the past was watching those grand shows here. Must be quite an experience, isn’t it? Later, on my way back to town, I arrived at a viewpoint at sunset, lucky me! So I got to see this splendid scene in the head image. 珞 Hope you enjoy this view as I did! ##大家好~ 不知你那里天气如何？比利时这里继续阴冷，今天还飘起小雪，想想去年这时候还在酷热的澳洲暴晒。。。造化弄人。。。我决定暂时逃离，下个月假期飞去个暖和点的小岛过年。一通搜索后，很快订下去意大利撒丁岛的机票。几年前的2月也是飞去了地中海的马耳他和意大利的西西里岛。今天分享的就是在西西里岛的小城陶尔米那爬山去看古剧场（第二张照片）的经历。第一张照片里是黄昏时下山途中拍的海景。 All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for visiting!

Here’s my shot of 2 monks at Phnom Bakheng near Siem Reap of Cambodia. It’s my entry for @daveks’ B&amp;W Photo Contest themed Colour Splash.&gt;Definition: The process of converting photos to monochrome, while keeping chosen details in colour.##When I saw this cool theme, the first images came to mind were the ones of monks in orange robe and dark grey temples. So I digged out this one I took in Angkor, and played with some color splash fun. :) I feel the bright-orange color of their robes forms a great contrast with the monochromatic towers and background. It’s also interesting to catch the young dynamic monks and the old static towers in one frame.What about you? Have you tried applying “color splash” before? What kind of images do you think are suitable for this touch?##Now a bit more info about the temple. =) Phnom Bakheng is located a bit north of Angkor Wat and south of Angkor Thom. Because it’s on the highest hill in the area, it’s been long attracting visitors for the sunset view over Angkor Wat. However, I was here during noon time, oops… so no sunset view but only a scorching fire ball right above my head… Hmmm, while the scene of these young monks in bright robe by the ancient temples is equally amazing, isn’t it?Phnom Bakheng, the architectural treasure is the state temple of the first Khmer capital in the Angkor region. As one of the oldest temples in Angkor Archaeological Park, it is a temple mountain built at the end of the 9th century in honor of the Hindu god Shiva.It sits on a rectangular base and rises in five levels. After climbing some steep stairs (the stairs were not that many, but the heat and humidity in the jungle made it pretty hard), I took this photo at the top level where it’s crowned by five main towers. These five sandstone sanctuaries stand in a quincunx pattern — one in the center and one at each corner of the level’s square. They were all in repair, and most of the original 108 small towers around the temple at different tiers had already collapsed.*##各位朋友周末好~ 今天分享的是关于柬埔寨巴肯寺的信息。题图的照片是我顶着炎炎烈日爬到寺庙顶层的平台后拍的，用“色彩喷溅”效果来突出僧人鲜亮的黄（或者是橙色？）袍，和周遭单色的环境形成对比。同时，我赶脚这两位充满活力的小和尚和旁边饱经风霜、静静矗立千年的古塔们同框，也是挺有意思的画面。你觉得呢？:)9世纪时，吴哥王朝国王耶输跋摩一世建都吴哥，在巴肯山上建立了这个印度教寺庙，用来供奉主神湿婆。巴肯寺是柬埔寨吴哥古迹中最古老的寺庙之一，也因为它在遗址群中的最高地势，成为很受游客欢迎的观日落地点。可惜我是正午时到的那里，只有一颗耀眼的大火球挂在头顶。虽然错过了看日落，但捕捉到这些年轻僧侣在古塔旁边的景象，我也很知足啦~All content by @itchyfeetdonicaPhoto shot with Canon Kiss X3图文 by Donica多 Thank you for visiting!

Time flies - I’ve joined Steemit for over a year, and I am grateful for many communities and friends that have been constantly supporting and inspiring me. To celebrate this anniversary and to give back to the Steem community, I am hosting a cross-culture challenge. (Thanks @Partiko for sponsoring part of the rewards!) Let’s join some fun in this bear market! :) ##So why a cross-culture challenge? ❓ Like I said in my intro post: I’m most enthusiastic about traveling, photography, cooking, art… I believe any traveler understands this wanderlust - you just can’t have enough. By traveling far and wide, you discover new ways of living and understand other cultures to appreciate them, you constantly get inspired and would ultimately better yourself. Especially when you travel solo, you set yourself free and interact more with locals. You start to judge less and accept more.…I do, like many of you foodies there, take great pleasure in eating and cooking. And I try to learn cooking from different cultures during my travels, to spice up my own experiments on food fusion… ##There is a great variety of cultures on this planet, and each culture has its own charm. Lived across 5 continets and traveled to over 60 countries, I have been mesmerised by all the different cultures. Steemians here come from all over the world with rich cultural backgrounds. It would be fun to exchange some ideas/photos/videos… Exchange makes change. Live and let live. So my challenge will focus on “cross-culture”. To join this challenge, you just need to compare 2 or more cultures that you have experienced. Any form of content is welcome, you can write a short essay, post a photo story, create a drawing/painting/animation/design, share a quick video, record your voice of talking or singing… all fine! It would be great to hear your personal stories soaking up in different cultures. Share your inspiration with us! ##Then what is culture? 類 Back in my uni course of Cultural Studies, there’s been heated discussion about what exactly culture is. To some extent, it seems almost everything can be seen as culture. To give you a bit inspiration, here’s one of the definitions: Culture is the characteristics and knowledge of a particular group of people, encompassing language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts, etc.. ##https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/itchyfeetdonica/YwGYWSTB-SingaporeKampongGlam.JPG photo by me in Kampong Glam, Singapore ##So that’s it, just go pick a cultural topic (language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts, etc..) from 2 or more particular groups of people that you are familiar with, and show the differences to us in a certain form. Inspire me and other Steemians! Tell us any culture shock you experienced or any changes it brought to you! Here are the rules and rewards  ##You can choose between leaving a short comment or making a longer post.Dealine：Feb 10, 2019 ## ⭐ RULES ⭐ ##1).

From the Atacama in the North to the Patagonia in the South, Chile is a fascinating country with so much to offer. I was lucky enough to work in the capital and in the lovely city Concepción later. I didn’t take so many photos in these 2 cities with my camera as I did when traveling to other destinations - I guess you know what I mean? Perhaps people take more pictures when they visit somewhere as a tourist, but kind of take it for granted and ignore the beauty around their living place. It’s great to see there are some challenges on Steemit to enrouge users to dicover and capture the moments in their daily life. So here we go! First let’s have an overview of the city from a hilltop: 大家好~ 今天分享一些在智利首都圣地亚哥的随拍。因为看到@wherein的「 带我看看，你的城市」活动，动员大家“拍摄你的城市瞬间”，觉得很有意思。最喜欢分享照片啦，然鹅。。。我现在住的地方在郊区，说得好听点就是回归大自然，难听点就是鸟都不拉屎，并没有城市瞬间可以分享。所以我想，还是来发些以前住过的城市的照片，比如其中的智利首都，这也是我加入Steem的初衷 — 督促自己整理海量影像。废话不多说，先上总览图，也就是爬到山顶俯瞰城市的照片： ##Cerro San Cristóbal is a hill offering a general view of Santiago. You can climb up on foot or take the funicular. The lookout area is also a great place to taste the traditional Chilean drink mote con huesillos (see the picture below). Made of a kind of grain(mote), dried peach(huesillo) and sugary water, this cold drink is truly refreshing in the heat. You can find this popular drink all over the streets in Santiago during summer time. Compared to the strong cocktail classic Pisco claimed as a creation by both Peru and Chile, this sweet drink works more magic for me. :) I talked about it in this post if you are interested. Besides, you can have fun at other sites on this hill, like the pools, the park, the zoo and the castle. 圣克里斯托巴山顶是一处俯瞰全城的宝地。当地人和游客都很喜欢来这个大自然公园玩耍。从下面的地图上可以看到，这片山上有动物园、圣母殿、游泳池、城堡等很多去处。自己爬上去或者坐缆车都可以。 山顶的凉亭里有贩卖智利国饮 - mote con huesillos（下图我喝的那杯）。以前在这个帖子里 (下面最后一张照片)讲过智利人和秘鲁人争抢的国饮 - 柠檬口味的皮斯科酸利口酒。而酒量不行如我，还是觉得这种传统的无酒精糖水更加清甜可口。它是用南美的小麦mote、干桃huesillo和糖水混合而成的。有点像薏米水，是智利夏天街头常见的消暑饮品。 It’s quite dry and sunny in summer time. So warm-toned photos are pretty common. As a result, the sunsets here are just brilliant. When it rains, the mostly snowcapped Andes mountains at the backdrop can be viewed more clear. It’s such a magnificent scene that appears frequently in postcards of the city. 这个城市离北边的沙漠地带不远，很干旱，夏天时经常是几个月都见不到一滴雨。也因此常有壮丽的落日景象。随便一拍就是暖色调，我喜欢，你呢？如果遇上罕见的雨水，远处苍莽连绵的安第斯山脉就越发清晰起来，白雪皑皑的群山环抱整座城的美景，也成为明信片上的常客。 ##This skyscraper is Costanera Center Torre 2, better known as Gran Torre Santiago (Great Santiago Tower). 64 stories, it is the tallest in Latin America. You can easily see this building from different corners of the city. 这座64层的高楼是圣地亚哥随处可见的地标，也是拉美最高的建筑。下面几层是商场，上面很多层空置，常年亏本。 ##Atop the hill, like Rio de Janeiro’s Christ the Redeemer, La Virgen (Virgin Mary) and her sanctuary overlooks the city. Though not as stunning as the view of Rio with all the bays and the vast sea, you can still have a taste of nature and enjoy the picturesque vista with the towering Andean mountains standing in distance. 就像巴西里约热内卢山巅的基督像一样（我文末的拼图里有照片），这里的山顶也有圣母玛丽亚俯瞰着整座城市的芸芸众生。虽然看不到里约那种惊世的绝美风景，毕竟人家有山有海有浅湾，还有数不清的热辣美女在沙滩上嬉戏，确实有点难以匹敌啊；也没有纽约香港这种繁华大都市的满眼摩天楼，但远眺下那一座座宏伟的安第斯山，在苍松翠柏、棕榈繁花的掩映下，呼吸点干燥的新鲜空气也不赖呀~ =) ##The following pictures are about the colorful streets/architectures in the city. They were mostly taken by an old crappy phone, so it might have hard time doing justice of the real vibrant colors there. :) 下面是一组反映多彩街道和建筑的随拍，因为是住在那里，也就很少带着相机到处拍，所以只是在路上看到什么有意思的就掏出小手机来咔嚓一下，而当时的手机已经是老古董，也许不能很好地还原那些多彩的瞬间。但号称南美最为保守的国家之一，在用色方面还是能亮瞎我们这些东亚人的眼，哈哈。。。倒是有点想念这片多彩的土地了~ .JPG) .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) ##Ok, so this one is mainly of people, and I’d love to share more people shots next time. :) 刚才发了一堆街头涂鸦和建筑类，再来张人物的，以后会分享更多人物的抓拍，毕竟再多彩的涂鸦和建筑，也都是人创造出来的。 .jpg) At last, some pictures about a market, since it’s #marketfriday initiated by @dswigle. I’m happy to join this challenge and share some market fun! =) My first appartment in Santiago is not far from Mercado Central de Santiago. You can buy fresh fish and seafood here, as well as dining in the food court indoors. Another popular produce market is La Vega Central. This lively expansive place will ensure you a full-on sensory experience, with all those diverse sights, smells and sounds. The fresh produce I miss the most from Chile is the avocado (they call it “palta” there) - so cheap, fresh and tasty! Also, cherries, stawberries, chirimoya, lúcuma, Maqui berries…  But since I saw myself as a local when living next to a big market, I didn’t take decent pictures there despite visiting it often. So I will share much more market photos in future from other places, such as the artstic city nearby - Valparaíso (because I went there as a tourist ;p)! 最后这几张是关于水果摊的。当时在圣地亚哥的第一间公寓就租在一个大市场旁边，作为一个圣地亚哥的“当地人”，几乎每天去那里买菜的我，是不屑于像个傻傻的游客一样到处瞎拍的，所以几乎没有找到什么市场的照片。下次会分享作为“游客”去旁边的嬉皮小城Valparaíso拍的市场，作为港口城市，那里的市场规模更大，沿着码头一字排开，很值得一看。智利有着长长的海岸线，一般的生鲜市场都是除了瓜果蔬菜、海鲜鱼肉之外，会有很多小餐馆现做美食，食客可以坐下狂吃，就像亚洲商场里的food court，只是类似多数西餐，大多寡淡无味。 无论如何，我还是很想念很想念智利的牛油果牛油果的，看看下图就知道了，简直无处不在，新鲜好吃还便宜！跟西北欧这些超市里卖的干硬无味的表弟们完全不可同日而语。就像当地人一样，几乎每顿都会甩开膀子吃个够。还有还有，大樱桃、大草莓、番荔枝(释迦果)、蛋黄果、马基莓果。。。。。。好饿，写不下去了。。。 .jpg) .jpg) .jpg) .JPG) .jpg) ##So that’s it for today. Hope you like these snapshots! As you can see, it’s only the first post about this city, so much more are coming. Stay tuned and see you soon! :) 那好，今天的第一集随拍就先到这里。还有太多照片要分享，下次见！=) ## Here are some more COLOURFUL posts I did about Latin America earlier (still updating this list):这里有一些以前发的多彩拉美： BRAZIL:Colorful Olinda &amp; San JuanNiemeyer’s Artwork Through My Lens (1) BOLIVIA:Flamingos PERU:Traditional Clothing in Peru’s Colca CanyonTrekking in Rainbow Mountains in Peru ARGENTINA:Colorful CaminitoHike with Me in El Chaltén (1) CHILE:Reach Torres del Paine in a Different Way!Follow Me to Grey Glacier (1) Follow Me to Grey Glacier (2) Explore Easter Island with Me (1) - Introduction and AnakenaExplore Easter Island with Me (2) - Best Sunset Spot Ahu Akivi COLOMBIA:Exploring Comuna 13 of MedellínColombian Coffee Triangle’s Fun Vehicle - Willys Jeep CUBA:The Wild Cuban Beach and Dying Mangroves PUERTO RICO:An Abandoned Boat on the Island of Vieques …… All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for visiting!

This is the final call to join【Cross-culture Challenge】. Many Steemians have entered their amazing posts or comments in the past few weeks, and you still have 4 days left to join the fun! =) The deadline for submitting your entry is the last minute of Feb 10th Brussels time zone (Central European Standard Time - GMT+1). ##Feb 7th is my birthday (already so in China but still 6 hours left here in Europe), so I’d like to talk a bit about the birthday celebrations in my home country and in a few countries I lived. The celebrations surely vary with different families or individuals even in the same country. I’m only comapring based on my personal experiences. In China, lots of young people celebrate their birthdays by eating in a restaurant and/or singing in a Karaoke with friends. While in some Western coutries, restaurants are kind of expensive and different from the numerous eateries in Asia (the same level of food quality and service you usually pay much less in China), so many of my Western friends and classmates choose to throw a party at home offering snacks and drinks. I’ve seen as well young people celebrating in fast food places like McDonald’s. Sometimes the group go to a bar or do bar hopping to keep on drinking, chatting and dancing. In Puerto Rico and other Latin parties I experienced, the drinking and dancing part takes a vital role. Many Latins seem to be born with a dancing talent, while most of my Asian friends prefer to sing in a confined Karaoke box… ;) While I lived in Chile and Australia, BBQ is also a popular way to celebrate birthday. In every apartment and house I rent in these 2 countries, there’s a dedicated part for BBQ, normally in the backyard of the house or on top floor of the apartment building. I really enjoyed this way of meeting up with friends too. =) ##Of course, there are also Chinese celebrating at home and Westerners getting together in restaurants, it’s just I can’t cover each individual case. What about you? How do you normally celebrate birthday? Tell me in the comments please! :) 各位新年好~ 这是最后一次召集大家参加【跨文化活动】！这些天有很多朋友参与留言或发帖，比较了他们所经历或听闻的文化差异，非常有意思。如果你有兴趣，还有四天时间准备。最后期限是中欧时间2月10号的最后一秒（比北京时间晚7小时）。 ##2月7号是我的生日，北京时间已经到了，但欧洲这边还差6个小时。所以我来聊聊自己所经历的各文化中庆祝生日的不同。当然，别说各国，就算同一个地方的不同家庭或个人庆祝生日的方式也不会都一样。我只能从个人的有限经历来比较一下喽~ 我在中国呆过的地方都在江南，很多年轻人比较喜欢请朋友去下馆子大吃一顿，然后可能去唱K或者蹦迪、压马路之类。 而西欧国家同等的餐馆大都比较贵，还能安静出个鸟来，各种礼仪讲究，有点拘谨，庆生也没什么气氛（拉丁国家又不一样，多次亲见一桌人把整个饭店变成载歌载舞的欢乐海洋）。所以常见到些年轻人在类似麦当劳这样的快餐店里庆祝，也有不少朋友在家办生日趴，准备些零食酒水，一群人或站或坐，或熟或生的人群/食物，端着杯酒水，各种神聊或尬聊。 然后在波多黎各等很拉丁的国家，生日趴上的喝酒和跳舞又被上升到了一个新高度。拉丁人种仿佛生来一副水蛇腰，几岁的小孩子跳舞也超有韵律感，而不少东亚人似乎更喜欢默默地躲在卡拉OK的包间里引吭高歌。。。 住在智利和澳洲时，烧烤也是很受欢迎的庆生方式。所有租住过的公寓和平房里都有配备BBQ场地和器材。前者在公寓楼的顶层会配有几个烤架、空间等给居民共用，后者一般在后院里。缕缕轻烟中，串串小食翻转烘烤着，三五好友，相聚欢谈，个人觉得这比喝酒吃冷盘要惬意许多咯~ 那你呢？你们那里一般是怎么庆祝生日的？欢迎留言告诉我~  ##So why a cross-culture challenge? ❓ Like I said in my intro post: I’m most enthusiastic about traveling, photography, cooking, art… I believe any traveler understands this wanderlust - you just can’t have enough. By traveling far and wide, you discover new ways of living and understand other cultures to appreciate them, you constantly get inspired and would ultimately better yourself. Especially when you travel solo, you set yourself free and interact more with locals. You start to judge less and accept more.…I do, like many of you foodies there, take great pleasure in eating and cooking. And I try to learn cooking from different cultures during my travels, to spice up my own experiments on food fusion… ##There is a great variety of cultures on this planet, and each culture has its own charm. Lived across 5 continets and traveled to over 60 countries, I have been mesmerised by all the different cultures. Steemians here come from all over the world with rich cultural backgrounds. It would be fun to exchange some ideas/photos/videos… Exchange makes change. Live and let live. So my challenge will focus on “cross-culture”. To join this challenge, you just need to compare 2 or more cultures that you have experienced. Any form of content is welcome, you can write a short essay, post a photo story, create a drawing/painting/animation/design, share a quick video, record your voice of talking or singing… all fine! It would be great to hear your personal stories soaking up in different cultures.

It’s raining, raining and raining most of the time. The dark clouds were hanging low, and the strong waves crushed onto the rocky shores in the crazy heavy wind. Used to the clear tranquil water of the Mediterranean Sea, this turbulent scene was quite unexpected. ##大家新年好！ 献上来自意大利撒丁岛的汹涌祝福～ 祝年吃饱睡好没烦恼！ Chinese New Year and Spring Festival##In China, most working people will have a week holiday around the New Year, starting from New Year’s Eve or a bit earlier. This holiday is normally called Golden Week Holiday of Spring Festival. Just like the Christmas holiday for westerners, Spring Festival is of great importance for Chinese family reunions. So why does the 2019 Chinese New Year land on February 5th instead of January 1st? It is because the Spring Festival in China is based on the lunar calendar, which is decided by the monthly cycles of the Moon’s phases, also known as synodic months. As a result, the Chinese New Year has no exact date each year, but it mostly falls on a day in January or February in Gregorian calendar, roughly the same dates of Aquarius sign in the Western Zodiac. Actually, there’s also a Chinese Valentine’s Day(Qixi/Qiqiao Festival) originated from a beautiful romantic legend, which falls on the 7th day of the 7th month on the Chinese lunar calendar, so it’s usually some day in July or August in Gregorian Calendar. And a fun fact: my birthday is February 7th, which always fell somewhere close to the Chinese New Year. :) As you may know, 2019 is the year of Pig. If you are interested in the Chinese Zodiac culture, check out this post I did last year. =) ##Last year I was in Australia during the Spring Festival, also by the sea. Here are the greeting cards I made from the photo I took of The Twelve Apostles: 想起去年此时在澳洲过春节，也是在海边，拍了大洋路上有名的12门徒岩(其实只剩8个;p)做成贺卡： ## ## ## This is also my entry to the Photo Friday competition by @qurator.

Today is my birthday!  It’s irrelevant to this post though. ;) I’m going for dinner after this and will possibly post about the food another day if I don’t get too lazy. The head image is my entry for the #TravelPhotoContest by @lightcaptured. The theme of this week is Black &amp; White. I shot this photo from a train when traveling through Tea Country in central Sri Lanka.  It was raining harder and harder. I sticked my head out the window and saw another traveler hanging out in the rain. The view looked pretty cool, so I captured that moment. When you visit Sri Lanka, taking the trains  is definitely something you shouldn’t miss. It’s an inexpensive way to get around, and the trains are going through beautiful scenic area, packed with fun cultural experiences as well. ##The initial railway system was built by the British in 1864, mainly to transport tea and coffee from the Tea Country to the capital port city Colombo, so that the produce can be shipped internationally. Today there are train tracks between major towns in Sri Lanka. The coastal train ride from Colombo to Dutch colonial Galle is also popular among tourists and locals alike. In the following photo I took at the Marine Drive of Colombo, you can see the train rails. This running train was probably going to Galle or somewhere in between along the coast. https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdRtTHfSz2PmHEQtrnnfG28CABMiQSQnL5Efdz6QoM1mF/sritraincolombobw.JPG The black &amp; white photos are also my entries to @daveks’ #bwphotocontest themed “Planes, Trains and Automobiles”.

I found it’s fun and got to know some Steem friends better after reading their answers. Earlier today I watched the challenge video of @livinguktaiwan, and realized I still haven’t joined it! So here it is: ##1. What supernatural power would you want to have? Be able to fly and to turn objects edible.  ##2. If you could choose your birth place, where will it be, and why? Mars. They say “Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus”, so I’d like to try out a different world.  ##3. If you could go back in time to meet someone from the past, who will it be and why? Leonardo da Vinci. He’s a cool combination of scientist and artist. I have to learn some ancient Italian first though.  ##4. Which childhood memory is your favorite? Found lots of money notes rolled in a tin can hidden in a tree hole when playing with my cousin. We bought a hill of snacks with that money.  ##5. What are the three things you notice in the opposite sex first? eyes, nose and mouth (if we are sitting)nosetril, chin and beard (if we are standing)hair, hands and shoes (the more sensual movielike ostentatious answer) ##6. If Life was a music, what song will yours be playing ? Bobby McFerrin - Don’t Worry Be Happy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-diB65scQU ##7. If you were arrested with no explanation, what would your friends and family assume you had done? Ate too much in a restaurant and forgot to bring cash/card/Wechat/Alipay with me. Or some powerful official was offended by my bad joke. ##8. In one sentence, how would you sum up the whaleshares platform? Good marketing if you guys created this challenge. ;) Seriously, I can’t even find enough time for this platform, not to say a 2nd one. Anyone who tried it out? I’d love to see your answers! ##9. What’s the funniest Wi-Fi name you’ve seen? 123abc ##10. What’s something your brain tries to make you do and you have to will yourself not to do it? Sleeping in the morning.

As you may know, people in China and ethnic Chinese around the world have been celebrating the New Year of the Pig since a few days ago. To go with the flow and to join @christinelook’s contest of presenting red packets, I just made a red packet from scratch. (Thanks @fruityexplorer and @jenina619 for tagging me! =)) And it’s definitely part of my #beautifulsunday (by @ace108) and #sublimesunday (by @c0ff33a)! :) ##今天是初六，大家继续新年好！ 感谢@fruityexplorer和@jenina619提醒我参加@christinelook的晒红包活动。因为已经长大好多年，没有红包拿，这里也不像巴黎伦敦旧金山温哥华之类的城市有那么多华人，没什么过年气氛。所以我就自己来做一个红包吧！ 请看具体步骤： ##Here’s the breakdown: ##Prepare a piece of red cardstock:裁一张红色薄卡纸： ##Cut it out, fold and glue it into a packet:剪、折、固体胶粘合： ##Since it’s the Pig Year, I draw a cartoon pig face at the back and cut the shape out:背面封口画上猪头，按外形剪一下： ##I write down the Chinese character of SPRING in front with a typical brush for calligraphy, but I don’t have Chinese ink at home, so I use the black metallic paint instead. It’s not as smooth, but it’s shining which is pretty cool and festive. :) I feel this type of paint is suitable for making greeting cards (like what I did when DIYing the Christmas card), and red packets are similar to greeting cards in terms of their function and medium, aren’t they? ##我小手一挥，在红包正面写下个“春”字，因为春节、春回大地嘛，总不能写个“猪”字吧~  因为家里没有墨水，就用黑色闪光涂料代替了。虽然没那么丝滑好运笔，比较干涩，但有一种bling bling的效果，简直亮瞎眼~ 想想上次DIY圣诞贺卡也是用的这种涂料，反正红包和贺卡不是差不多的东西吗？一个供写字，一个供装钱+写字。。。 正面没写“猪”，那反面画只猪头好了。我看着猪鼻子突出的地方，突然想到个不错的办法。就是用刀在下面的纸上刻一条缝，这样把猪鼻子插进去就算给红包封口了。但是鼻子进去后，会有一截被红纸挡住，所以我又沿着那道弧线画了张嘴，这样不管插不插入，看着都不会奇怪。我是不是有点机智？ ##Make a cut for the “pig nose” to get in, so the packet can be sealed after the bank notes are put in: ## ##That’s it! 完成！ ##What do you think of my handmade red packet?

This is my entry for the VALENTINE’S DAY PHOTO CONTEST 2019 by @flamingirl. I post 3 photos from different angles as proof that they are my photoworks. More details can be provided if necessary. ## ##Here’s a bit history and legend about roses. Earliest roses are known to have grown 35 million-years ago, and from ancient Egyptian tombs, petrified rose wreaths have been unearthed. In Greek mythology, Aphrodite, Goddess of Love, is said to have created the rose. According to the poet Anacreon, sea foam dripping from her newborn body turned into white roses; thus symbolizing her innocence and purity. Later, her wounded lover Adonis’ blood was shed onto a white rose, and the red rose represented her desire and passion. The Romans, with their counterpart Goddess of Love - Venus, also adopted the rose as a symbol of love and beauty. Cupid offered a rose to bribe the God of Silence to hush his mother Venus’s affairs. And when he shot arrows at bees which had stung him, thorns grew from the rose stems where the bees were missed. There’s even The War of the Roses. In this civil war in England in the 15th century, the House of York adopted a white rose, while the House of Lancaster chose a red rose. At last, the winner - Tudor Henry VII created the Tudor Rose by merging his Lancastrian rose with the red rose of his York bride. This Rose is also known as the Rose of England. ##My previous photos of roses: https://steemitimages.com/DQmUyKXEpGvGVtM2KGEeoMFvwf4LJM5ugPcxhbGGxLxQ1pB/IMG_7777rose.JPGhttps://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmShi8x6o3ZiBCohGF32XLJpQA5YdJ4Qj3YGuL8HLQ2AwS/106177A4-551D-4EE2-BD51-DE4A2FE09931.jpeg ##张爱玲奶奶70多年前在她的小说《红玫瑰与白玫瑰》中留下了这段名言： 也许每一个男子全都有过这样的两个女人，至少两个。娶了红玫瑰，久而久之，红的变了墙上的一抹蚊子血，白的还是“床前明月光”。娶了白玫瑰，白的便是衣服上沾的一粒饭黏子，红的却是心口上一颗朱砂痣。 小说里，热烈的红玫瑰最终转变为贤慧的他人妻，圣洁的白玫瑰却苍凉地失去了自我。哪个更好？哪个更合适？何止婚姻是围城，这世上又有什么重大决定不是呢？ All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for visiting!

So I went there recently again and again, on my birthday and on Valentine’s Day too! =) 今天推荐一家比利时去年新开的川菜馆，自从发现这个超赞的地方，几乎每周都要去一次，前些天生日又去吃了，情人节又双去吃了，今天又双叒去吃了。。。:D ## ##Szechuan (“Sichuan” in Mandarin Pinyin) cuisine originates from Sichuan Province of Southwest China. It’s known for its bold pungent spicy flavours, resulting from liberal use of garlic and chili peppers, as well as the numb-your-tongue Sichuan peppercorn (Huajiao) ;). Since most early Chinese immigrants overseas are from the coastal provinces like Canton and Fujian, a large amount of old Chinese restaurants out of China serve dishes from these parts. A few of them are genuine with subtle flavors, most are westernized usually with sweet and sour sauce or covered by soy sauce, which is pretty strange to the Chinese eaters. I’ve probably explained 1000 times to my international friends that Cantonese cuisine is only a small part of Chinese cuisine, and even much of the Cantonese cuisine we get out of China is not so authentic. ;) So when I discovered this Sichuan restaurant in a small town in Belgium, I felt exhilarated. Yes, the immense joy of devouring genuine tasty Chinese food! :D 川菜大家可能都熟悉，多年前就已经火遍全国，在海外华人聚居区也不难看到，只是在比利时这样的小地方并不常见。因为早期的老移民餐馆多为迎合西方口味改良的非正宗粤菜，而真正能做出粤菜鲜香爽滑嫩口味的不多，造成很多没去过中国的国际友人的误解，说到中国菜，就以为是那种类似咕噜肉的酸甜系，或者酱油包揽一切的一团可怕黑糊。。。&gt;_&lt; 我在世界各地被吐槽多次，每次都要苦口婆心解释一番。别说中国这么多不同的菜系，只是其中的粤菜就包括广州菜、潮州菜、东江菜/梅州菜这些不同的地方风味，主料之广泛丰富、配料之精细讲究，几天几夜都讲不完啊。还好去年新开了一家“当代”风格的川菜馆，除了鲜香麻辣的川菜，也照顾到当地人的口味，有北京烤鸭、广式日式韩式的一些菜品和小点心，很棒，可以常去解解馋。=) ## The Pig Year of 2019:可爱的猪年小装饰：.JPG) ##This restaurant is located in the countryside with ample parking space. It has 2 seperate rooms. Small but cosy. When I first visited it last year, it was still quite empty, but after a few times, this hidden gem has obviously been discovered - it’s getting packed nowadays. And you see Chinese eaters here each time - always a great sign! :) ## ##The sweet girl at the reception told me her brother is the chef, and she’s responsible for the rest. At first, we saw each other as “a young girl”, but later it turned out we are both 30 something and she is already a mother of 2! Ok, thanks to the forever young Asian gene… ;) She moved to Belgium from Sichuan over a decade ago to join her brother who came here earlier. I would soon witness all their magic - her pretty interior decor and her brother’s excellent cooking. ## ##They have 3 menus - for delivery, for Chinese eaters and for local customers:成功中餐馆的菜单标配 —— 外卖单、中文单、本地人单： ##Since I was here many times with quite a lot of photos, I will leave the drinks part to the next post. So today I’m only showing you some food pictures I took, like this famous Sichuan Dry Fried Long Beans (干煸四季豆). It’s like Peking Duck and dumplings - always a safe choice. No matter Chinese or not - everyone loves them. =) ##Beef with ginger and pickled peppers（仔姜泡椒牛肉丝）: ##Spicy chicken in an iron wok (干锅鸡) : ##这里贴出的是我几次去这家餐馆吃时拍的照片们。关于川菜，我吃了不少，但系统了解不多，所以从维基百科上摘录抄袭了几段学习一下，欢迎川菜行家留言补充~ 古典川菜的出现可追溯至秦汉，在宋代已经形成流派，当时的影响范围主要是中原。花椒原生于中国秦蜀等地，《神农本草经》载有秦椒及蜀椒。明末清初，辣椒由美洲经欧洲引入中国，到清朝中期，中国菜确定主要调味剂——辣椒和蔗糖的运用。川菜也开始用上辣椒调味，遂形成以麻辣味为主的料理方式，现代意义上的川菜开始成形。 川菜以成都和重庆两地的菜肴为代表。所用的调味品有花椒、胡椒、辣椒，合称“三椒”；葱、姜、蒜，合称“三香”；以及郫县豆瓣酱、永川豆豉等亦使用频繁，以调味为重点的有“鱼香”、“怪味”等菜。川菜的风格朴实而又清新，官家川菜精细别致，农家川菜具浓厚的乡土气息。川菜有“七滋八味”之说，“七滋”指甜、酸、麻、辣、苦、香、咸；“八味”即是鱼香、酸辣、椒麻、怪味、麻辣、红油、姜汁、家常。 在烹调方法上常用炒、滑、熘、爆、煸、炸、煮、煨等，尤为小煎、小炒、干煸和干烧有极具特色。 蓉菜或蓉派川菜，以成都菜式为主，此派菜式精致细腻，多为流传久远的传统川菜，其味温和，绵香悠长；渝菜或渝派川菜，以重庆菜式为主，此派菜式大方粗犷，以花样翻新迅速、用料大胆、不拘泥于材料著称称，俗称江湖菜；盐帮菜或自贡菜，是以自贡为中心的川南菜色的统称，还涵盖了宜宾、内江和泸州。自贡盐帮菜又分为盐商菜、盐工菜、会馆菜三大支系，以麻辣味、辛辣味、甜酸味为三大类别。以精致、奢华、怪异、麻辣、鲜香、鲜嫩味浓为特色。 川菜的代表菜有：宫保鸡丁、干烧鱼、回锅肉、麻婆豆腐、家常豆腐、黄焖鸭、夫妻肺片、盐水鸭、锅巴肉片、合川肉片、江津肉片、樟茶鸭子、干煸牛肉丝、怪味鸡块、灯影牛肉、鱼香肉丝、水煮牛肉，水煮肉片等。不辣的名菜有东坡肘子、黄焖鸭、锅巴肉片、合川肉片、江津肉片、黄烧鱼翅、白汁鱼唇、清汤鱿鱼方、清蒸元鱼、烤乳猪等。 在川菜中，高钠问题屡见不鲜。川菜的普遍菜式因浓郁，厚重口味的需要，加入类似郫县豆瓣等钠含量极高的调味料。在一些质量不佳的四川泡菜中，更会含有亚硝酸盐，过多食用对身体健康会产生严重影响。 ##At last, a few more photo collages of the food I tried in this resraurant. Most of them are typical Sichuan style, like the vegetables and meat swimming in red oil ;p (四川冒菜), spicy Mapo tofu (麻婆豆腐), Dandan noodles（担担面）, fish with pickled cabbage (酸菜鱼), shredded pork with garlic sauce (鱼香肉丝)，clear noodles in chili sauce（川北凉粉）… A few are not from Sichuan province but too popular among locals as well as Chinese :), such as the Dim Sum, gyoza and Peking Duck: ##So that’s it about this lovely restaurant. Hope you enjoy it like I did! =) Next time I’ll talk about the different types of tea here. ##I’ll definitely recommend it to you, for its authentic Sichuan food as well as not-so-firy dishes ;), for its friendly and fast service, and for its light music and cosy atmosphere. It’s also good value for money - about 20 to 30 euros per person, you get such great food and drinks, every time. The only thing is it’s not easy to reach by public transportation, but because of this, you can dine in a more quiet and peaceful setting, once you make it there. :) ##好了，这家餐馆就介绍到这里，你觉得怎么样？我很喜欢，强烈推荐~ 如果你来比利时，吃够了西餐薯条巧克力，可以来这里换换口味 :)。好吃不贵、环境幽雅、上菜超快，兄妹俩友好和善，哥哥是大厨，妹妹接待客人跑堂。唯一的问题可能是公共交通不便到达，但也正是因为在郊区，所以停车方便、自在悠闲。 .jpg) All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for visiting!

It’s also joining the Qurator Photo Friday competition. As you can see, the concept is quite simple and straightforward: “LOVE” made by a lipstick, a donut and cut rose petals. :) Here are the components I got (everything started from the lovely donuts in a supermarket on Valentine’s Day ;p): .JPG) .jpg) ##So I first put the sweet donut covered with little “hearts” on a piece of pink cardstock, and used a red lipstick to write down the letters “L” and “V”. Then I cut a rose petal into 4 stripes to make a letter “E”. At last, shoot it with my phone. That’s it! Easy peasy lemon squeezy! ;) .JPG) .JPG) These are the original colors.

You probably got it right - in the Netherlands! I shot this photo in the famous windmill village of Kinderdijk, close to Rotterdam. This place is best known for its 19 iconic windmills built in the first half of 18th century. I arrived in the afternoon and wandered around until sunset. By that time everything was closed, so it was quiet and peaceful. This waterway and the windmills were bathing in warm golden rays. Amazing serenity! Hope you enjoy this view as I did! =) This is my entry for the photo contest by @ntopaz. It’s cropped as 16:9, so here’s my orginal photo, and last year I posted another b&amp;w photo of a windmill from the same place: ## ##Hi~ 能猜出我这张照片是在哪里拍的吗？没错，在风车之国 —— 荷兰！这个蛮有名的小孩堤坝风车村位于鹿特丹东南10公里处，保存着19架建于18世纪40年代的风车，已被列入世界遗产名录。 难得碰上阳光灿烂的好天气，四处逛了下，等到傍晚时，景点结束营业，游客们陆续离去，整个村子一片安宁静谧。风车和周边的房子，还有运河边的水草都静静地倒映在水中，被夕阳的金辉轻柔地裹上一层暖暖的外衣。 题图这张用来参加@ntopaz的风光摄影活动，发布时被截成16：9，所以也发张原图。去年我曾发过一张同一地点拍的黑白风车倒影（最后一张）。 All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多Camera/Lens: Canon EOS Kiss X3 / 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USMISO 100 / 1/60 / f8 / 15mm Thank you for visiting!

OnePageX.com has over 140 cryptocurrencies listed. Besides, STEEM has been integrated as a base asset. It means that you can convert STEEM to any of the 140+ cryptocurrencies instantly! Great news for Steemians right? :) ##If you have a website where you want to offer your visitors an altcoin converter, you can also try the OneBox. It is easy to implement with a copy-paste of some code. The user never leaves your website, as everything happens inside the widget. My Post-Design ;) Brief: ##After exploring their website and relevant info, I decided to make an infographic to show the step-by-step instructions on how to use OnePageX.com. Based on my marketing experience, this type of simple chart with how-to steps is nice and handy to share on social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest… and of course the blockchain social platforms! =) ##I first picked the background color from their website to apply as the canvas color for my infographic chart. To be in line with their site’s minimal style and the brand colors, I limited the chart’s colors into green, white and blue. And I put their logo and homepage picture in the up middle of the chart. For the screenshot, I chose Steem (Of course! Also its color is still in the blue family of the background color, though it’s quite a distant relative… ;p) and BCHAB (mainly because of its green and white logo) as an exchange example. I threw in their catchy taglines and the website address (Traffic! Traffic! Traffic! ) too. Then I summarised the 3 steps to use the site and visualized them with some icons. That’s it! Easy peasy lemon squeezy~ :) ##My final design: ## What do you think of my design?

Today I’m sharing the amazing view I captured from Zugspitzblick. It’s near the Fernpass in Austria, close to the border with Germany. As its name Zugspitzblick suggests, this is a great point to enjoy the view of the Zugspitze peak. Standing at 2,962 m above sea level, the Zugspitze is the highest peak in Germany. The border between Austria and Germany runs over its western summit. The green lake you see here is Blindsee. With a visibility of about 30 m, its deep clear water and rich varieties of fish have attracted many divers. Mother nature never fails to impress me, and words always fail me when I face this kind of beauty. :) So just have a look at my photo. Hope you enjoy this view from the Alps like I did! This is my entry for the European Thursday Photo Challenge and @qurator’s Photo Friday competition. ##今天分享一张我在奥地利蒂罗尔州楚格峰山区的手机摄影。照片里的山是德国最高峰 —— 楚格峰，海拔2962米，属于阿尔卑斯山脉。 这山位于德国巴伐利亚州，在奥地利边境附近。这湖叫Blindsee，海拔1093米。湖水很清澈，水下30米可见，是由一个巨大的石体滑坡在4100年前形成的。据说湖里鱼类品种丰富，所以吸引了许多潜水员前来体验。我就这样远远地看着，已经不由对大自然老母亲心生敬畏，以后如果有机会，也想下水去跟这湖里的鱼儿们打个招呼~ :) All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多photo shot with iPhone 7 Thank you for visiting!

It’s also my entry to join the 50th edition of the @STEEMFoodTours challenge by @jeffjagoe. Check it out and join the fun if you are a foodie too! :) As the restaurant’s name suggests, it’s focusing on different types of sushi. But since it’s a raining and chilly night here in Belgium, I didn’t feel like eating cold sushi. Instead, I ordered a plate of stir-fried rice and a cup of heart-warming tea. The food here is not top-notch, but pretty tasty. The dishes they serve are kind of Asian food fusion, like many other Asian eateries in Western countries, to cater to both locals as well as eaters from other countries. The staff is very friendly and their service is fast. But their square tables are a bit too tiny for all the food and drinks, especially when it’s a huge portion. I’m not a big fan of their decor - too much red everywhere which makes me feel dizzy, haha. ## ## The mint tea(water) is fresh and not so sweet as the traditional Moroccan mint tea I tried, because there’s no sugar in it but aside. The picture is also my entry to the new challenge - “Tea Time” in CN community, hosted by @aellly and @xiaoshancun. ##这是我今天的晚饭：虾仁蔬菜炒饭和薄荷茶。下面这张薄荷茶的照片参加@aellly和@xiaoshancun主办的【星期一喝茶】#3，这周是第三期，有兴趣的小伙伴一起来玩吧！ ## All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 ##Posted using Partiko iOS Thank you for visiting!

Today I’m sharing some photos of reflections in water. The monochrome ones also serve as my entries for the B&amp;W Photo Contest hosted by @daveks. ##The first entry is from the Austrian Alps in the beautiful region of Tyrol. I’ve loved this area - you can enjoy breathtaking views almost everywhere after some easy hikes, and it’s normally less crowded and expensive than in similar places of Swiss or French Alps. I took these 2 photos by the lake of Klammsee in the Kaprun ski area. The water of these alpine lakes is usually very clear, so reflections are common sights here. :) ## ## ## Reflections of Boat Lifts and Trees | Wallonia, Belgium比利时瓦隆区运河中的起船台倒影 ## ##This is an Ascenseur (hydraulic boat lift) located on the Ancien Canal Du Centre near La Louvière of Belgium. 4 lifts with 15+ meters rise were built in the late 19th and early 20th century, and this place has been designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The lifts were used to overcome the difference of the water level (a rise by 66.2 meters) along the canal. You can see all the 4 boat lifts here if interested. This region used to be an important industrial belt in the country, but nowadays commercial traffic bypasses these old lifts and is handled by the huge Strépy-Thieu boat lift, which was the highest in the world upon completion, with a rise of 73 meters. I arrived here at sunset and got to see this engineering marvel standing quietly with his reflection in the canal. That sense of past glory! ;) ## ## Reflections of Windmills | Kinderdijk, The Netherlands荷兰风车村水道中的倒影 ## ##I shot this photo in the windmill village of Kinderdijk, close to Rotterdam. This place is best known for its 19 iconic windmills built in the first half of 18th century. I arrived in the afternoon and wandered around till the golden hour. By that time everything was closed and most visitors left, so the windmills and plants were bathing peacefully in warm rays by the waterway. I used to post photos from the same village but from different angles. ## ##So that’s it for my reflection shots. Which is your favorite one? Tell me in the comments please. =) ##今天分享的是我在欧洲三处拍的几张倒影的照片，你最喜欢哪一张呢？ All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多Photos shot with iPhone 7 &amp; Canon Kiss X3 Thank you for visiting!

Binche carnival is an annual festival celebrating Shrove Tuesday (Mardi Gras) during the three days before Lent. Since today is Ash Wednesday, this year’s celebrations just took place the past 3 days. So I’m very excited to share my festive experience with you! :D I only visited Binche on one of the three days a few years ago, and it was a lot of fun, despite the cold and wet weather. This tradition dates back to around the 14th century and has been recognized as UNESCO heritage. During the carnival each year, over a thousand local males and children dress up as several figures to perform in medieval parade. ## ##嗨~ 受到SteemitBoard和Wherein节日分享活动的启发，今天就请跟我到比利时的班什感受一下一年一度的狂欢节。 最近是狂欢节高发期，你可能听过意大利威尼斯的狂欢节，欧洲的四大狂欢节还有三个分别在法国尼斯，德国科隆和比利时南部法语区的这个中世纪小古城 —— 班什。真是难得，这么低调的国家竟然光荣跻身Top 4! 我来比利时之前完全不知道这个地方的存在和它每年一次的狂欢节。 今年班什的庆祝就在刚刚过去的这三天！因为今天是圣灰星期三，教会举行涂灰礼，把去年祝圣过的棕枝烧成灰涂在教友的额头上，象征悔改。这是大斋期的第一天，而很多嘉年华的由来就是大斋开始前的最后狂欢放纵，也是辞旧岁迎新春。 比利时的这个也是历史悠久，据说可以追溯到14世纪（然鹅百度百科说是“1554年罗马帝国皇帝的妹妹玛利亚在班什造城池、建宫殿，为欢迎外甥菲利普二世举行盛大宴会，宫廷官员于是化装成各种达官贵人参加宴会。”），已经被联合国教科文组织认定为人类口述和非物质遗产。刚查了下，中国在这名录上的有昆曲、古琴、新疆维吾尔的木卡姆艺术和蒙古族的长调民歌。 当地居民对这个古老的传统深感自豪，自发参与游行，让随着狂欢节保留下来的音乐、舞蹈、服饰、道具制作等得以代代相传。那些连续50年扮装成吉勒的居民还会被市长授予纪念奖章。我几年前去凑了下热闹，在二月，虽然一贯的寒冷阴沉，也没有拉丁族群那种狂热的气氛，但还是很欢乐地。:D ##Decorations on local windows: 当地窗上的节日装饰： .JPG) .JPG) ##First, I saw some kids marching through the streets. The main figures in the proceedings are called Gilles. They wear clown-like costumes with bells, and their unique clogs don’t look so easy to walk with. Some of them wear large hats adorned with fluffy ostrich plumes. It’s said that local men see being a Gille at the carnival as a kind of honor. It’s cool that the residents here try to preserve this old tradition generation after generation. Actually, since I was a night owl, I missed the early morning parade of the carnival’s final day, when Gilles in wax masks (in the last photo) danced to drum beat and warded off evil spirits with sticks. 先是看到一些小孩出街游行。下面这种装束的是狂欢节的核心角色 —— 吉勒。他们身穿类似小丑的服装，配有铃铛，脚踏看上去有些笨重的木屐，有些头戴超大的驼鸟毛帽子，特色鲜明： .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) ##Another 3 groups in different colorful costumes: 还有其他三组身着各色服装的小孩子，有几个真是太萌了： .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) ##These ostrich plumes decorated hats are very finely made, costing about 200 euros to rent: 这些驼鸟羽毛帽做工精致，价值不菲，据说要花200欧左右才能租到一顶： .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) ##They carry a basket full of oranges and throw them to the crowds while marching. The oranges from Gilles are considered gifts with good luck, so we all try to catch the flying fruits from the middle of the street when standing at the side: 游行角色们手提篮子，在激昂的奏乐中不断向观众扔橘子，据说接到这些橘子代表会交好运，所以我们这些吃瓜群众就在街道两边各种疯狂争抢，哈哈： .JPG) .JPG) .JPG) %20(1).JPG) %20(2).JPG) %20(4).JPG) %20(3).JPG) ##A boy standing high: “I’m not tall enough, but I really want the oranges”: 个小不要紧，只要站得高： .JPG) ##Fishing oranges - works like a charm: 这个。。。是捞鱼的网吗？;) .JPG) ##And they go the extra mile - making it into heart shape with their website on it: 这个更厉害 —— 做成心形不过瘾，还要放上自己的网站打广告，哈哈哈： .JPG) ##Apparently locals have some advantages there - harvesting oranges easily with all kinds of nets. ;) But they also have to fence their windows, as there were properties damaged in the past by the orange bullets. 当地吃瓜居民近水楼台先得月~ :) 各种网篮齐出动，不用像我们这些外来人口一样拼命争抢，只要悠闲地接应几下，就可以确保橘子大丰收。当然也是有危险的，据说曾有很多窗户被砸坏，所以都做了防护栏： .JPG) ##The instrument also needs protection against flying oranges: 吹奏乐器的也准备了防护网，要不被四处飞的橘子堵住可就没的吹啦： .JPG) ##Poor oranges everywhere: 可怜的橘子们： .JPG) .JPG) ##“Hi, I have my own costume and drink~” 自娱自乐： .JPG) ##The little one is tired from all the marching and throwing oranges: 这位小吉勒估计累瘫了： .JPG) ##And a dinosaur: 还有小恐龙： .JPG) ##A flamenco dancer? :D Too cute! 这可爱的小女娃是来跳弗拉明戈的嘛？ .JPG) ##Unicorns of course: 嘉年华当然也少不了独角兽啦： .JPG) ##The end of the parade: 化装游行落幕 —— 留给你们一个孤独的背影。貌似晚上还有烟火和广场舞，但是一直在寒风中举着相机狂拍的我手都快冻僵了，觉得还是回家暖和一下才是正经事 &gt; &lt;： .JPG) ##Finally, 2 statues on the way to parking lot: 最后，去停车场路上看到的两尊嘉年华人物雕像： .JPG) .JPG) ##Here are my fruits of victory from the carnival. They are not the suitable type for eating directly though. 带着战利品回家，后来做成了果酱，因为这种橘子又苦又酸，不是一般人可以直接吞下的。。。 .JPG) So that’s it for this fun carnival. Have you been to a carnival?

That late afternoon, I was wandering around in town by Lake Titicaca, the world’s highest navigable body of water. Suddenly I discovered a narrow trail leading uphill, so I decided to explore where it would lead to. For some parts I had to use my hands to climb up the steep cliffs, and it’s not that easy to ascend in the very thin air. It turned out to be totally worthy - when I reached the hill top at sunset, the view was just breathtaking (quite literally too as I almost lost my breath ;p). The city’s colorful houses spreaded along the green hills, and the vast Lake Titicaca looked like an endless stretch of the deep blue sea. You might have heard of the world-renowned Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro? In fact, that more famous cousin takes its name from this town. :) In the local language Aymara, Copacabana means “view of the lake”, deriving from “kota kawana”. Later in Rio, people found the shape of their beach resembled the crescent one here in Bolivia (as you can see in my photos), so they called it the same name. ## ##The first photo is my entry to Qurator’s Photo Friday competition, and below is the location - you can get an idea of Lake Titicaca’s size: ##我从秘鲁陆路过境后，来到玻利维亚的边境小城科帕卡巴纳(Copacabana)。那天下午，独自在城内的的的喀喀湖边瞎逛，突然看到条上山的小路，决定探索一下。有些地方很陡，需要手脚并用地翻过山石，而且高原地带空气稀薄，等我好不容易爬到山顶，气都快没了。但看到的这番美景真是无法用语言形容，所以我就发了两张手机拍的照片^^。 在巴西时，去过里约热内卢那个世界闻名的海滩，也叫Copacabana，据说就是因为发现那里的海湾类似这儿的新月状，不知道这能不能叫墙里开花墙外香？结果里约的那片性感沙滩比这个高原山城的一弯新月要出名得多~。根据玻利维亚这里当地的语言，这个小城被叫做“湖景”(kota kawana)，看来我无意中发现的观景点竟然完全get到了此城的精华~ 真是太幸运了! :) Posted using Partiko iOS All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多Photos shot with iPhone 7 Thank you for visiting!

But I guess not every ramen restaurant has put this amount of time into it to get the real broth done, especially when it comes to some localized ones out of Japan. ##According to Seriouseats: You often see ramen categorized into four classes: shio (salt), shoyu (soy sauce), miso (fermented bean paste), and tonkotsu (pork), which doesn’t make particular sense, as the first three are flavorings, while the fourth is the broth base. ##To be honest, the soup of this ramen I ordered was not so rich as I expected, but it’s a full photogenic bowl, and I was grateful that I found this heartwarming tasty food in a frigid windy night.  .JPG) Address: .JPG) .JPG) ##More Foodie Posts:更多吃货帖： Cook with Donica - Make a Savory Crepe | 自制煎饼 A Szechuan Restaurant in Belgium  | 比利时正宗川菜馆推荐 Cooking Video: Creamy Garlic Scampi 戀 | 美味蒜香虾做法视频 Japanese Food Experience in a German Medieval Town   | 德国童话古镇的日餐推荐 Cook with Donica - Fish with Pickled Cabbage ‍ | 一起来做酸菜鱼 Cook with Donica - Braised Pork with Tofu and Shiitake  | 跟我做香菇豆腐红烧肉 Cook with Donica - Satay Fried Rice  | 来做简单美味的沙爹炒饭 Foodie’s Photo Journal of Sydney Fish Market  | 带你逛悉尼海鲜市场 Vietnamese Street Food - Mini-Pancakes丹  | 越南街头的迷你煎饼 Dirty Duck Restaurant in Ubud, Bali 閭  | 脏鸭馆的美食故事 Come Visit the Rotterdam Market Hall with Me 燎 | 号称全球颜值最高的菜市场长什么样？ All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多Photos shot with iPhone 7 Thank you for visiting!

The one you see in this post was shot at the street of its largest city Addis Ababa. I walked past a dozen construction sites and was on my way to Red Terror Martyrs Memorial Museum.

A warm shade was cast on the enormous overpass, vehicles, pedestrians and the shining wet ground. Heavy traffic, fumes and noises. I stopped at the red light. 2 Muslim ladies in headscarf were crossing the wide road in that perfect lighting.

It’s a bit over 1 hour by car from Santiago, and there are plenty of public buses connecting the 2 cities as well. Valparaíso boasts colorful houses along the hills and even more coloful graffiti all over the house walls. :) It’s called Chile’s Cultural Capital due to its booming art and culture scene. It’s great fun to take the steep funiculars to those hilltops, where you can visit the abundant beautiful architectures and artsy shops. Along your ride, you also get fantastic views of the buildings, the hills, the port and the vast Pacific ocean. ##瓦尔帕莱索是个多姿多彩、很有味道的嬉皮小城，被称为智利的“文化之都”。位于智利首都圣地亚哥以西的太平洋沿岸，从首都出发的话，自驾一个小时多一点，坐大巴近两个小时。这里跟大家分享的是我坐缆车上山后俯瞰到的港口景色。 ## ##In this post, I’m showing you the views of the port I got after ascending to high up by a funicular. Valparaíso’s port is divided into ten sites, and the last two include a dock and are used as public walks and cruise passenger terminal. As a main container and passenger port in the country, it transfers 10 million tons each year, and serves about 50 cruises. The city’s port received a large number of immigrants, primarily from Europe from 1848 till 1914. As a result, neighbourhoods of different styles were built on Valparaíso’s hillsides. Among these Historic Districts, the most prominant ones are legacies by the British, Germans, and Italians.

I guess I was too used to going to that beach every day, so didn’t feel like taking photos. :) 还有其他几处常去的城市海滩，竟然没有找到照片，大概是去太多习以为常了，就没有拍照。毕竟，熟悉的风景总是容易被忽略咯~ =) All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for visiting!

Phở?  Originated from northern Vietnam in the early 20th century, this delicious noodle soup has been popularized in other parts of the world by refugees after the Vietnam War. Well, Vietnamese people might laugt at it, since they surely have so much more to offer than this little bowl of noodle soup. But after trying out different food around Vietnam, I have to say phở is still one of my favorites.  ## Here I’m sharing some photos of the Phở bò (beef noodle soup) I had in Hanoi, the country’s capital. Since my friend Joy is traveling there right now and we talked about the local food. Phở consists of beef or chicken broth, herbs, and rice noodles called bánh phở. Phở bò is with beef cuts and Phở gà has chicken in it. When I was in Hanoi, I ate it almost any time of the day, but when I went to the south of Vietnam, it’s more difficult to find it after breakfast time. The size of the rice noodles, the choice of herbs and the taste of the broth are also different. ## ## ##因为老朋友Joy正在越南的首都河内游玩，问我以前在那吃了啥好吃的，我在手机里一通搜索，找到些河内逛吃的照片，这次先来分享个越南有名的河粉。 20世纪早期，越南河粉起源于国家的北部，也就是河内所在的那块地区。越南战争后被难民带到世界各地，广受欢迎。西方国家大城市的街头也常常能看到卖越南河粉的店。 当然，如果我们一提越南菜就说河粉，越南人估计会发笑，因为毕竟还有那么多其他美食呢。然鹅，我从北到南吃了一圈各种菜，还是觉得河粉最合胃口，哈哈…… 我这是烂泥扶不上墙的刘阿斗吗？ 一般越南河粉有鸡肉和牛肉两种口味，北方和南方用的米粉宽度、汤头味道和香草配料也有不同。我这里发的是在北方的河内一家小店吃到的牛肉河粉。在河内和其他北方地区时，一天到晚街头都有河粉卖，但后来到了南部，过了吃早餐的时间，就很难找到河粉摊子了。 ##Address:地址： This is my entry for Qurator’s Tasty Tuesday competition, and here are 2 more posts I did before about Vietnam: 另外，以前发过越南街头的迷你煎饼，还有在美国华盛顿和越南的胡志明市参观两个越南战争纪念馆的经历： Vietnamese Street Food - Mini-Pancakes丹  | 越南街头的迷你煎饼 https://steemitimages.com/DQmPU4sqvSZUrDHS3frjAbNGJ74UmN8u8B4gExDG4bA58uc/IMG_0708.JPG ## Visiting Vietnam Veterans Memorial  + War Remnants Museum  | 越南战争双馆记 https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQqZfP1qhWxohUbGh9xEjYt1fyHTSaE3BQ1cYwMfuqJya/IMG_6947.JPG All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for visiting!

You might have heard of Neuschwanstein Castle, which inspired Sleeping Beauty’s castle in Disneyland? So follow me today to visit this famous palace nestled in the idyllic Bavarian Alps! :) 大家好呀~ 你们听过德国的网红新天鹅堡吧？没错，就是迪士尼乐园里睡美人城堡的原型！据说也启发了1950年建成的灰姑娘城堡。今天就请跟我到巴伐利亚州，一路上山来看看这个梦幻城堡和它周围让人惊艳的自然环境。 ##As you can see from the map of my phone, the castle is located on a hill above the village of Hohenschwangau near Füssen in the southwest of Germany. Most visitors start the trip from Hohenschwangau where the ticket center is located. ##The route map I found on a road sign: ##Some easy walking at the beginning: ##En route I got this view of the castle - Hohenschwangau perched on a little hill, and the brilliant sunset. This older castle was where King Ludwig II spent his childhood, and it had been overshadowed by the shing new castle ever since its completion. ##Actually Neuschwanstein Castle was originally called New Hohenschwangau Castle, and it’s given a new name after Ludwig II’s death. Literally meaning “New Swan Stone Castle”, it is a reference to the influential and controversial composer Richard Wagner’s character, the Swan Night. King Ludwig II of Bavaria commissioned the castle as a retreat on a rugged cliff in 1868, 2 years after he lost his powers as a result of the Austro-Prussian War. However, he never saw the final Neuschwanstein castle. The last towers were only finished 6 years after his sudden death in 1886. After this charming Romanesque Revival palace was opened to the public, it quickly became one of the most visited castles in the world. Its white limestone façade and blue turrets are said to be real-life inspiration for the Disney Cinderella castle as well. ##Pictures and commentaries on my way - the castle seen from the west and the northwest: ##Getting closer: ##Looking up at the Neuschwanstein Castle: ##The tunnel inside: ##Below is the view I captured from the very high Marienbrücke” (Mary’s bridge), situated above Pöllat gorge. What impressed me the most was not the Neuschwanstein Castle itself, but rather how it blended into the stunning natural settings around. I visited it in September when the surrounding foliage just started to turn yellow, while green was still the dominant color. Judging from the photos I saw taken in other seasons, this place is amazingly beautiful all year round. I’d love to visit it in future in other times of the year and to do more hikings in the forests nearby. ##After crossing the bridge, I found a narrow trail leading high up. Thinking that it would be a great vantage point for photos, I decided to hike along: ##The trail was almost blocked at the end, and I had to climb with my hands at the last part. But it’s a lot of fun to explore, and it’s rewarding to see the panoramic view in the golden hour. :) ##View from that hilltop: The head image in this post was taken from the same vantage point, and it’s my entry to @qurator’s Photo Friday competition. So that’s it for today. Have you visited this world-renowned palace? How’s your experience?

You probably got it right - the Chicago Bean! This public artwork’s official name is Cloud Gate, and it has been a landmark of Chicago since the opening of Millennium Park in 2004. Locals call it The Bean. This huge magic bean is a very popular site that attracts tourists from around the world. I was one of them. :) It was during my grand solo trip in USA 5 years ago. I took the epic California Zephyr train (yes the unforgettable 53 hours crossing the vast American land with gorgeous views :)) from San Francisco to the Windy City - Chicago, and visited this famous stainless steel figure. ##嗨~ 大家好！看出来这是哪里了吗？这大豆一样的公共雕塑位于美国芝加哥的千禧公园，正式名称叫“云门”，昵称“豆荚”。自从2004年揭幕，就成为芝加哥的地标之一，一直吸引着世界各地的吃瓜群众前来观瞻，包括我。;) 五年前，我搭乘那趟有名的加州西风号列车，晃荡了50几个小时，横穿美国大陆，一路美景变幻，从春风萧萧的旧金山风尘仆仆地来到风城芝加哥，有幸领略了这颗大魔豆的风采。看出来这段的关键字是“风”了嘛？;p 它的创造者卡普尔是位印度裔的英国人，称云门的灵感来自于液态水银。这颗巨大的魔豆由168块不锈钢板接焊而成，我们这些游客可以从它的表面上看到被反射和扭曲的自己、其他吃瓜群众和城市轮廓。整个大豆光滑无接缝，底部的凹形空间还会歪曲和重叠影像，是不是很奇特？:) ## ##According to its creator, the Indian-born British artist Anish Kapoor: What I wanted to do was to make a work that would deal with the incredible skyline of Chicago and the open sky and the lake but then also be a kind of gate. You know, the tradition of public sculpture is for the gate, the archway, the square to flow within [the landscape] rather than be an object decorating it. Contemporary public spaces are a very difficult problem that we haven’t yet fully and properly understood. The idea here was to make a work that was drawing in the sky, the skyline and all of that, and at the same time allowing you to enter it like a piece of architecture that was pulling your own reflection into the fulcrum, making a kind of participatory experience. ## ##At every side of the big Bean, there were onlookers taking selfies or group photos. I guess we all like its lovely shape and the cool idea that one can see him/herself together with the surroundings from the shiny surface. Plus it’s fun to get those distorted shots of your body and the buildings around. =) Kudos to Anish Kapoor for the “participatory experience”! Like what we normally do on the Uyuni salt flats, or with the Pizza tower, visitors can take creative perspective photos with all kinds of goofy gestures. :D I would probably try some too if I travel there with my families or friends in future! ##Have you visited this Bean before? How’s your experience? The head image is also my entry for @axeman’s Cityscape Photo Contest.

It doesn’t require any programming skills, so it’s easy to use. Anyone can use GDevelop to create 2D games, such as platformers, puzzles, shoot ‘em up, strategy, 8-bit games… It can be simple projects for fun or more ambitious indie games. Events is a unique feature of GDevelop. It’s a powerful way to express the logic of your game without a programming language. Users can publish games created with GDevelop to the web, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux and even Facebook Messenger. Games can also be exported in one click to Android from the app. GDevelop also offers visual editors to prototype new features, and the game engine can be extended with Javascript. Tutorials, examples and a complete documentation for the software are available. As a wonderful opportunity to teach programming and game making, GDevelop has already been used in classrooms and online courses, with digital media students or children in first grade. ## Image Source: https://gdevelop-app.com ##Before I started the translation of GDevelop, I first read through the project on Crowdin and in GitHub. Except for the GDevelop 5 I’m translating, their website is to be translated. This project’s user-friendly and creative features interests me. I believe it’s a great tool that helps people without any programming knowledge turn their ideas into reality. Sounds exciting, doesn’t it? Hopefully my translation in Simplified Chinese bring more users to this platform. I’d love to see the large number of Chinese makers and educators benefit from this tool. So they can unleash their creativity to build games or programmes, and inspire students to do so as well. Contribution Specifications ##Translation Overview As you can see from the screenshots below, this project consists of 2 files - GDevelop 5 (editor) and GDevelop (core and extensions). The second file has been translated partly by others. I started from the first file at 0%, and finished 36% (1,054 of 2,906 words) in my first submission. Before: ⬇️ After: ##Different from the whole context of Quasar Framework documentation, the GDevelop 5 file includes short independent strings about the game editor. It took less time in translating each string, but sometimes it’s more difficult to opt for an accurate Chinese word choice due to the lack of a complete picture.

I’m joining the portrait photo contest with the head picture I took in Sri Lanka. And here’s another reason I chose the photo: I saw @mariannewest’s Tuesday prompt for the 5 Minute Freewrite is GOLD. It reminds me of this cute little girl who dressed in goldish and stood in front of some goldish saree (see the second photo below). Plus her smile in the sun, together with her sweetness and intelligence made her shine like gold. :) It’s my first time participating this Freewrite challenge, and I’m not sure if the paragraphs I’m writing in 5 minutes would meet the requirement. But it’s fun to try. If you haven’t known about this awesome daily writing challenge, feel free to check it out and join in too! So I met this GOLD girl during my travels in the tea country in Sri Lanka. I took a train from the capital city and had a few stopovers on my way. Her hometown is one of the villages I stopped by. Her mother was running a small guest house which was part of their own home. She was the youngest daughter in the family, and welcomed me when I arrived at their hillside home from the train station. She helped me register my passport info and showed me around their house. Her mother offered me some sweets and the local tea (of course ;)), and went on with her housework. So the little girl and I had a very pleasant conversation full of laughter, about her studies at school, the famous local tea, their village, my travels in her country and other random stuff. I know, seems I could enjoy talking with a 7 year-old as well as a 70 one. ;) On the wall of their living room, lots of her certificates of merit and event photos from school were displayed. Apparently she’s a smart and talented girl. And it’s proved soon. After I checked into my room, I found that the socket on the wall didn’t work for charging. So I walked downstairs to tell the girl’s mother about it. Before she replied, this GOLD girl came to the rescue. She grabbed a pencil and said:”Follow me.” After a few attempts with the magical pencil, the socket worked again. Sweet, wasn’t it? ## ##Later, when I stepped out of the house for a walk in town, I saw her helping her mom put up the golden saree for drying. Hearing my steps, she turned around and smiled to me, standing in the sun, shining like gold. ##大家好~ 这篇的照片用来参加人像摄影活动，是我在斯里兰卡的茶乡拍的。这个充满灵气的小姑娘是我入住的当地一户人家的小女儿，非常聪明可爱，跟我相谈甚欢没错，我跟上至70下至7岁的人都可以无话不谈;)，还用一支神奇的铅笔帮我修好了房间的插座。 文字部分的小故事围绕5分钟自由写作活动给出的当日主题“金”。上面英文有提到相关主办人，感兴趣的朋友也来参加吧！=) All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for visiting!

The clouds, lake and reflections added more layers to the beauty. Titiwangsa Recreational Parks spreads across an area of 95 hectares, more than half of which is a big lake. When it was under British Rule in history, this area was full of tin mining activities. Later on, it was cleaned up and developed into a green space. When we walked around the lake garden, we saw people jogging, cycling, boating, kayaking and having picnic with families or friends. This green lung in the gigantic hectic city seemed to be a popular place to relax a bit. ##这是从蒂蒂旺莎湖滨公园拍到的吉隆坡一角。英治时期，公园所在的这块地方曾是锡矿开采区。后来被清理并开发成公园绿地，面积95公顷，其中一个巨大的湖占地超过一半。我带着妈妈在这个大公园里逛了一圈，看到很多人在慢跑、划船、野餐…… 这块绿肺似乎是吉隆坡这个繁忙的大都市里休闲放松的一个好去处。 ## ## ##Posted using Partiko iOS All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for visiting!

What I want to say about the photos is just: Life can be difficult, like the young boy has to sell mangoes to help support his family;Life can be fun too, like the happy kids play catching mangoes when they don’t have fancy toys. ##Location: South EthiopiaCamera: Canon Kiss X3 ##大家好！今天就不多唠叨照片了，毕竟一张用心的摄影，也已经是跨越万水千山，胜过万语千言了对吧? 何况我还有两张耶✌ :p 只想说: 生活不容易，比如小小年纪就得卖芒果；快乐也很简单，比如我们可以扔芒果玩。 =) ##地点: 埃塞俄比亚南部某聚居地(因为只有几间草房，不知道算不算村子) + 路边的香蕉地器材: 小佳能Kiss X3总是听人说摄影是烧钱的爱好，我只想说器材真的没那么重要。虽然有些条件下会受限，但对于非专业摄影师来说，可能还是从多看多拍开始比较实际。我这最初级的几千块的相机用了近10年从来没换过，这花费很多人一年买个名牌包就没了吧，有的甚至还不够。前些天@skenan还在帖子里提到了他和众多男人的困惑，其实我这还是女人吗也是困惑不已为什么要花那么多钱去买个包，甚至还有人排长队抢购，完全不理解啊。如果你明白，欢迎留言告诉我原因，来来来，让我们一起探讨人生~ :) Thank you for reading.

What you see in the head image is the splendid sunset over this area. Now follow my post for more sunset shots from here and the story behind these mountains! =) 大家好！今天请跟我来看看澳大利亚昆士兰州的玻璃屋群山。日落时分，空中的云朵仿佛被老天打翻的调色盘染上了色彩，绮丽缤纷，我当时看到立刻掏出手机来了一张，于是便有了题图。 ##I first noticed these peaks on the way from Brisbane to Sunshine Coast. The landscape outside was dominantly coastal plains covered with green trees and plants, then out of a sudden, a few rugged peaks rose abruptly from nowhere. Hmmm, interesting. I immediately checked the map on my phone to see what they are. So these are Glass House Mountains - 13 dramatic peaks formed by volcanic activity that occurred 26 to 27 million years ago. The highest hill is called Mount Beerwah, sitting at 556 metres above sea level. It is seen as the mother hill, and Mount Tibrogargan is the father of the left 11 peaks. Among the son and daughter hills, the eldest brother is Mount Coonowrin. How lovely - it is a big family of hills! :D See some spiritual connection here? Yes, the traditional owners of this area are the Aboriginals - Jinibara and Gubbi Gubbi people. They used to gather in their spiritual home here for ceremonies and trading, and many of their ceremonial sites are still present today. Due to their cultural significance, the Glass House Mountains are listed on the Queensland and National heritage registers as a landscape of national importance. After exploring the whole region of the Sunny Coast, we moved to this cooler and greener hinterland. I feel so lucky to have this spectacular view almost daily on the way to work and back. I never get tired of it. It’s not just a feast of endless green landscape to the eyes, but also the feeling of spirituality to the mind. It is kind of magical. =) Especially when the sun is setting, the vast land appears more mysterious against all the brilliant colors of the sky. You might wonder if you can get close to this big family of hills? Yes, three of them are open to the public for bushwalking and climbing: the mother Mount Beerwah, the father Mount Tibrogargan and one of their children - Mount Ngungun. :) Hiking on the easy or challenging walking tracks through open forests is rewarding when you end up at the lookouts offering amazing panoramic views. We also love driving along the 55-kilometre Blackall Range Tourist Drive, just north of the Glass House Mountains. This is such a scenic drive on the winding country roads. Imagine the fresh mountain air, and the views all the way back to the beaches on the coast! ❤ If you want to get more active, try rock climbing, kayaking or horse-riding. Or even more adventurous, have yourself abseiling a 50-metre drop - feel the heartbeat of yourself and the heartbeat from this wild land! Catching a train ride is always fun too! The historic rail network in this area has stations dating back to the 1890s, and the tracks were first laid for transporting timber. The steam trains are now replaced by modern ones though. You can pick up a map at the Glass House Mountains Visitor and Interpretive Centre, where you can learn about attractions and their history, and buy local products such as honey and jam. The hinterland region is home to farms growing pineapples, strawberries, avocados and macadamias. There are stalls selling fresh produce along the roads. Like in the black forest of Germany, you only need to leave coins in “honesty boxes” for your purchase. ##So that’s it for today, hope you like the sunset views and the story behind these mountains? Come visit this beautiful hinterland when you get a chance! You will love it! :) ##All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 My post is inspired by @aaronli’s A City a Story photo contest themed “Sunset”.

It’s my entry to Qurator’s Photo Friday competition and Flamingirl’s  FLOWER POWER PHOTO CONTEST. Do you know an obvious difference between the cherry flower and the plum/peach flower? As you can see from the emoji and my photos, cherry blossoms’ petals have a cleft at the tip, while the other 2 don’t. At least, this is some unique feature that I observe to tell them part. =) Besides, cherry blossoms have longer stems than peach blossoms, and plum blossoms literally have no stems as they grow out from the branch itself. ## ## ##I found these trees near my home in Belgium during a cycling trip. They are full of gorgeous white to pink blossoms. Cherry blossoms have a short life of around two weeks, and are in full bloom in spring time, so they are a symbol of the spring and the fleeting nature of life. ## ## ##When I was taking pictures of these flowers a few days ago, the blossoms already started to fall, so the ground under the trees was covered by a carpet of soft petals. One man working in his garden nearby saw me and greeted me: “Hey, are you from Japan? I believe these flowers are from Japan.” :) I told him I’m not, but cherry blossom trees and their blossoms (Sakura) do play an important role in Japanese culture. Each spring, my friends who live in Japan would show me photos and videos of people enjoying Hanami (cherry blossom viewing) picnic party. During their national flower’s bloom season, Japanese people celebrate this old tradition with friends, families and co-workers underneath the cherry trees. ##Do you have cherry blossom trees where you live? Are they in full bloom right now? ## ## ## ## ##这是我在比利时住处附近拍的樱花。你最喜欢哪一张呢？ All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for visiting! Please tell me what you think.

What caught my attention was its finely incised snow-white edges. I focused on its extravagantly fringed petals when shooting, since this unique feature made it stand out from other types of tulips. Its ornate fringe comes from mutations in tulips of different categories. Tulipa Cummins usually bloom at mid to late spring, and they stay vibrant pretty long in the garden and vase. ##看到@kelvinzhang发了在荷兰库肯霍夫花园拍的绣球花，想起我在那里看到的各种花。 这次分享的是一种叫“康明斯”的郁金香，鲜黄的花蕊、紫红的花瓣和雪白的锯齿状边缘让它从花丛中脱颖而出，成功抓住我的眼球和镜头。 我拍照时聚焦在它别具一格的花瓣末端上，调大光圈虚化了绿叶和后面的几朵花。这种郁金香一般在春天的中期到晚期开花，不管是种在土里还是插在水中，都能持续鲜艳挺长一段时间，好看又好养。 去年发过对库肯霍夫花园的介绍和那里的白色郁金香： My previous post and photos about Keukenhof garden and the flowers: The Story of Tulip Mania | 郁金香泡沫的故事: ##还有白玫瑰和白雏菊： ## All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 This page is synchronized from the post: ‘#235 Tulipa Cummins | 郁金香’ document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@itchyfeetdonica/wherein-1555278055/"},{"title":"#236 Schwabenpfännle 🍛😋 | 真好吃","text":"##I had a delicious meal in a local specialty restaurant in Überlingen, a German city on the northern shore of Lake Constance.

I once joined a metalworking workshop in Antwerp and made a silver ring. Yeah, Antwerp is known as a diamond city, but a plain silver ring is much cheaper and easier to make. ;) Here are the steps I followed: ##大家周末好~ 这次分享的是我在安特卫普的一家金属手工作坊学习打造银戒指的过程。从不规则银条开始，到最后打磨为成品，自己手作戒指真是充满乐趣和成就感呀~ :) ## ##1.Cut off a silver strip and flatten the rough edges with a hand file. 2.Put that precious piece of silver bar into acid bath for cleaning. 3.Hammer the silver bar into a round(ish) shape - not an easy job, but so much fun to try this for the first time! :D 4.Solder the open silver round strip with another tiny piece of silver to close the loop. This brazing requires quite some skills and patience. I wouldn’t have achieved it without the experienced master’s help. 5.Then it comes to the most time and energy consuming part! I had to hammer the silver loop hard over a mandrel to make it more round and get the nice facets. So the whole workshop room was filled with the beautiful hammering soundsnoises for a long time (not only from me, but also from other enthusiastic apprentices. ;D) After the hard work of hammering, my ring formed some unique metal facets. Then I used the sand paper (in the middle picture 5) to deburr the edges. 6.At last, polish the ring with a polishing wheel. ##So that’s it! My handmade, one of a kind silver ring is born! ## ## ##Except for the fun and joy of making it by myself, I especially like the shiny metal facets from the aaaaarduous hammering. ;) It gives a special personal touch to the ring. To me, it’s more valuable than even a diamond ring. Do you like it too? Have you tried doing metal work or making other crafts by yourself?

The warm-toned rolling dunes, rugged mountains and special rock formations all attract visitors from afar. From the nearby town of San Pedro de Atacama, you can hike or bike along the trails leading to the valley. Deserts are not so deadly dead as I imagined. ;) On the contrary, they are pretty enchanting. So after visiting some deserts in different parts of our beautiful earth, I have been charmed to crave for more (despite being deadly burned ;p). And I’m going to the Sahara soon! Woohoo~ can’t wait!

I had the fresh delicious treat almost every week when living in Chile ~ Qué rico! :) The simple sign adds a playful touch to the traditional wooden house, and its name and the fish indicate the restaurant’s signature dish, the typical element of Chilotan architecture palafitos, and its location right by the Pacific Ocean. ## ##Here’s another sign ( actually 2 if you also count the one behind) I just captured when visiting Chefchaouen. It’s a colorful place as well but much more touristic. It’s in the Rif Mountains of northwest Morocco and is known for the old town’s blue-painted buildings.

I’m still traveling in Morocco and sharing some shots snapped at the place I stayed in Fez. Full of old-world charm, Fez is often referred to as Morocco’s cultural capital, and is famous for its walled medina with medieval Marinid architecture. From the 13th to the 15th century, the country was ruled by Marinid, a Sunni Muslim dynasty of Zenata Berber descent. The elaborate structures, ornate decorations and intricate details in this place are just amazing. They look different from the previous few riads I stayed in other towns of Morocco. Though it’s not my kind of style, I was impressed and kept wondering how much time and labor had been devoted into building and restoring this stunning palace. ##这里分享些我在摩洛哥菲斯古城住处内部拍的照片。菲斯历史悠久，常被称作摩洛哥的文化之都，尤其是旧城，处处散发着古朴神秘的韵味。 这家旅馆就位于旧城，由古老的宫殿改建而成。这些繁复精美的建筑结构和装饰跟之前在其他地方呆过的几家riad(庭院老屋)有所不同，虽然不是我喜欢的风格，但还是很让人惊叹。我边转边拍，不住地感慨，建造和修缮这些杰作该是投入了多少时间和劳力呀。 ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ##.jpg) ##.jpg) ## ##.jpg) ## ## ## ## All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for visiting!

I posted the “Syrian Girl Feeding a Cat” in 2017 when I just joined Steem: I’ve traveled quite extensively to over 60 countries and have taken numerous candid street photos, and this one remains one of my favorites. I was walking on a street in Istanbul that day and captured this beautiful loving moment. The street vendor nearby told me this is a Syrian refugee girl who is sometimes seen begging for food on that street, and I was lucky to witness her feeding a cat with the food she just got. ## All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for visiting!

So was I in an African town already? Not really. Technically I was still in European Union. Ceuta is not a town of any African country, but a Spanish autonomous city on the north coast of Africa. It’s sharing a land border with M’diq-Fnideq Prefecture in Morocco. Together with another Spanish enclave Melilla on the northern shores of Morocco’s Mediterranean coast, they form the EU’s only land borders with Africa. ## ##坐轮渡从欧洲经直布罗陀海峡来到非洲后，这Ceuta是落脚的第一个小城。虽然脚踩在非洲大陆的土地上，这里却是西班牙的属地。 Ceuta和另一座西属小城Melilla嵌在摩洛哥以北的地中海岸，共同组成了欧盟和非洲的陆上边界。就像法国最北端和英国隔海相望的加莱港一样，这里也是非洲移民难民奔向新天地的重要通道。两地也都是高墙林立、戒备森严。 本打算直接往南走，跨越国界去摩洛哥，但下船后看到这个小城还挺迷人，正好天气也给力，晴空万里、碧蓝如洗，似乎都在召唤我的双脚，就决定先在这里逛逛再走。这些照片就是瞎逛时拍下的。 ## ## ##It was a gorgeous sunny day. Blue sky and no clouds. The original plan was to go on to the south to cross the border, but the beautiful weather and cityscape attracted me to explore a bit here. So I strolled a couple of hours in this small town and snapped some shots. The beach was nice and quiet with only a few sunbathers. If I was not mistaken, there were much more sea urchins in the crystal clear water than humans . ;) ## ## ## ##Due to its strategic location, Ceuta had been an important naval base since Carthaginian and Roman times. Its early form of fortification since the 5th century was strengthened by the Portuguese in the 1540s. Today, part of the Royal Walls including the ditch and bastions remain intact. After the restoration in recent years, they have been open to the public. I walked around this heritage site oozing with history where the past battle scenes seemed to be replaying. ## ## Ceuta was actually acquired from Portugal by Spain at the end of the Iberian Union in 1640 when the 2 countries had the same King, and it served as a free port till Spain joined the EU. Later I saw a large number of Moroccans crossing the border from their country to shop and work here, and then return to Morocco in the evening. I didn’t see anyone climbing the wired fence over the border, but there’s news report about it and the crackdown of attempts to illegally emmigrate to Europe seeking for a better life. ## ## ## ## ## ##蔚蓝的天空澄澈的海水自由翱翔的鸟欢快游弋的鱼 黄白相间的建筑群生机盎然的仙人掌战火纷飞的争夺史年代久远的古城墙 如今看不见硝烟的边界处高墙上爬满锋利的铁丝网 ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ## All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for visiting!

Though considered toxic to humans, the compound muscimol it contains could make people feel less anxious and more relaxed. So the fly agaric has been used in religious practices for their hallucinogenic properties, especially in Siberia. That’s why it has been associated with the rituals of northern European and Asiatic shamans. ##A few more I found at the same place: ## ## ##这些颜色鲜艳的蘑菇是我在离住处不远的一片草地上看到的。红底白点的毒蝇伞（蛤蟆菌）似乎是毒蘑菇的经典代表？它所含的蝇蕈醇具有镇静安眠和刺激精神的效果，在一些国家的民间被作为安眠药物。它的致幻功能还常被西伯利亚和北欧的一些巫师用来通灵。据说有些地区会用这种蘑菇来毒死苍蝇、老鼠等动物，德国还有人把它们浸入酒中来治风湿痛。 回想起来，我对这种蘑菇的最初印象似乎来自小时候痴迷的游戏超级马利奥，还有蓝精灵们住的可爱蘑菇房。而《蓝精灵》也正是诞生于比利时，去年正好是它们的60周年生日，布鲁塞尔还举办了一系列的展览庆祝活动。 All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for visiting!

It is low on fat and pretty firm in texture. Its mild flavor goes very well with the more salty and rich crab risotto underneath. The crunchy marsh samphire (glasswort, sea bean, pickleweed, picklegrass) and the two types of asparagus add a fresh taste to the dish. You can smell the spring! The white asparagus has a hint of bitterness and is softer than the green one. It’s also more expensive as a result of the more time-consuming growing method. They have to be buried underground to avoid any sunlight which would turn them green. I personally prefer the grassy green asparagus than the more fibrous white one. What about you?

The baggy hood with a point at the back can protect the wearer from the sun, the snow and rain or the sand blown by strong desert wind.

Construction work on the dam was conducted from 1968 to 1971, in order to regularise the wadi to develop the agriculture in the Ziz valley, as well as to provide flood protection.

The girl in the picture was cycling hard to escape the coming storm, and the heavy rain started to pour when I walked fast till a restaurant by the square. The fried chicken restaurant franchise is called Bonchon Chicken. They are commonly seen in Southeast Asia and the USA, but there’s only 1 store in its birthplace of South Korea. So I ordered a coffee and a Bibimbap while waiting for the rain to stop. I’m not sure if the meal was genuinely Korean, but it tasted great and this place offered a nice view point for the palace and the square. 拍这前几张照片时，正好赶上狂风大作、乌云压城。路上的行人都加快了脚步，那位骑车的妹纸也开始猛踩踏板，拼命想躲过即将来临的大雨。果然，等我一路小跑到前面一家小餐馆时，立刻暴雨倾盆。 而这家叫Bonchon的韩式连锁餐厅的位置和环境都不错，是个看风景躲雨的好地方，值得推荐。这餐馆主打炸鸡，在东南亚和美国见到不少，据说它起源于釜山，在本土却只开了一家，看来是个墙内开花墙外香的典型呀。我不禁想到熊猫快餐、左宗棠鸡、幸运饼干这类吃的，哈哈…… 其实开始只打算喝点东西躲个雨，结果雨一直下个不停，奶茶、咖啡都喝完了还没有停的迹象。我都等饿了，只好又点了份石锅拌饭。看上去应该不是韩国人做的，而是统一培训出来的，但味道还可以，咖啡的花也拉得挺熟练~ ##.jpg) ##.jpg) Address: 地址： ##View from the upstairs of the Korean restaurant: 从餐馆楼上看出去： ##.jpg) ##About 2 hours later, the downpour stopped, and locals went on picnicing. This square and the river side seemed to be a popular place for tourists as well as the locals to relax. 过了两个小时左右，雨终于停了，很多当地人也陆续冒出来，继续席地野餐： .jpg) ##The whole complex covers an extensive area of 174,870 square metres. Its throne hall, defensive wall, Temple of the Emerald Buddha, stupas and towering spires are all typical elements of Khmer architecture with a slight French touch. ## ##In the mid-19th century, the construction of the palace started after the royal capital was relocated here from Oudong. The site was chosen at the Western bank of the cross division of the two important rivers - Mekong River and Tonle Sap River. ## ##The Kings of Cambodia have lived in the palace since it was built except for the period of the Khmer Rouge. ##Have you visited the Royal Palace of Cambodia?

It’s Tasty Tuesday time! I devoured a big bowl of Laksa last Sunday evening in the Chinatown ( only a short street) of Antwerp. It reminds me of those delicious Laksas I enjoyed in Malaysia and Singapore. ##上周日晚在安特卫普的唐人街吃了一大碗叻沙，让我想起在马来西亚和新加坡大饕叻沙的日子。叻沙是马来语Laksa的发音，是道起源于马来西亚的面食料理，相信大马和新加坡的朋友们肯定非常熟悉，因为这和椰浆饭、炒粿条等都是新马的美食代表，在那边的街头随处可见，主要有咖哩叻沙、亚三叻沙等口味。 ##In my picture above, it is a Laksa I had in 328 Katong Laksa on the East Coast Road of Singapore. In a 2013 cooking showdown, 328 Katong Laksa beat the celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay. This result surely made it even more famous. The Laksa was inspired by the Straits Chinese who live in the precinct of Katong. I quickly finished the aromatic seafood and rice vermicelli soaked in the spicy broth flavoured with coconut milk and dried shrimp. It tasted divine! ## ##And I loved the Laksa from Toast Box, but I forgot to take pictures of the food there since I simply ate too many Laksas those days, so only a Laksa photo from the shop when I left: ;) .jpg) ##Though we can find Laksa easily in Malaysia and Singapore, it’s rare here in Belgium. There are only 3 to 4 Malaysian restaurants in the whole country (I haven’t tried the 4th one yet as I can’t find any pictures of it online but only a name and address, would check it out one day), and not every one of them sells Laksa. Luckily Belgium is small in size, so I’m grateful to enjoy some hearty Asian meals occasionally without driving too far. :) ## ##As for the precious Laksa here, it’s normal that there’s not a variety of choices like Nyonya Laksa, Johor Laksa, Sarawak Laksa, Penang Asam Laksa… but only the most common curry mee with coconut-based curry broth. I feel this is the more mild flavored Laksa comparing to other types I tried in Malaysia? Any Malaysian or Singaporean Steemians please correct me if I got it wrong. ## ##As you can see from my photos, the toppings include prawns, fish cakes/balls, tofu puffs, bean sprouts, long beans, scallions, eggplants, and even char siu (Cantonese barbecue pork) pieces… It’s rich and fragrant as always. Slurp, slurp, slurp~ ## ##I just found these pictures from my phone taken in Kuala Lumpur - similar noodle soup I had in the cafe restaurant chain Old Town White Coffee. It’s much cheaper and more spicy: ## More Foodie Posts:更多吃货帖： Dorado with Crab Risotto | 海鲤蟹肉饭 Beef Tajine | 牛肉塔吉锅 Cook with Donica - Make a Savory Crepe | 自制煎饼 Ramen | 暖心拉面 Phở Bò @Hanoi | 美味的越南牛河 A Szechuan Restaurant in Belgium | 比利时正宗川菜馆推荐 Cooking Video: Creamy Garlic Scampi | 美味蒜香虾做法视频 Japanese Food Experience in a German Medieval Town | 德国童话古镇的日餐推荐 Cook with Donica - Fish with Pickled Cabbage ‍ | 一起来做酸菜鱼 Cook with Donica - Braised Pork with Tofu and Shiitake | 跟我做香菇豆腐红烧肉 Cook with Donica - Satay Fried Rice | 来做简单美味的沙爹炒饭 Foodie’s Photo Journal of Sydney Fish Market | 带你逛悉尼海鲜市场 Vietnamese Street Food - Mini-Pancakes | 越南街头的迷你煎饼 Dirty Duck Restaurant in Ubud, Bali | 脏鸭馆的美食故事 Come Visit the Rotterdam Market Hall with Me | 号称全球颜值最高的菜市场长什么样？ All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for visiting!

I commented that I would add a head picture of a great poop in my post if I link it too, then my content might look a bit less shitty with the original touch… ;) And last night, 2 CN shining tycoons @deanliu and @ericet informed me that my Steem Attention Rate was ranked the 50th ahead of other CN users on Snax at that moment. I was like, really? That’s pretty ridiculous, as I was not even super active recently. Hmmm, looked like a nice algorithm… And it reminded me again to do this shit post to embrace the cool new kid in town. :) So here we go, let me present you this precious poop photo I took earlier this month in the Sahara. It was after a storm, I found this little insect next to a camel (dromedary to be exact) poop. ## ##Don’t you think dung beetle is an amazing creature? They can roll those massive dung balls like a pro with so much tenacity and perseverance. Sounds a bit like us Steemians who still stick to this platform with no less passion even when the price is so low? ;p I even did a meme to make my image look more wiseass.

I’ve visited almost all EU countries, among which the Baltic states are the first few ones. I guess I’m kind of weird, as most people would first go to places like Paris and Rome when they visit Europe. But I found these Baltic countries pretty enchanting. In this post I’d love to share with you some information about Užupis, one of the world’s smallest republics in the middle of the Lithuanian capital. The Republic of Užupis only covers less than 1 square km within Vilnius, but it has its own president, constitution, bishop and even two churches. ## ##The guide of the walk tour told us Užupis means “behind the river” in Lithuanian. You can see a bit of “the river” Vilnelė in my photo here ;). Used to be the city’s poorest and roughest area during the former Soviet Union time, this unique republic now attracts more and more visitors. Like in many art districts of the big cities around the world, artists came first for the cheap accommodation, and eventually transformed the neighborhoods into a vibrant creative community. Nowadays, it hosts various events like exhibitions, concerts, fashion festivals and poetry evenings. ##This is my entry to the cityscape (or countryscape in this case? ;p) photo contest, posted with @partiko on my phone, and I’ll share more photos and info about this artistic republic in my coming post. So stay tuned and see you soon! ##Posted using Partiko iOS All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for reading. Please tell me what you think in the comments.

Inspired by @kus-knee’s “The Weird is Good Art Contest”, I’m showing you a piece of artwork I saw last year. It was displayed at the Triennial exhibition in the Melbourne NGV (National Gallery of Victoria), Australia’s oldest public art museum. The exhibition was showcasing contemporary artworks of over 100 artists and designers from 32 countries. ## ##This sculptural installation was created by Chinese artist Xu Zhen, a leading figure among the younger contemporary artists in China. He is also a curator and entrepreneur, having worked across photography, video, painting and performance art. Except for the replication of the famous reclining buddha statue here, you can see different sculptural figures from Greek and Roman mythology on and around it. The entire work is over 15 metres long. ## ##Xu Zhen explored his Buddhist heritage and attempted to address barriers by bringing Eastern and Western cultural traditions together. In his own words: I have always been curious about the differences between cultures and the alienation between them. And yet, misconceptions can be the beginning of awareness and understanding. I actually feel the same. What do you think of this artwork? Have you seen any cross-culture artworks that you would love to share? ## ##I once did a post about another artwork from the same exhibition:以前发过篇同一展览中一个日本艺术团体的作品： A Magical Light Show of Vortices Created by Movement 酷炫奇幻的漩涡光影秀 ## ##今天分享的是在墨尔本的维州国立美术馆NGV看到的一件中国艺术家的雕塑作品：徐震的《永生 – 涅槃佛》。 NGV是澳洲历史最悠久的公共艺术馆，这场持续5个月的三年展占据了整个国际馆的四层楼，来自世界各地100多位艺术家的作品不仅让我大饱眼福，也让我有机会亲身体验了很多有意思的交互展品。包括前沿技术、建筑、动画、表演、电影、绘画、素描、时尚设计、挂毯和雕塑等。其中还有另外一位中国设计师的作品：郭培设计的高级定制礼服。 徐震特别为这次NGV三年展创作了这件雕塑作品，在著名的唐代大卧佛身上还有四周，有很多古希腊古罗马的经典雕塑：垂死的高卢人、法尔内塞赫拉克勒斯、夜、昼、受伤的阿喀琉斯、波斯战士、酒神女祭司、克里斯托弗·德的陵墓雕塑、跳舞的农牧之神、蹲着的阿弗洛狄忒、那耳喀索斯、垂死的斯巴达、坠落的伊卡洛斯、河流、克罗托的米罗。 这件宏大的雕塑总长超过15米，结合了东西方的宗教经典，试图探索文化差异，寻求沟通和对话。徐震说自己一直对文化间的差别和异化充满好奇，而迷思则可以作为认知和理解的开端。你对此又是怎么看的呢？ All content by @itchyfeetdonica图文 by Donica多 Thank you for reading.
