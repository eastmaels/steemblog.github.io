            <p><strong>The pinkest creature on the blockchain, @techslut is our Chief Marketing Officer, lives and breathes Utopian.io and defines herself as a geeky pink polyamorous polyglot and social justice rogue. Meet the pink lady that seems to be everywhere.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Who are you, @techslut?</em></strong></p>
<p>I am a content writer in Israel with pink hair and too many years of experience as a technology journalist, marketer, advertiser and copywriter. When I am not plotting the future of open source economy with Utopian.io as a world-known brand, I watch science fiction shows, read technology related news, and spend time with my significant others. Yes, others. There is more than one. I live an open source kind of life.</p>
<p>In the past I practiced martial arts including Muai Thai and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, cooked delicious dishes and liked long walks. This all took a back seat when I became ill with fibromyalgia, an unpleasant chronic pain condition that forces me to work from home (rather than an office) and causes me to be sleepy and grumpy half the time. People say the other half is worth tolerating the sleepy and grumpy me.</p>
<p>Writing is my life. I&#x2019;ve always written and will continue to write as long as I can put letters on paper / screen. I&#x2019;ve worked as a technology journalist, blogged from the age of dial-up internet, and even had a few poems of mine published locally. Being as pink and as active I am on social media, I am considered a very minor local Facebook celebrity in some circles.</p>

<p><strong><em>What brought you to the Steem blockchain, and how did that path lead to Utopian.io?</em></strong></p>
<p>In late 2016 I visited a friend of mine in Israel (@simba) who very excitedly told me of a blogging platform where he made money just posting photographs. I was intrigued. I joined, made a few posts and some STEEM, but life got in the way and I abandoned my steemit blog, promising myself I would return to monetize the writing process of my novel. </p>
<p>When cryptocurrency became &#x201C;hot&#x201D; again in 2017, I returned to Steemit, as I said I would, and began to publish my novel with the help of the kind editors on @theisleofwrite. Payouts were nice, and I was getting involved with initiatives (and getting in trouble with some bernies) when I saw a post by @elear about an inspiring new initiative on the blockchain aimed at rewarding voluntary contributions to open source projects. My reaction? I delegated half of my then SP to @utopian-io.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, Utopian.io didn&#x2019;t quite need my little delegation as it became one of the most successful initiatives to pop up on Steem with a truly revolutionary vision. So I looked for other ways to help and found myself bugging @elear daily and calling myself his human Siri in an attempt to try and get involved. It eventually worked.</p>
<p><strong><em>What is your role in Utopian.io and what do you actually do?</em></strong></p>
<p>I wear two hats in Utopian - that of the Visibility category manager and that of the chief marketer. While I postpone my investment in my category until Utopian can once again offer a more &#x201C;marketer friendly&#x201D; interface, I focus on community activities, PR and marketing efforts to make Utopian.io a familiar name on the lips of the global open source community.</p>
<p>Among others, I write, edit or proof the majority of the content published on Utopian.io Steemit blogs (@utopian.edu and @utopian-io), report the news (and make things funny) on the Utopian.io Open Source Radio Show on MSP Waves, and chat to many project owners looking for advice and consultation on how to best draw contributors and users to their projects.</p>

<p><strong><em>What other steem communities / initiatives are you part of?</em></strong></p>
<p>I tend to make connections wherever I go, so I have friends at @buildteam, I founded the Israeli Steemit community, contributed some to various initiatives here and there, and I try to help out wherever I can whenever I have the time. I believe this blockchain is home to many amazing people and communities, and it has the potential to host many more. Whatever I can do to promote that - I do.</p>
<p><strong><em>Being a marketer and author, how do you feel you contribute to Utopian.io and open source?</em></strong></p>
<p>Open source needs more marketers. If you look around the FOSS ecosystem, it is full of developers and technologists, while marketers and content creators shy away from this often elitist group. I do not shy away. It&#x2019;s not my style. And the ecosystem needs me.</p>
<p>In a blog series I started writing (and promise to continue), I discussed the importance of content and marketing for open source projects. In short: you can&#x2019;t get collaborators or users for your project if you don&#x2019;t go out and tell people it exists.</p>
<p>My years of experience marketing mobile apps and promoting content for major brands and companies in the technological industries have given me a unique insight into the relationship between technology, people and money. I hope this knowledge and experience can be of use to Utopian.io and to projects on Utopian.io as well.</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you see the future of Utopian? What would you want it to be, and where would you like to see yourself in it?</em></strong></p>
<p>From the very first moment, I knew Utopian.io had the potential to be a stellar success. It&#x2019;s why I quit my other jobs and decided to focus on it 100%. The future I see is bright. I believe Utopian.io will continue to grow at an exponential rate now that the teams and workflows are better organized that before. I am really looking forward to seeing the new frontend in action and reading the feedback from the users of the beta.</p>
<p>I hope to continue in my role as CMO in Utopian.io for a long time. I hope to someday onboard grandchildren to the platform, if I have any. I also hope to see my team of content creators and public relations managers grow, and perhaps include something resembling a &#x201C;sales&#x201D; team in the future as well.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is your favorite thing about Utopian?</em></strong></p>
<p>Undoubtedly the people. May of this year was a trying month for Utopian.io as an organization. We lost everything but the people, really. What we had at the end of the day were the faith of our investors, the skills of our team and the sheer persistence of our mutual vision. We persevered and didn&#x2019;t miss a beat, coming out even stronger and wiser from the disaster that struck at our Utopia. I believe that it is those &#x201C;make or break&#x201D; moments that define an organization and can indicate its potential for success. Utopian.io passed that test with flying colors thanks to the amazing people on the team.</p>
