What Do You Think?","text":"Utopian.io is the first platform rewarding Open Source contributors and it is doing that with Steem. Utopian started exactly 2 months ago and today we reached the big number: 2000 CONTRIBUTIONS FOR STEEM BASED PROJECTS! We need your feedback. Please read and comment! 2000 ContributionsIn 2 months Utopian.io was able to generate an incredible amount of contributions being promoted only on Steemit. Utopian.io took a while before having traction so actually this number has been generated in a much shorter time than 2 months that is the entire lifespan of the project. But We Have A Problem! Utopian.io is not funded by anyone and survives thanks to the sponsors who have delegated SP, thanks to the founders investing in the project from their own pocket and thanks to Steemit inc. that has donated 50K liquid Steem in order for Utopian.io to be able to create Steem accounts directly on the platform. The thing is, we need more funds to let this platform go global. As every other project on the Steem blockchain most of the traction comes from inside Steemit but when big competitors appear you easily get kicked in the *. We Need To React! Utopian.io is the FIRST platform in the World rewarding Open Source contributors but other similar platforms are taking this merit because they have the big bucks and use those to get promoted. Want an example: Gitcoin Joins ConsenSys, Announces Pilot Projects: https://media.consensys.net/gitcoin-joins-consensys-announces-pilot-projects-f5a0955de9d6 FundRequest: (got more than 700K USD) https://fundrequest.io/ It is time for Utopian.io to go to the outside world and since we are not ready for an ICO and waiting for the SMT we must find other tools to get A. Traction outside Steemit B. Funds. Going To KickStarterThis is why we came up with the idea Utopian.io could be presented on KickStarter.com by proposing the Utopian Version 2 on which we are working on. We believe Utopian.io is the perfect example of a project that will work well on Kickstarter for the message it brings. We Need Your FeedbackDoing a Kickstarter campaign is much more than hitting a button to submit a post. We need to work on the gigs and find appealing gigs that Kickstarters will likely want. What Do You Think? Which Gigs could be interesting?Some suggestions: Placements on Utopian for project maintainers of Open Source startups Sponsorship in the platform in various forms Merchandising? We are working with @stellabelle thinking about the gigs, because they do make a difference. Do You Have Experience with KickStarter Campaigns?If you have experience in running a successful Kickstarter campaign get in touch with us: https://discord.gg/Pc8HG9x If We Win The CampaignIf we win the campaign the funds will be partially moved into Steem and partially used to run aggressive marketing campaigns.

The responsibility in managing such a big amount of SP is huge and we are constantly improving the bot to avoid either giving too much or giving too little. The change we just made is a complete new bot written from scratch, having different mechanisms than the one we had so far, that were not working well 100% of the time. The Bot Now Follows The Human Input The Utopian Bot now votes after at least 6 hours the post has been submitted and reviewed by a moderator, in order for the post to gain enough visibility and votes. The bot calculates the weights used by every single human vote and uses those averages to decide its own voting weight. Removed Penalisation For Automated Votes The bot does not penalise any longer bots but exclude the votes of automated bots from the weight calculation, therefore nulling the amount of rewards received from those bots when calculating the voting weight. The Bot Has Now A 35% Maximum Cap The bot never votes over 35% in a single vote. We will increase this cap once the quality of the posts in Utopian has reached the required status to get higher compensation. The Bot Never Wastes More Than 20% VP The Bot calculates the total amount of contributions on each category that must be voted and assigns a weight pool to them. Based on the weight calculated and the pool, the final score will be generated. We Want To Help Small Accounts The Bot increases a little bit the voting weight for: Accounts with less than 500 followers Your first contribution on the platform We Want You To Contribute Often The bot gives a bit more the more you contribute with quality contributions. The Bot is Open Source https://github.com/utopian-io/api.utopian.io/blob/master/utopian-bot.js Avoiding The Flagging War At Any CostThere is a flagging war around and Utopian is not interested in participating. We are doing our best to keep the rewards reasonable and trying to respect and grow the ecosystem in every single action we do. We will keep doing our best, we will keep moderating our platform and increasing its quality.

Content Discovery In Steemit - 100% Upvote. Total 3K Bounties Available","text":"Utopian.io rewards Open Source contributors for their hard work. We have quite a few bounties available if you did not notice and many many things going on. There is a LOT of demand regarding Content Discovery on the Steemit frontend. Many users complaining about the Trending page becoming useless. Lets fix that! We are proposing a 100% Utopian Bot Upvote bounty for the designer/s and developer/s who can create the best working solution to fix the trending page on steemit/condenser. Plus Utopian is running quite a few development streams you could be interested in, for a total of 3K bounties to be delivered. Steemit Trending PageIf you look at the trending page you will most likely see the same contents over and over, simply because the more SP you have the more likely you will be there. There are accounts who follow different threads, others focused on the same thread, therefore making the Trending page not appealing for readers having different interests. Lets Fix The Trending PageUtopian.io is running this contest to find designer/s and developer/s willing to provide a working solution to make content discovery on the trending page easier and more appealing. The winners will receive a 100% Utopian Upvote, worth more than $300. Utopian is for collaboration, so if you are going to work on this with more people, post one contribution only for the design and one contribution only for the development, then split the rewards and mention the people involved. If You WinThe Utopian upvote is not about having only a big reward but it is also about going to the trending and show your work to the big Steemit community. The reward is a small portion of the benefit you are going to have on the long run if you win this contest. Rules If you are willing to participate to the contest, write in the comments your profession and what you are willing to do. We want to promote collaboration. Only push your contribution in Utopian once the work is done. For the design means when the layout is ready, for the development when the PR is submitted. We cannot guarantee the PR will be merged but it is up to you to convince the Steemit team to do so ( @sneak could be the right guy to ask for some suggestions ). Once done place a comment about the work completed in this post. Ready? GO!3K Bounties in TotalIf you have not noticed yet we have quite a few development streams and bounties in place.

Better wording on the bot comment for those who had difficulties understanding the bot logics. The bot now does not wait an hour when it reaches 100% but checks constantly. In this way no voting power is wasted. Added a difficulty factor. Thanks to @stoodkev for this one. Please up vote his contribution. Dedicated Section for Tasks RequestsTasks requests are one of the most important features in Utopian.io, since allow project maintainers to request for very specific tasks contributors can work on. There was no way to spot them unless you was aware of the URL to the project page, that is why we made a specific section for them. Thanks to @mooncryption. Please upvote his contributions.

Look How We GROW The Value of STEEM!","text":"Here at Utopian.io we have been working hard to release this new ground-breaking feature that we believe will change the game for us and for Steem, completely. Direct Delegation To Projects is HERE! Project Owners Can Now Create Bounties For FREE!Utopian.io has a bot powered by almost 4 Million SP and guess how we made it? By looking for sponsors. So we realised that we should have given the very same opportunity to every Open Source project out there. Project owners can now look for sponsors or become sponsors themselves by delegating to their projects and by using the delegated power to upvote the project contributors immediately. Think About This For A Second…or Two.Project maintainers can look for sponsors and delegate their own power to their own projects, practically generating BOUNTIES FOR FREE. We believe this is something unseen on earth and will be very appealing for EVERY project owner out there, therefore making them willing to load up their STEEM accounts to delegate to their own projects in order to generate FREE BOUNTIES by just upvoting. New Investors - More Value - Bounties For Free - WIN - WIN - WIN. What Is The Benefit Instead Of Delegating to The Project Owner Directly?Utopian.io creates a separate account dedicated for the project that is usable by all the project maintainers to ONLY upvote the contributors of the project, therefore producing the following: A project owner will never be able to waste the voting power to upvote hamburgers or steaks. The voting power of the project account can only be used by the project owners to upvote the project contributions. The account is managed by utopian-io, a third party, trusted community. The project owners do not have access to the ad-hoc Steem project account, ever. Enabling organisations or projects managed by more entities to use a third party account to upvote the contributions, without having to share credentials. Utopian.io automatically recognises who are the project owners and enables them. How The Process Work?A project owner can request to enable the Utopian Sponsorship Module from the project page. The request will be submitted and reviewed manually by the Utopian staff. The request can be either accepted or rejected. If rejected a message with the reason of the rejection will be shown. If the request is accepted the ad-hoc account will be created and the Sponsorship module enabled. No more steps are required from the project owners. They can immediately delegate to their own project and go looking for Sponsors. Voting Slider - DOUBLED UP!Now everyone on Utopian will be able to use the voting slider. Project owners having the Sponsorship module enabled will also have the option to upvote with the sponsor account. Are You Ready To Generate Bounties For Free?We are. Visit Utopian.io, sync your Github account and enable the Sponsorship module. Delegate your own power to the project and start looking for sponsors right away! The Utopian Bot will keep voting EVERY contribution, so the free bounties you can generate are on top of the standard Utopian vote. Delicious rewards for the contributors on the horizon!!!

Now it is fixed for real. In percent_steem_dollars we were adding 5000, but then realised it should be 10000, even though this does not make much sense in our opinion. This is why you were receiving more SP than SBD. Now the bug is over since 3 days and new posts using the option 50/50 should work as expected. Beneficiary System For AuthorsWhen you post in Utopian.io a minimum of 15% to a maximum of 25% of your author rewards is given back to the sponsors and to the moderators, since it is thanks to the sponsors that you can get high votes and it is thanks to moderators if the quality of our platform is increasing. The 15-25% will be taken from the 75% of your author rewards, while the remaining 25% is taken by Steem for the curation rewards. So your earnings are 75% of the total amount your post got, minus 15-25% given back to the Utopian Sponsors and Moderators. Beneficiary System For SponsorsWhen you become an Utopian Sponsor you will be added as beneficiary in the posts created on utopian. 20% of the author rewards are dedicated to the sponsors based on how much they delegate. As a sponsor the more you delegate the sooner you will be included in the beneficiaries and rewarded. This is because Steem only accepts max 8 beneficiaries per post. This also means if you un-delegate before being included as a beneficiary of any post, you may end up not getting anything. There is a queue managed by Utopian and you can see how much you are supposed to get under Should Receive More in the Utopian.io Sponsors Page. The Should Receive More tells you how much you have already accumulated and DOES NOT include the pending rewards not yet cashed out. So actually you will get more than what you see in Should Receive More. It is a deferred system. With this system the only thing you have to do to get your rewards is to show commitment and not un-delegate until you get what you are supposed to get. Why Utopian Is Being Now Included As a Beneficiary?@Ned is still a sponsor but has rejected his rewards. So he does not get a cent from delegating to Utopian. As a sponsor when you decline your rewards, the rewards you should have got will be given to the main @utopian-io account and used to delegate to other projects or to reward the contributions with the Utopian Bot.

The way it was working before required a huge change, since many smaller sponsors were waiting in line for weeks without seeing a cent. The New Sponsorship Module is HERE! Now get Liquid Steem every week, based on how much you have delegated. Never wait in line to get your rewards any longer. Becoming an Utopian SponsorYou can become an Utopian Sponsor by delegating your Steem Power to Utopian using the “DELEGATE” button on the Utopian Sponsors page. Sponsors share 20% of all the author rewards generated on Utopian, based on the amount of the delegation. The more you delegate the more you will profit from the 20% shared between all the sponsors. Benefits of Delegating VS CuratingWe encourage everyone to keep curating, since curation is fundamental for this platform, but you may want to delegate your voting power to Utopian and have a passive income. No need for curation. Just delegate and earn your rewards every week. You receive Liquid Steem not Steem Power. Gain visibility by being credited on every Utopian post and marketing activity. Help the growth of the Open Source ecosystem and the growth of the Steem ecosystem. Old Utopian Sponsorship Module VS NewOldThe old Utopian sponsorship module was adding sponsors to the beneficiaries of each single post. By doing this, smaller delegators had to wait in line before being added (max 8 beneficiaries per post are possible). On top of that is impossible to predict how much a single contribution may gain. NewThe new sponsorship module set only one account as beneficiary of all the posts at a fixed 25%. This account is managed by Utopian. Every time this account receives a benefactor reward, the reward is summed with all the other rewards of the week and then split: 20% to the Sponsors based on how much they have delegated 5% to the moderators based on how many contributions they have reviewed. The new system sends Liquid Steem instead of Steem Power. Transition From Old To NewIt will take a week for all the posts using the old sponsorship module to be cashed out. Once all those posts have been cashed out, Utopian will manually send to all the sponsors and moderators the pending amounts. From that time on the new sponsorship module will be running and Sponsors and Moderators paid automatically for all the new rewards. The section Utopian Sponsor will be then updated accordingly. IMPORTANT TO KNOWTo avoid gaming the system: If you un-delegate before a week has been paid, you will not receive rewards for that week. Un-delegation immediately removes you from the beneficiaries. BECOME A SPONSOR!Good News For Moderators And SupervisorsModerators will now earn their rewards immediately. Supervisors will also get an additional percentage, 20% of the shares owned by the supervised moderators will be given to them. This percentage won’t be removed by the Moderators, but paid on top by Utopian.

Practically project owners will be able to use the voting power dedicated to them, upvoting directly with the @utopian-io account. Sponsors (Delegators) will be able to decide how to split their voting power between different projects. If a sponsor does not do that, Utopian will decide how to split initially. If any voting power remains unused, this voting power will be used to upvote all the contributions not yet voted by the project owners. Old Delegation To Projects VS NewOLDAs a sponsor you could already decide to give your voting power to different projects on Utopian. The problem is most of the biggest delegators have already delegated their voting power to Utopian itself and it is hard to find other biggest delegators for the many projects. NEWInstead of begging the biggest delegators to give their voting power to other projects, we will just use the voting power Utopian already has and split it internally. Sponsors may still want to decide how their voting power should be split but if that does not happen, Utopian will take over and moving the voting power to the different interesting projects looking for growth. Easy as a pie. Sponsors Still Have ProfitsAs a sponsor (delegator) does not matter how you will split your voting power, you will still have the 20% of the author rewards generated on Utopian reserved for you and earn liquid Steem every week. Read the details The Bot Sucks!Lets be honest, the bot is good when it is about distribution but it is not good when it is about judging quality. No algorithm will ever be able to judge a contribution better than the project owner. The more Utopian will grow the more likely the bot will disappear completely from the system. Spontaneous Contributions VS Task RequestsIt is nice to see spontaneous contributions coming every day, even when project owners did not request for them, but this is not how Utopian is meant to work at the end. Project owners can use task requests to crowdsource their project by asking contributors for specific tasks to do. The task requests are not yet much used in Utopian and the reason for this is that project owners do not have enough voting power to fairly reward their contributors. By splitting the delegation given to Utopian internally, project owners will have much more voting power they can use and most likely they will be very happy to use the task requests. This approach will produce: Contributions will be focused on what the project owners want. The rewards are decided by humans and not by a bot and no one is better than project owners to decide what is a quality contribution. Spontaneous contributions will still be voted with the unused voting power, but there are way more possibilities for them to be voted by project owners directly, since project owners will use Utopian more actively. ModerationModeration now is cross-site. This is another important thing we will change in the future. We will still have cross-site moderators, but project owners can pick their own moderators. If a contribution is not being reviewed by the moderators of the project, a cross-site moderator will take over. Rules will still be applied but only as a general draft project based moderators should use when approving or rejecting a contribution. When?The delegation internal split will happen in few days. The new project based moderation will be ready by no longer than 1 month. Projects That Will Have the Biggest Initial Delegation SplitSponsors will decide how to split their own delegation to different projects, but from the very first day Utopian will already decide the first split. Sponsors will then be able to change the split if they wish to do so. - Busy.org by @busy.org will be given 500K. Busy will be able to generate more than $700 rewards a day.- Minecolonies by @reggaemuffin will be given at least 150K. Minecolonies will be able to generate more than $250 rewards a day.- Vessel from @jesta will be given 200K. Vessel will be able to generate more than $340 rewards a day.- Esteem by @good-karma will be given 300K. Esteem will be able to generate more than $500 rewards a day.Other projects will be given the initial delegation split. Please if you run a project and you want to receive the first delegation split get in touch with us on Discord. WAIT FOR IT! THE NEW DELEGATION SPLIT WILL BE READY IN FEW DAYS!

If you delegate to @utopian-io using the Utopian.io Sponsors section, you will be entitled of the 20% of all the author rewards generated on Utopian based on how much you have delegated. Today we started the new system that pays in liquid STEEM every week, find below the results. This first round only summed up the posts cashed in the last 24 hours. First Round ResultsExample as a Sponsor@freedom has received 139 STEEM. This first round only summed up the posts cashed in the last 24 hours. So this amount of Steem is what @freedom will get a day in average, paid out on a weekly basis. @freedom should receive an average 970 Liquid STEEM a week for having delegated 1.2 M Steem Power to Utopian, therefore making an average 4% passive and liquid profit a year. The amount of STEEM may vary based on the author rewards generated on Utopian. Example as a ModeratorModerators share 5% of the author rewards based on how many contributions they review in total. Our top moderator and supervisor @espoem is receiving 12 STEEM for this round, therefore making a weekly average payout of 70 STEEM. The amount of STEEM may vary based on the author rewards generated on Utopian. This is Just The BeginningOur main mission is to bring much more investors in STEEM/Utopian, therefore increasing even more the profits for moderators, delegators/sponsors and contributors of the platform. Delegating now to @utopian-io means committing yourself to the growth of Utopian for your benefit and the benefits of the community as a whole. 7K Contributions Given To The Open SourceFrom nowhere, Utopian brought 7K contributions to the Open Source world in less than 85 days. 223K Generated in RewardsUtopian has generated so far more than 223K SBD/SP in Rewards for authors and curators.

Changes to the rules and to the platform were discussed and soon implemented during the Utopian Poll 12/23/2017. Results of the Utopian Poll For the development category, we should allow only pull requests that have been merged recently (no longer than 30 days). [RESULT: YES] Moderators and Supervisors should be divided into categories and a single moderator/supervisor should only review a specific category. [RESULT: NO] If moderators will be only allowed to review specific categories, should we have developers moderating the development category and also make sure the repository does not contain any obvious unsafe or outdated code? [RESULT: NO] Blogs posts should be in any language and not English only. [RESULT: YES] Contributions under the Translations category will be rejected if they are obviously machine translated. [RESULT: YES] We should delete this sentence from the Visibility Category rules: If your effort brought 0 or very little new users/contributors to the Open Source project you are invited to not write about it. [RESULT: NO] A moderator may reject a contribution in the Visibility Category if the moderator believes there are not enough results for the contribution to be rewarded. [RESULT: YES] In the Graphic Category, logo designs should be in vector format UNLESS the project owner specifies a different format, only editable shapes are allowed in PSD files, flatten and rasterized layers are not editable. [RESULT: YES] In the Translation Category, we should accept a contribution from other translation platforms not only Github or CrowdIn. (write in the comments the platforms that you believe should be acceptable) [RESULT: NO] We should make a whitelist of languages we can accept based on languages moderators can understand. This list should grow over time. [RESULT: YES] Enhance the rules for the blog category with this sentence: You must provide original and unique editorial content of a very high quality that is strongly related to the promotion and development of open-source related projects. [RESULT: YES] In the blog category, contributors should be forced to pick a GitHub repository to link the blog post to a specific Open Source project. [RESULT: YES] We should make a repository blacklists. Every contribution under these repositories will be rejected. [RESULT: YES] Supervisors should have a weekly voice conference with the moderators. Each team will make a public review in this voice session.

The following are updates/enhancements to existing rules. Please read all the rules here: https://utopian.io/rules A special thanks to @espoem for having reviewed and updated them. Contributions should be in English Contributions should be in plain English and fully understandable. The only accepted exceptions are: Contributions under the Tutorials and Video Tutorials Category, and Blog posts. Development Rules The contribution will be rejected if the Pull Request wasn’t merged within the last 30 days. Projects must have a README file for installation and usage. In this category you can only write if you have developed or contributed to the development. Simple and common code snippets can’t be submitted in the development category. Translations Rules Minimum 500 words per translation contribution. Text that is supposed to remain untranslated (links, code, paths, …) or duplicated strings/text can’t be included in the minimum. If the provided translation is obviously machine-translated, the contribution will be rejected. Visibility Rules Moderators may reject the contribution if they believe that there are not enough results for the contribution to be rewarded. Graphics Rules You must provide the editable files, as PSD and similar source files. Flatten and rasterized layers are not editable. Logo designs must be in a vector format unless the project owner specifies a different format. Blog Post Rules You must provide an original and a unique editorial content of very high quality that is strongly related to the promotion and development of open-source related projects. Blogs must have a unique and consistent format. Moderators For contributors, remember that Utopian Moderators reserve the right to a) verify acceptable posts, b) deliberate and review pending posts, and c) flag/hide posts that do not follow the rules or posts that are of very low quality. Additionally, moderators reserve the right to apply temporal or permanent bans who have shown a history of consistently disobeying the rules. Every moderator works on a specified set of categories and is assigned to one supervisor. You can see the spreadsheet with the moderators teams here Utopian bot Utopian can unvote the contribution if it is found out that the contribution did not meet the rules and had been upvoted by mistake. This decision considers cases such as attempts of plagiarism, copying work and ideas of others or other violation of the rules which would be obvious to see that the contribution does not deserve the reward.

Time To Work Your A** Off!

The reasons are: Developers do not like to write about their work. In Utopian we promise we will automate the process almost completely. Rewards were low. We just doubled them up. Doubled Up The Reward Pool For Development CategoryWe have just changed the reward pool reserved to the development category and double it up. In order to do this we had to reduce the rewards from other categories, mainly the translations category. The reason why we opted to remove a portion of the reward pool from the translations category is because Utopian is now being inundated by contributions in this category. This is very cool, but at the same time translations are eating most of the reward pool. This is a temporary change. Will get back to normal once: Rules in the translations category will be enhanced.

On top of their moderators shares they also earn 20% of the contributions reviewed by their team. We Need More Moderators And SupervisorsUtopian is now looking to grow the moderation teams. We need a new supervisor to manage an entire new team for the translation category. We need at least 5 more moderators on the translations category.

Urgent Tasks Before KickStarter - React Devs","text":"DetailsUtopian.io is looking for 2 or more React Developers to join urgent development streams, necessary ones before launching the Kickstarter campaign. Bounties available. Moderation Functionalities - 1 React DevIn order to be ready for the possible pick in contributions after launching the Kickstarter campaign, Utopian.io is looking to improve the moderation system. 1. Cross-Editing. $500 worth of Steem + Utopian upvotesModerators should be able to edit: - a. Repository - b. Categories, even from contributions to task requests. - c. Tags. The API already supports cross-editing. The functionality needs to be integrated in the contribution details, StoryFull component by integrating inline editing functionalities for mods. 2. Quality Slider + Questionnaire: $800 worth of Steem + Utopian UpvotesOn every contribution (not task requests) Moderators should fill a short questionnaire, made ad hoc for every contribution category. By filling the questionnaire a quality slider will be set. The questionnaire should make 80% max of the quality slider, while the remaining 20% can be set freely by the Moderator. The Utopian bot vote will then use the quality as a main factor for calculating the voting weight. Requires integration with API and edits on the API. Another developer will take care of the API changes. Moderators should never be able to approve or reject a contribution without first filling the questionnaire and consequently only after having set the quality slider. Related Task: Moderation should not also be able to reject or accept a contribution without having successfully added a comment before. The functionality needs to be integrated in the contribution details, StoryFull component, on the moderation modals/alerts when accepting or rejecting a contribution. 3. Pending Timeout: $450 worth of Steem + Utopian UpvotesIn the contributions details a moderator should have a button to set the contribution as pending. A contribution should be pending for no longer than 1 hour. If the moderator does not either accept or reject a contribution within an hour, the contribution will be set to pending false. Requires integration with the API. A node developer will take care of that. On the contribution details the frontend should be constantly checking if a contribution suddenly became pending and alert another moderator that may be viewing the same contribution that another moderator is on it. 4. Moderators Activity: $650 worth of Steem + Utopian UpvotesOn every profile of every enabled Moderators, there should be a tab to see which contributions a Moderator has rejected/accepted/pended, sortable by date “since” and “until” and by status rejected/accepted/pending. The API should be ready for that. May still require further improvements. ComponentsEdit Post, Moderation functionalities on StoryFull component, API integration DeadlineMonday 5, February 2018 Github Issues and More - 1/More React Dev/sThere are some minor and major bugs affecting the Utopian.io Frontend. We should clean the github issues feed and do some more enhancements. 1. Clean Github Issues: $1000 worth of Steem + Utopian Upvotes Clean the Github issues on the frontend https://github.com/utopian-io/utopian.io/issues You may need help in cleaning this feed and share the bounty. 2. Open Website to Public: $300 worth of Steem + Utopian UpvotesUtopian.io is now only accessible if you are logged in. The site should be open back again and only redirects to join.utopian.io if the user logs out. Requires checking SEO issues. May require changes to the API. A node developer will take care of that. 3. Cookies, TOS and Privacy Acceptance: $500 worth of Steem + Utopian UpvotesUtopian.io will soon become a SRLS, the equivalent of a LTD. We need to make sure users accept Cookies. We also need to make sure the users should accept terms of service and privacy regulations if they have not done that yet. TOS and privacy policies will be given to you in specific pages. Cookie acceptance should happen be on join.utopian.io and utopian.io. The cookie plugin should remember if the user has already accepted the cookie policy. Will require changes in the API. One node developer will take care of that. 4. Login Redirect: $150 worth of Steem + Utopian UpvotesWhen logging in a modal should show up and explain briefly what SteemConnect is and redirect to SC within 3 seconds. Contents to write in the modal will be provided to you. 5. Wallet From Busy.org: $200 worth of Steem + Utopian Upvotes Integration of the wallet from Busy.org. Utopian is a originally a fork of Busy.org. 6. FAQ: $350 worth of Steem + Utopian UpvotesCompletely refactor the FAQ page using an accordion. Requires integration and changes to the API. A node developer will take care of that. Contents of the FAQ will be provided by the backend in the form of an array of objects. ComponentsLanding join.utopian.io, Login / Logout Procedures, Auth verification on front and API, New sections for TOS, Privacy Policy, Wallet, FAQ.

We couldn’t be happier! Utopian.io is working hard to resume accepting CrowdIn translations as soon as possible and we will work directly with CrowdIn to scale the moderation process. Utopian Support for CrowdIn ContributionsContributors will be happy to know Utopian.io will apply the best possible short term solution to re-enable CrowdIn contribution submission as early as next week, while working on long term interoperability solutions, and a deeper integration of CrowdIn contribution and collaboration in Utopian.

English Only and More.","text":"Due to the huge number of contributions and abuses, Utopian constantly improves its rules. We are announcing here another significant update that aims to increase the quality of contributions and simplify the moderation process . Contributors have 48 hours before having to bind to the new rules. Binding To The RulesYou have 48 hours from the date and time of this announcement before having to bind to the new rules. Every contribution that does not meet the updated rules after Friday 2, 6PM CET will be rejected. Significant ChangesBelow the most significant updates. More updates apply than the ones reported on this post, find all the updated rules on https://utopian.io/rules LanguageContents of the contributions will always have to be in english. Tutorials, Video Tutorials and Blog Posts can now only be in english. Dropped CrowdIn SupportDue to the lack of a comprehensive CrowdIn API, Utopian needs to drop its support. Contributions in the translations category will only be accepted when submitted via Github. This may be a temporary solution until Utopian can find better ways to scale in supporting CrowdIn. Affected CategoriesFind below the categories affected by these rules changes and the current requirements. More updates apply than the ones reported on this post, find all the updated rules on https://utopian.io/rules Translations This category is meant only for translations you have created or updated for an Open Source project. You must translate a minimum of 1000 words per translation contribution. Text that is supposed to remain untranslated (links, code, paths, …) or duplicated strings/text can’t be included in the minimum amount of words. You could translate less than the minimum amount of words if the project itself has less to be translated in total. May lead to a lower vote. Entire translations are always preferred. If you are writing about a partial translation we reserve the right to evaluate the actual work. If it is obvious that you can’t properly write in the source language of the translation, your contribution will be rejected. Translations must be provided as a Pull Requst on the GitHub repository. The Pull Request must have been merged within the past 14 days. Updates on Own Projects can be committed directly, without a Pull Request. Commits must not be older than 14 days. Your GitHub username must match that on Utopian. If it does not, you must add your Utopian username in your GitHub profile. You must include every possible detail to check your translation and the tools you have used to translate. Same translations from different authors will be accepted if the moderator can recognise the newest translation has better quality. If the provided translation is obviously machine-translated for more than 20% or has low quality, it will be rejected. Proof-reading is not acceptable in Utopian as a valid contribution. Development In the development category you can submit Bug Fixes, New Features and your Own Projects. Contributions must have a comprehensible commit history. Larger projects or updates submitted in a single commit will not be accepted. Outdated or low quality code can lead to rejection. Generated code or other results of automated processes will not be accepted. Submitted projects must have a unique value. Redundant projects will not be accepted. Trivial code snippets, example code or simple templates will not be accepted. Bug Fixes and New Features must be submitted via Pull Requests. &gt;- The Pull Request must have been merged within the past 14 days. Updates on Own Projects can be committed directly, without a Pull Request. Commits must not be older than 14 days. Bug Fixes for your Own Projects will not be accepted, unless the Bugs were caused by third party dependencies. Your Utopian account must be connected to your GitHub account. Tutorials Video Tutorials must be technical instructions that teach non-trivial aspects of an Open Source project. Design or video editing related tutorials, gameplay, simple on-screen instructions, ubiquitous functions (Save, Open, Print, etc.) or basic programming concepts (variables, operators, loops, etc.) will not be accepted. Your contribution can be rejected if the moderator provides a link to another tutorial that covers the same topic better. You must mention your Utopian username at the beginning of the video. Video Tutorials using a machine voice will be rejected. The video and audio recording must be in HD (min. 720p). You must host the video on YouTube or DTube and embed it in your post. The video can not be older than 14 days. If you provide a text version of your tutorial, you need to include it or a link to it in your post. You can not submit a separate contribution in the Tutorial category. If you create a GitHub repository with additional material (like code samples), make sure to choose the repository of the project your tutorial is about and not your own repository. You can provide links to your repository in your post. Graphics This category is meant only for graphics/videos/motion graphics that you have realised for an open source project. The contribution must be a direct result of your own work. It is strictly prohibited to modify other people’s work/assets or use a template and claim it as yours. T-shirts and merchandising are generally not valid contributions in Utopian. You must include every possible detail in your contributions to verify the work is done by you. A contribution must contain the final file of your work, sample of the work, applications of your work, comparison to the existing product, and benefits of your work to the project owner. Graphics contributions can be delivered in .psd, .ai, .cdr or any other universally accepted file format except logo designs. Those must be delivered in a vector file (e.g. .eps/.svg/.pdf) for flexibility and scalability, and .png file format. Logo design contributions must contain the actual logo (logomark/logotype), the logo in a form of an icon, logo variations in terms of size and colour (monochrome and full-colour versions). &gt;- You can see some examples of good contributions here, here, and here. Any text or fonts must be converted into shapes or “outlined”. You must provide credit to all third-party images/assets you have used in your contribution and make sure that you have permission to use them for commercial use. (images, videos, fonts, 3D models etc.) Intro videos are acceptable only if the project has already had an intro video before and your contributed video is of a better quality. It is highly recommended that you promote your work to the project owner. Banners, header images and other assets for use on social media platforms are not valid contributions at the moment. Designs are preferred to be in a vector format unless the project owner specifies a different format. Bug Hunting In this category you can submit Bug Reports for actively maintained Open Source projects on GitHub. The repository on GitHub must accept issues. Bug Reports for projects in pre-alpha stage will not be accepted. Cosmetic issues, that do not affect the functionality of the software, will not be accepted. You must provide sufficiant detail to reproduce the bug. Add screenshots, video recordings or animated GIFs, if they can help to understand the bug. [SOFT] Include information about your technical environment such as &gt;- Device, Operating System, Browser and Application versions. Bugs must be found on the latest released version of the application. If you or someone else submitted the issue on GitHub first, the Bug Report will not be accepted. Approved Bug Reports will automatically be published on GitHub. Your Utopian account must be connected to your GitHub account.

Contributors interested in submitting new contributions to Utopian should review the new rules prior to contribution submission and must follow them. CrowdIn - Language ProofreadersIn the previous update of the the Utopian Rules we announced only proofreading enabled contributors may submit contributions in Utopian. Upon reevaluation, we came to the conclusion that Language Specific Proofreading capabilities are sufficient. Contacting project owners/managers to be included as a language proofreader in their project is highly discouraged if you have not worked on the project before and you have no verifiable experience as a translator for the specific project. Requesting to be enabled as a language proofreader on a CrowdIn project and mentioning Utopian is forbidden and will lead to a permanent BAN from contributing on Utopian. Note that this rule is temporary, and these permissions are mandatory only until a deeper integration between Utopian and CrowdIn is finalised. We are working closely with CrowdIn to automate and simplify quality verification in the very near future. BlackListContributions to projects listed in the Utopian Repo Blacklist will be automatically rejected. If you wish to add your project to the blacklist, please contact us at info@utopian.io.

BrowserStack allows instant access to multiple desktop and mobile browsers, while supporting great Open Source initiatives. To help the Utopian Moderators team in the review process of bugs and development contributions BrowserStack will provide the team with unlimited manual and automated testing for open source websites and mobile apps, including full platform access to Live, Automate, App Live and App Automate, for a total of 5 user licenses and parallels. It is our hope that this will not only help moderators in their review process of bug-hunting and development contributions, but also lead to future cooperation and collaboration with BrowserStack. CrowdIn.comThe team at Utopian.io has been hard at work in establishing a direct collaboration with Crowdin.com, undoubtly the best translation platform out there. Utopian.io is looking to provide to Crowdin.com with a way to automate rewards for translation contributions on Open Source projects, and implement solutions to improve and simplify verification process. We are proud to collaborate with such amazing project and hope to continue to work closely on internationalization of more open souce projects. Disasterhack.orgWe’ve also been in contact with Distaster Hack, an initiative empowering people by providing access to technology and the skills to utilize it. Utopian.io will offer Distaster Hack support with periodical donations as per the Utopian Charity Program.

Since Utopian.io was originally forked from Busy.org, all we needed to do was just extract the amazing wallet from Busy.org and implemented it in Utopian.io. Contibution Quality Scoring QuestionnaireTo improve contribution approval processes and reward contributors fairly, we’ve implemented a contribution quality scoring questionnaire for Moderators to rate contributions reviewed by them. Using the questionnaire, Moderators can easily rate and score each contribution based on different criteria according to the category of the contribution. Moderators may also award a manual addition of up to 20% of the total score calculation at their discretion. Supervisors may review a questionnaire already filled out by a moderator and make changes to the scores entered at their discretion. In the near future, the questionnaire score will be implemented as a metric for calculating the voting weight of the Utopian bot. Moderation Cross EditingTo solve the most common error in contribution submission, Moderators can now change the contribution category, repository and tags on behalf of the contributor. FAQUtopian.io now offers a dedicated section for FAQs to answer the most common questions about Utopian.io and the STEEM blockchain. The FAQs can now also be accessed non-registered users on the website directly from the Utopian Feed. Profile FiltersContributions displayed on a user profile can now be filtered based on their status. Contributions can be browsed by Reviewed, Rejected and Pending. Moderator Profile FiltersUtopian user profiles designated as Moderator users will now show contributions reviewed by the moderator, and filter them by date and status. Increased Moderation RewardsAs discussed and agreed jointly with the community, Moderation Rewards have been increased with a max cap of 150 SBD per week.

Today, we would like to announce some major changes to moderation processes and assignments, as well as some modifications to the Discord server channel list, member roles and voting distribution. Changes to moderation processes on Discord and assignments discussed in this announcement will come into effect as of April 5th. Platform related features and enhancements will be live by 14th April or earlier. Continuous ImprovementThe organizational changes in this announcement are another step toward a more effective Utopian.io, allowing us to distribute higher rewards to users making valuable contributions to innovative Open Source projects. It is our hope that these changes will lead to more a manageable and scalable moderation process. Welcome The Community Managers!As we reach outward beyond the Steem community, the Supervisor role in Utopian.io will be replaced with a new role: The Community Manager. Specifically selected for this role, based on proven expertise and in their respective fields and dedication to Utopian.io, the Community Managers will take over all Supervisor duties, and receive a few additional tasks and responsibilities. To ensure no category is neglected, every Community Manager will only manage one single contribution category, and the task request category related to it. Initially, the role of Community Manager will be assigned to the following users: @eastmael: Analysis - Tasks Data Analysts @jestemkioskem : Bug Hunting - Tasks Bug Hunters @sachincool: Bug Hunting - Tasks Bug Hunters @deathwing: Tutorials - Tasks Tutorials (New) @mcfarhat: Tutorials - Tasks Tutorials (New) @andrejcibik: Graphics - Tasks Graphics @techslut: Visibility - Tasks Influencers @amobastian: Development - Tasks Development @helo: Development - Tasks Development (nominated, waiting for next onboard) @espoem: Blog - Tasks Copywriting @buckydurddle: Video Tutorials - Tasks Video Tutorials (New) @knowledges: Suggestions - Tasks Thinkers @favcau: Suggestions - Tasks Thinkers @ms10398: Documentation - Tasks Tech Writers @imwatsi: Copywriting - Tasks Copywriting (New) When the need arises, we may seek out additional members of the community to add to this elite team of professionals. Current holders of the Supervisor role (who do not appear in the above list) if selected, will be assigned the role of moderators to join the categories managed by the Community Managers (according to their specialization). Community Manager Responsibilities In addition to managing the activities of moderators and the contribution review processes, the community managers will be entrusted with engaging the Open Source community on various channels as well as collaboration on the shaping of the future of Utopian.io. Engaging the Community Chatting with users and replying to messages on public Utopian.io Discord channels. Providing technical support and replying to help inquiries in the Discord #help channel and the specific #help channel for the category assign (i.e. #review-development). Participating in online discussions and replying to comments on Utopian.io communications and mentions of the brand on social media. Onboarding project owners, including offering online technical support and one-on-one calls. Corporate Collaboration Participating in the ongoing optimization of Utopian rules and other documents and materials required for community management and onboarding of new users and project owners. Participating in weekly management (previously supervisors-weekly) and moderator biweekly conference calls on Discord. Joining spontaneous voice conferences on the community-talk voice and utopian-moderators voice channels on Discord. Finding and working to eliminate plagiarism/abuse on the platform. Moderator Onboarding and Team Management Overseeing the review and moderation of contributions in the category assigned to them. Managing the group of moderators in the category assigned to them: Referring moderator role applicants to take the Moderation Quiz. Verifying applicants’ relevant experience and proficiency in the English language. Communicating relevant information and updates to category moderators. Managing moderator role assignment across platform tools (Discord, Utopian moderator records). Revamped Team StructureAs community managers will be managing the moderation activity in a specific category rather than a team of moderators from different categories, there will no longer be need for team-based Discord channels. These (such as #espoem-team etc) will be deleted. Every Community Manager will only hold responsibility for a single duo of categories (tasks and related contributions) and is therefore the focal point in managing that category duo only and in working with all the Moderators reviewing contributions on that category. As the workload grows additional Community Managers will be assigned to the active categories where additional manpower is needed. However, a Community Manager will never manage more than one duo of contribution categories. Moderator Category AssignmentModerators may choose to review submissions to up to 3 categories. To be nominated for the role of a moderator, applicants must be selected by Community Managers and successfully complete the moderation quiz. Community Managers will pick moderators for their categories from the current team of moderators, and assign them with roles in the category review team. Moderators who have not been assigned by a Community Manager to any category role by April 14th will be removed from the moderator team as inactive. Contribution Rejection and RulesBased on the above mentioned changes, rules will finally become guidelines. Contributions that follow the guidelines will have more exposure in Utopian, while contributions which don’t will always have less visibility. Immediate rejection will only be applied to contributions that clearly ignore the most fundamental guidelines or have been submitted for pure monetary gain. The majority of rules listed on our website will remain unchanged, but will now be considered submission guidelines. Simplifying Discord Roles &amp; Channel StructureTo avoid confusion, we’ll be consolidating Discord user tags and roles. A new role to be added is the role of Community Manages whose role administrating on Discord will include role assignment and onboarding of moderators on the platform. Removed Discord RolesDeemed unnecessary, the following roles will be removed: Admin, Lead Develop, Collaborator and Discord Manager. Other roles removed or updated: Advisors - Engagement with this group of users is moved to a designated channel on the organizational Slack. We believe such a significant role should have a more direct impact on business related matters, which Slack is the most appropriate place. Sponsors - Reserved for investors delegating of over 10K SP. Category-specific roles will remain unchanged, but will be renamed according to category - i.e. translation-mods will become just translation. Removed Discord ChannelsJust as redundant are some channels that will be removed: review-subprojects and #review-discussions. Discussions will take place in category-specific review channels (#review-[category]). Public Poll category - Community polling will take place only during life conferences. utopian-video Discord Managers channel branch All team related channels (such as #espoem-team, podanjr-team, etc.) WOW! We Are OVER 5000!Our Discord server reached and passed the 5K users mark. Thank you all for being part of this community - you make Utopian what it is! Ticketing SystemWhile we aim to keep in touch with all the members of the community via Discord, Utopian is looking to switch to a more manageble and scalable customer support solution. A ticketing system is in place and will be soon be available for public use. Community Managers will be charged with replying to inquiries related to their assigned category, while general inquiries will be handled internally by the Utopian team. Rewarding Spontaneous and On-Demand ContributionsAiming to reduce abuse and increase rewards to valuable contributions, we have gathered all the possible input from all the various parties involved in Utopian.io, including project owners, moderators, contributors, legal consultants and core Utopian members. It is evident that a change in how spontaneous contributions are executed, submitted and rewarded is necessary. Spontaneous ContributionsContributors may continue submitting their contributions to the following categories without having to link any task request: Development Documentation Suggestion Bug Hunting Analysis Tutorials Video Tutorials Blog While linking the submission to task request is not mandatory, it is still encouraged. It is important to note that while spontaneous contributions will be accepted and rewarded, attempts at abuse will not be tolerated and abusers will be banned permanently from submitting content to Utopian.io. On-Demand ContributionsTo reduce abuse and cater to the needs of project owners on Utopian.io, some categories will now access contributions that are linked to a Task Request. Graphics - Project owners’ assets, that are often copyrighted, cannot be published or used without explicit permission from the owner of the assets. To preserve contributors from legal issues, this category is now on-demand only. Translations - Following massive abuse of this category, all translations must now be on-demand only. Visibility - As per regulations is numerous countries, no promotion should ever happen without the project owner request. This category therefore must be on-demand only. Copywriting - Copywriting work is usually performed when requested by the project owner. Thus, it only makes sense it too would demand a Task Request Contributions submitted for a task request will be shown in the task itself. A convenient system to select a task request is being implemented. Contributors may find the latest task requests on the Utopian Tasks Requests section or on projects-specific feeds. Contributors looking to submit to projects that do not have a relevant task request attached, may NOT contact Project Owners on behalf of Utopian.io without receiving the approval, necessary materials (when applicable) and guidance from the Community Manager of the relevant category.Feed Changes and Review ProcessThe content feeds across all of Utopian.io will change significantly. All the feeds (including home feed, projects related feed, user profiles feed) will show contributions based on the following criteria: One week default selection. Contributions submitted in the last week will be shown by default. Users will have the ability to change the selection. On top of every feed, top scored contributions will be shown. Score is assigned by the Utopian Moderators (via the Quality Questionnaire) and/or by project owners when reviewing a contribution. Users can decide to sort contributions by score ASC or DESC, while DESC is by default. Just after top scored contributions feeds will show lower scored contributions and at the very bottom unreviewed contributions. Users will also be able to filter contributions by their statuses (any, unreviewed, reviewed, rejected, pending). Such changes will assure top quality contributions will always be shown first, while enabling users to better interact with the content on the platform. Unreviewed contributions will show up in the feed and may be upvoted based on criteria explained later in this announcement. This is to eliminate long waiting periods in the review process. Github IssuesWhile we aim to remove completely the concept of “unreviewed” contributions as a metric to enter the Utopian feed, contributions will only be pushed to project Github issues once scored by a Moderator. From Moderation to CurationSince unreviewed contributions will show up in the feed, the work of a moderator is being switched from moderation to curation. The sole responsibility of moderators will be to effectively score contributions by filling out the category-specific moderation score-card. The direct influence of moderator review on the selection of contribution on the value of the reward received will be greatly reduced, as per criteria later explained in this announcement. Scoring a ContributionAdding a score to a contribution can be done by either a moderator and project owner. Scoring is not mandatory, thus not every contribution may get a score. All contributions are immediately rewardable by the community as they enter the feeds immediately without moderators having to accept. The score is used internally by the system to filter contributions in order to have a cleaner database of contents, for the benefit of contributors, project owners and curators. It is true that contributions which have no score won’t ever get an Utopian upvote thus remarking the fact the Utopian upvote is never guaranteed. Moderation RewardsWith the moderation process simplified and moderator responsibilities are clearer and more streamlined, Utopian.io is also looking to adjust the moderator reward model to incentivize curation. The previous model (as per the @utopian.stats account) will remain only for Community Managers while for Moderators there will be switched to the @utopian.tip model. Comments added by Moderators after, having scored and curated a contribution, will trigger a tip to be awarded to the moderator. Tip funds will be generated from the main @utopian-io account, where 5% of the total 20% daily voting power will be dedicated to moderator rewards. Rewards will be given until the dedicated voting power is exhausted on a daily basis. Power to Project OwnersIn Utopian.io we’ve always believed that project owners should have power to decide which contributions should be rewarded. That is where Utopian.io is heading. Project owners will now have nearly full control on what should be rewarded and how. When viewing their Utopian feed, project owners, as explained above, will be able to filter and sort contributions for their projects, with the highest-scoring contributions according to the moderation score-card and a score project owner can set themselves. Score entered by project owners will always have the biggest weight in calculating the voting power. Task RequestsProject owners will be able to mark a contribution received for a task request as the “Solver”. Once a contribution has been set as the Solver, the task will be set as closed and no new contributions for it will be accepted. Marking a contribution as the Solver of a task is irreversible. Project owners can also set a score, from 1 to 100, to mark the quality of the Solver contribution. This score will be used in the calculation of the voting weight, as per the criteria later explained in this announcement. Spontaneous ContributionsProject owners can score and reward spontaneous contributions. This score will be used in the calculation of the voting weight as per the criteria later explained in this announcement. Voting Power DistributionThe following change is possibly the most critical. Voting distribution is going to be changed completely based on the following criteria. Up to 20% of voting power used daily 30% of the 20% daily voting power dedicated to spontaneous contributions 65% of the 20% daily voting power dedicated to task requests marked as winners by project owners Task requests won’t be voted by Utopian, ever, but still votable by the community. Remaining 5% is reserved for rewarding Moderators for their curated contributions as explained above. Voting WeightMax and minimum caps are set for each category. These caps may be changed as the STEEM price changes. Suggestions. 1% min cap. 10% max cap. Bug Hunting. 1% min cap. 15% max cap. Analysis. 15% min cap. 25% max cap. Tutorials. 15% min cap. 25 % max cap. Video Tutorials. 15% min cap. 20% max cap. Blog. 10% min cap. 20% max cap. Development. 25% min cap. 50% max cap. Graphics. 20% min cap. 40% max cap. Translations. 20% min cap. 50% max cap. Visibility. 15% min cap. 35% max cap. Documentation. 15% min cap. 35% max cap. Copywriting. 15% min cap. 35% max cap. The 20% daily voting power will be used until exhausted, meaning that not every contribution will to be upvoted by Utopian. The Utopian Bot will apply the following criteria, to decide what should be rewarded by Utopian itself and what not: Contributions linked to task requests are always voted first in the queue. Spontaneous contributions follow. Contributions with the highest rewards generated before the voting round, will be voted first in the queue. Inclusion in voting round happens after 24 hours of either moderation / owner scoring in order for the contribution to gather enough upvotes. Contributions submitted for task requests will only be voted by Utopian if marked as “Solver” by the project owner. In the case the project owner is accepting his own contribution as the Solver or contributions from any other owner, moderation score will have to be present in order to be selected for the voting round. The balanced average between moderation score and owner score will be used to decide what to assign between the max and min cap dedicated to the category. If no owner score is present, moderation score only will only be taken in consideration. Either the moderation score or the owner score are necessary to enter the voting round. Contributions which have same balanced score, will go first or after in the queue based on the total amount of rewards. The more rewards, the sooner the vote. A contribution may never enter the voting round if one of the above criteria isn’t met or the daily voting power is exhausted before the contribution can enter the voting round within the max 1 week window. Staff PicksCommunity Managers will have a new Discord channel named #staff-picks. They may pick contributions which they believe are of the highest quality. These contributions could be manually voted by Utopian with special voting weights. Staff picks will be promoted in a dedicated section on the Utopian homepage for maximum exposure. Utopian Upvote as Incentive Not an IncomeWhile the Utopian upvote has always been considered as an incentive for contributing to Open Source projects, we have discovered many contributors and moderators have started claiming their rewards as if they were guaranteed income. This is not the case and will never be the case. Getting an upvote or incentive of any kind from Utopian, from now on must be generally perceived as a gift or award only. Being rewarded by Utopian is never guaranteed and only top scored contributions and best curated contents may enter the voting round. We believe community should rely on community members and their stakes, and not only on the voting power held by Utopian. This change in mindset is also necessary to incentivise members to grow their own stake on the Steem blockchain, to seek out exposure, learn, improve and network to get higher rewards from the Open Source community on the Steem blockchain. Community support and engagement is now also a fundamental parameter in entering the reward distribution voting rounds on Utopian, since voting starts from the highest scored and the most community beneficial contributions. Beneficiaries From 25% to 15%To better incentive contributors, the fee deducted from the contribution payout by Utopian.io will be lowered from 25% to only 15%. The beneficiaries division will be changed all cross the Utopian platform including posts and comments, therefore affecting the rewards distributed to contributors, moderators and Community Managers. Sponsors RewardsDue to the decrease in platform beneficiaries fees, Sponsor Rewards will also undergo some fundamental changes. As of now, only the first 4 Sponsors (now called Platinum Sponsors) will receive 10% beneficiary rewards weekly and according to the volume of their delegation. In addition, they will also receive random rewards according to remaining weekly funds. The following 4 Sponsors (5 to 8 on the list), from now on named Gold Sponsors, will receive only random rewards based on available weekly funds. All other sponsors may still receive random incentives based on the available weekly funds. These are not guaranteed. Full DecentralizationAll the above mentioned changes are the result of continuous feedback review and analysis we’re done in the past months. These changes are the first step to a full decentralization of Utopian reward distribution. Contribution rewards have been unlinked from moderators and balanced between Moderators, Project Owners, Community Managers and the community. A team of professional and dedicated team members will offer support and immediate feedback on all the official Utopian channels. Moderation waiting times have been significantly reduced. A contribution that has been scored by moderator and project owner, will be included in the bot voting round queue within 24 hours. Rewards are more predictable and depend on category, PO involvement and (of course) quality. Better, more sustainable voting distribution should greatly reduce the rate of abuse of the system. Quality is now incentivized by upvoting only contributions that receive top scores and are seen as truly beneficial to the community. ## Vote Utopian Witness We are made of developers, system administrators, entrepreneurs, artists, content creators, thinkers.

We Deliver. New Reputation System. New Decentralised Scoring System and Much More!","text":"As part of the recently announced changes, today we are delivering a lot of enhancements to Utopian.io; even more than we promised. A New Reputation SystemWhile we were trying to fix how scoring and voting contributions works in Utopian.io, we realised that the default Steem reputation system does not work well for our purpose. That’s why we decided to create a custom Utopian.io reputation system. Made with Utopian in mindThe new reputation system in Utopian.io takes into account a user’s number of rejected and accepted contributions, in which categories the user has contributed, in addition to the score each contribution has received. This is the perfect fit for Utopian.io because it allows us to measure how well a user is contributing to the Open Source ecosystem, and then translate that into a simple reputation badge. Reputation is dynamicAll reputation values are calculated against the user who has the topmost total score, overall on the platform. As the top score changes, the reputation values also change. Such an approach makes the reputation implicitly dynamic, meaning that: to keep your reputation badge at the same level, you must keep contributing valuably. Reputation badges Newbie Beginner Advanced Expert Pro Ninja Guru Hero Legend Elite Reputation and influenceEach reputation badge comes with a level of influence. The only reputation badge which does not have any influence is Newbie (to prevent new users with the wrong intentions from gaming the system). The influence affects how a user scores a contribution. The bigger the influence, the more weight and validity the user’s scores have when determining the final score of contributions. Reputation badges assigned by default Moderators start with the Reputation Badge Guru. This is to ensure that they have enough influence when scoring contributions. Community Managers get the Reputation Badge Elite by default. This is to ensure that their influence can help maintain the quality of contributions overall on the platform. Specific members who are highly trusted in Utopian.io can get an Honorary Reputation. @scipio @jedigeiss @littleboy and @transisto all received the Elite reputation badge. Power to Project OwnersWhen a project owner scores a contribution received for his own project, independently from the current reputation badge he has, the system will always calculate the influence as a minimum starting from the Guru reputation badge. This is to ensure project owners have enough influence when scoring contributions for their own projects, as much as moderators. Delegate for more influenceIn order to find new ways other than liquid rewards to incentivise delegation, we now allow users to earn a higher reputation by delegating to Utopian, which gives them more influence and ultimately gives them power to decide on the distribution of rewards. Beginner: delegate at least 100 SP Advanced: delegate at least 1000 SP Expert: delegate at least 5000 SP Pro: delegate at least 10000 SP Ninja: delegate at least 15000 SP Guru: delegate at least 20000 SP Hero: delegate at least 25000 SP Legend: delegate at least 50000 SP Elite: delegate at least 100000 SP Decentralised Scoring SystemAs recently announced, we strived hard to find a solution to decentralise the scoring of contributions and give the community the power to decide what’s good or bad, and how the Utopian.io voting power should be used. While we wanted to give only Moderators and Project Owners the responsibility of scoring a contribution, we have realised our new reputation system can allow us to go way further than that. That’s the reason why every user can now score a contribution (which was not submitted by himself). Each user can now answer the questions from the Quality Questionnaire, which before was only possible for Moderators. Influence calculationSince every user has a reputation badge and every badge comes with an influence, that influence is used to define which answers from the Quality Questionnaire received the best ratings. Each answer gives the contribution a certain score, which is then finally used by the Utopian Bot to decide the voting weight. New Utopian botSoon, the Utopian Bot will take into consideration the following criteria, to decide the voting weight: Score: the score assigned by the most rated answers from the Quality Questionnaire. Total influence: the summation of the influence held by all users who have scored the contribution. The Utopian Bot will vote starting with contributions that have the largest total influence, the best score and which were marked as reviewed by a Moderator (or which scored higher than 80). Since the Utopian Bot can only use a maximum of 20% voting power daily, not every contribution may get a vote, making the Utopian Bot vote never guaranteed and only an incentive for top quality contributions. The new Utopian Bot should be released as soon as next week. Projects WhitelistSoon, Utopian.io may only list projects that have opted-in to our ecosystem. In order to get your project in Utopian.io and to have our full support, project owners now have a dedicated landing page. Dedicated Page for InvestorsAs we want to onboard more project owners on Utopian.io, we also aim to bring more investors into the Steem ecosystem. That’s why there is now a dedicated landing page where investors can get in touch with us to get more information! Beneficiaries From 25% to 15%As promised, the amount set aside for beneficiaries from contributions made on Utopian.io has been decreased from 25% to only 15% cross-platform. Changes to moderation teamsIn the last few days, a new moderation setup was implemented and Community Managers have begun working. They took up the responsibilities of Supervisors along with other duties, and were tasked with picking a maximum of 3 moderators each for their respective categories. During this transition, some moderators were not assigned to any category and have been disabled from moderation as a result. We would like to thank them for their hard work and support, and apologize for any inconveniences caused. We would like to assure them that we will consider re-enabling their roles in the future, as the need arises. We hope to see all of them discussing and enjoying the community on Discord. Moderation FunctionalitiesAs part of our effort to improve moderation processes, we have added some enhanced functionalities. Better moderation controls Moderation controls look nicer and easier to access, while providing more functionality than ever before. Reserve a contribution To avoid instances of moderators working on the same contribution at the same time, moderators can now reserve a contribution for one hour while working on it. No other moderators will be able to reserve the contribution during this time. Staff picksStaff Picks are contributions which our Community Managers believe are of outstanding quality. Staff Picks will get higher exposure and higher rewards on Utopian.io. API Usage LimitOur servers are currently overloaded by what we identified as bots. These bots have full access to our API without any kind of limitation. We have just impemented an API proxy which controls the limits of requests. In order to get an API key for your platform or bot, please send us a ticket.

We have exciting updates coming up that will help project owners better manage their Open Source projects on Utopian.io. An opt-in bug report feature for GitHubWe realized that project owners needed to be more involved in the contribution processes, especially bug reports. Therefore, to prepare for our upcoming whitelist opt-in feature made for project owners, we have currently stopped all bug reports from being sent to GitHub as issues. The whitelist feature will enable project owners to opt-in and start receiving bug reports directly into their repositories as issues. We want to encourage close collaboration between contributors and project owners on the platform, and we believe giving project owners more control over this aspect will be beneficial. As they would have their projects officially present on Utopian.io, they can also leverage the other features we have to really control the development of their projects.

The team consisted of our CEO @elear, our CMO @techslut and our Lead Developer @wehmoen. our CEO @elear and Lead Developer @wehmoen in London The next day was spent discussing Utopian.io matters and how to improve the platform. We also took some time to go around London seeing places. The main eventThe show was held on Saturday, 14th of April and from 9AM speakers talked about the Steem blockchain and pitched many amazing Steem projects to the audience. @wehmoen recorded the presentations and you can find the video here. After the presentations, people visited stands for the various cryptocurrency projects represented at the show. Steem had a beautiful stand showcasing all the wonderful projects we have. a picture of the #promo-steem stand We Offered Free/Immediate STEEM AccountsA lot of people were interested in Utopian.io. We collected contact details of more than 20 investors willing to get a Steem account from us. We discussed Utopian.io and the Steem blockchain in every possible detail. Overall, the event was a great success! Utopian Biz CardsWe have been given away dozens of business cards, almost 100. We got in touch with project owners, investors, developers, content creators, willing to understand the amazing functionalities of our platform and how they will be able to benefit from it. New Collaborations On The Horizon!We met so many amazing Steemians over there and new interesting collaborations just started right away. @RoxaneWe have invited @Roxane to meet us at the event. @Roxane is probably the most active Steemian in the French community. She is just great. She has wonderful social skills and experience in on-boarding new users to the platform. That’s the reason why we proposed to @roxane to become one of our core members! @Roxane will take care of on-boarding new project owners in Utopian.io by fully managing the process, from the lead acquisition, guidance and on-going support. @Promo-SteemWe have been discussing with @Starkerz how our projects could collaborate and came up with some exciting ideas. Utopian.io is willing to offer to @Promo-Steem the possibility to create accounts right away through us. The Guys From @Promo-SteemWe can’t thank enough these guys for how helpful they are and for how well they have organised the entire event. Their work was just amazing!

Getting an Utopian UpvotePrior to this update, only contributions which were marked as accepted by a Utopian Moderator could enter the voting round. Now, contributions with a score of at least 80 and a total influence greater than or equal to that made by one moderator, can enter the voting round. Contributions are only eligible for the voting round 48 hours after submission, for them to gather enough scores from the community. This spreads the distribution of influence more between all Utopian users, rather than having it concentrated among Moderators alone. Factors for an Utopian UpvoteThe Utopian Bot now considers the following factors for entering contributions into the voting round. 1. Staff PicksContributions which were marked as Staff Picks by our Community Managers always enter the voting round first and they are the first ones to be voted. They are an example of top quality and serve as guidance for the community. Such contributions always get the maximum upvote possible based on the categories they are in. 2. Top Scored with Highest InfluenceJust after Staff Picks, all the other contributions may enter the voting round. The order starts with those that got the best scores and where the scores were made by users with the biggest influence overall on the platform. The list goes on sorting contributions according to their scores and the relative influence associated with them. Voting Power Is LimitedCategories no longer have a minimum vote, only a maximum vote as detailed below. The Utopian Bot can only use 20% of its total voting power, in a day. As a result, not every contribution may enter the voting round, making the Utopian.io vote an incentive only for top quality contributions. The Utopian vote is thus not guaranteed for every contribution. Maximum Vote Strength for CategoriesThe Utopian Bot will vote on contributions with different voting strengths, depending on category. Every category has a maximum limit. Suggestions: 5% Development: 30% Bug Hunting: 8% Translations: 20% Graphics: 25% Analysis: 25% Visibility: 15% Documentation: 15% Tutorials: 15% Video Tutorials: 20% Copywriting: 15% Blog: 15% Task requests: 4% The values reported above are subject to change as the value of STEEM changes. Utopian.io is inviting the community to help decide the maximum voting strengths for each of the categories above. Take our survey now! Moderation RewardsAfter restructuring our moderation teams, we turned our attention to their reward structures. They too needed adjustments to reflect the skills, expertise and commitment that Moderators bring to Utopian. After collecting feedback from all our Moderators and Community Managers, rewards for moderation activities have been increased as follows: Suggestions: 2 points per review Development: 4.25 points per review Translations: 4 points per review Graphics: 3 points per review Documentation: 2.25 points per review Copywriting: 2 points per review Tutorials: 4 points per review Analysis: 3.25 points per review Visibility: 2 points per review Blog: 2.25 points per review Video Tutorials: 4 points per review Bug Hunting: 3.25 points per review Task requests: 1.25 points per review The maximum weekly cap has also been increased to 250 points.

This post explains how it all works and why we should score contributions. Scoring Is for EveryoneAs part of our efforts to decentralize the platform, encourage users to network with each other and give the community more influence on the distribution of rewards, we recently introduced the scoring feature. This allows every Utopian user to score contributions. To support this capability, we also introduced reputation to the platform. A Unique Reputation SystemEvery Utopian account now has a dynamic reputation assigned to it. This reputation is calculated by using various metrics to measure the quality of the contribution you make on the platform. That is then weighed against that of others, with every reputation also weighed against the account that has the highest reputation value. With this, users are encouraged to contribute well in order to maintain their reputation levels in relation to other user’s activity. The level of reputation you hold on Utopian also affects the influence of your scoring. The higher your reputation, the more your scores affect a contribution’s ranking and rewards. Reputation LevelEvery Utopian account has a reputation level from the ones listed below. Newbies have no influence yet on the platform (to avoid potential abuse) and have to contribute until they get to Beginner, which has the least amount of influence. Elite holds the highest amount of influence and is gained through consistently making high quality contributions. Community Managers have this level by default, in accordance with the responsibility demanded by their positions. Moderators start off at Guru. Newbie Beginner Advanced Expert Pro Ninja Guru Hero Legend Elite What Affects Your Reputation and HowTo increase or maintain your reputation, you will need to continuously make high quality contributions. The more valuable contributions you make, the higher your work is scored, and the higher your reputation goes. Quality contributions: these affect your reputation positively. The more highly scored contributions you make on Utopian the better your reputation becomes. Your scoring activity: scoring other contributions will have a beneficial effect on your reputation as well. Rejected contributions: contributions are rejected for violating fundamental rules and this lowers your reputation on the platform. Steem Power delegation: sponsors are also assigned reputation levels according to how much Steem Power they delegate to Utopian.io. How to Score ContributionsFind Contributions to ScoreVisit the contributions feed by clicking on Contributions in the side panel or by clicking the Utopian logo in the top left corner of the screen. You can filter your feed by category. Choose a category from the list on top of the contributions list. (as seen in the image below) Click the Score IconOnce you find a contribution you want to score, open it by clicking on its title. This will bring you to the its content page. You will find a blue score button to the right of the contribution’s title. The number shown there is the current aggregate score. Click the button to view the questionnaire. Answer the QuestionnaireTo begin scoring, answer the questionnaire as accurately as you can. The answers you pick will be used to calculate the final score given to the contribution, so choose carefully. To see how other people have scored the contribution, click Most rated. Leave a CommentAfter scoring a contribution, you are encouraged to leave comments with appreciation, tips or suggestions for the contributor and the community. Utopian will be on the lookout for high quality scoring and those who leave insightful and valuable feedback will get random fat upvotes on their comments.

To improve the scoring system, we created new and improved questionnaires for all categories. Streamlined questions, answers and scoring weightsThe score a contribution receives from the community depends on the answers selected in the category-specific questionnaire. The questions crafted needed to not only be relevant and cover all the various aspects used to review a contribution’s value to the project it is made for, but also clear enough for the community to rate fairly. Both questions and answers needed to work in cohesion to measure value. For this, we had to use a completely different approach in formulating questions and answers, and the weights they have on potenial contribution rewards. Well-Balanced Scores and WeightsIn all categories, we redesigned questions and answers to make sure that the scores and weights associated with them correctly evaluated contributions. Community Managers shared their expertise and experience in crafting the questionnaires that were then edited for uniformity and clarity across categories. Clearer and More Relevant QuestionsAll the content in the questionnaires was edited to ensure that the wording was clear, relevant and consistent. Questions were compacted to cover the important aspects of review and to make the contribution scoring process easier to understand. What This Means for ScoringThe actual scoring process itself has not been changed. The changes applied were to the content only. For more information on how scoring works, read the detailed post we recently published on the topic. The new questionnaires were designed to improve the scoring process and we anticipate that this will result in more accurate evaluation of contributions on Utopian. Studies We UsedOur team utilized various studies to compose the most relevant questions, answers and associate scores to each. In formulating the spread of scores among the various questions and answers, lessons where taken from these two studies: Tilmann Gneiting &amp; Adrian E Raftery (2012) Strictly Proper Scoring Rules, Prediction, and Estimation, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 102:477, 359-378, DOI: 10.1198/016214506000001437 Staël von Holstein, C.S., 1970: A Family of Strictly Proper Scoring Rules Which Are Sensitive to Distance. J. Appl. Meteor., 9, 360–364. The ideas we found helped us to create a better distribution of scores, while making sure the questionnaires encourage people to be careful and honest, with accurately defined levels/measures of quality. An Important Milestone on Our RoadmapThe mass of platform upgrades introduced in the past weeks are creating a foundation for a robust evaluation system that will allow for the curation and organization of all of the community’s contributions. The reputation system we integrated is our first attempt at building a powerful and intelligently designed review system for Utopian.io. It’s a major iteration of the first few steps Utopian.io is taking to mature out of beta; and realize its vision of creating an Open Source Economy. Got comments?

[EDIT]Rewards from this post will be donated to Busy.org / SteemConnect for their help in stopping the attack. The AttackThe attack started yesterday. It was initially identified as a service disruption only, but it appears that wasn’t the case. Our main production server was completely erased. Our CDN, which contained files and backups, was erased . SteemConnect Tokens were leaked from our DB and today used to bulk downvote/upvote random posts. NO WALLETS OR KEYS WERE COMPROMISED OR WERE EVER IN DANGER OF BEING COMPROMISED DURING THE ATTACK. The incident was resolved and all the tokens were permanently revoked. Was my wallet or private keys compromised?No. No private data was leaked and your wallet was not at risk at any point. What can one do with a SteemConnect token?Only basic actions like posting and voting, but never transfers of funds, delegations etc. Can this happen again if I use SteemConnect to login another app?The Utopian application database was leaked due to a successful hacking attempt on company servers. The leak was not caused by any security issue in SteemConnect and you are totally safe to use SteemConnect in the future. For more information: https://steemit.com/steemconnect/@busy.org/automated-votes-abuse-on-steemconnect Do I have to change my password?No passwords or keys are stored by SteemConnect or Utopian. This attack does not demand you change your keys or passwords. Is the issue over? Can my account be misused to vote random posts?Yes the issue was resolved and existing SteemConnect tokens revoked. No other operations can be broadcasted with the leaked tokens. Is the hacker or hackers responsible being traced?We are making efforts to trace and investigate the source of the attack and are checking all possible leads. Working in cooperation with the team at SteemConnect, our hosting service providers, and making use of all available forensic tools, we hope to pinpoint the source of the leak and take legal action against the perpetrator. What Now?To ensure your account was not misused, and to undo whatever actions were taken with the use of your token, please go to https://steemd.com/@youraccount and check if any vote was broadcasted without your consent. If so, please revert the vote/downvote. Within the next few days, we will publish interim guidelines on contributing to Utopian while we restore normal operations.

As we focus on developing a robust and scalable Utopian.io, our curation team will continue to seek out, review and score contributions to be rewarded. Currently, Utopian is adopting a curation framework that was tested by many curation initiatives on the steem blockchain, and offers higher rewards and more freedom to the Utopian contributor community. While we continue our journey in rewarding quality contributions, the Utopian.io frontend will initially be restored for moderation purposes only. Utopian.io was born seven months ago as a one-man mission to create an open source economy to empower open source projects and contributors worldwide by utilizing the power of the steem blockchain. Many blocks on the blockchain were signed since then, and in those short seven months, Utopian.io turned into a brand, and a successful initiative attracting contributors, open source project owners and investors. Moreover, it became an organization and a community - decentralized, driven and united behind a common goal - doing good for open source. Utopian.io is not a platform or a frontend - it’s an ideal. With the recent unfortunate security breach to our servers that caused our users’ authentication tokens to be compromised, it was obvious Utopian has grown beyond the framework it was initially built on, both technologically and in terms of organizational processes. The current Utopian.io frontend will require multiple audits in terms of security and scalability as we focus on the development of a solution to better suit the community and its needs. While we build a better Utopian.io interface for you, the resources and power entrusted to us by our delegators will be used to keep doing what we have always aimed to do - reward quality contributions. How Can I Submit Posts for Curation by Utopian?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S1AtrzYY1Q&amp;feature=youtu.be While there is currently no dedicated frontend for contribution submission, our activity in incentivizing and rewarding high-quality contributions to the open source ecosystem will continue through manual curation by our team of moderators and community managers. You can create and submit posts using your favorite steem interface (steemit.com, busy.org, esteem, etc.) and they will be reviewed and rewarded. TagsAll posts tagged with the main tag #utopian-io and the target category tag, will be reviewed by our team, and the selected contributions will be upvoted (as previously) by the @utopian-io account. It is important to note that only contribution submissions that adhere to Utopian Posting Guidelines and are correctly tagged will be reviewed. To ensure our team finds and reviews your posts promptly, please use a secondary category tag for your posts as detailed below Contribution tag Category Tag Suggestions ideas Development development Graphics graphics Bugs bug-hunting Analysis analysis Visibility social Video Tutorials video-tutorials Tutorials tutorials Copywriting copywriting Documentation documentation Blog blog Task Request tag Category Tag Tasks for Bug Hunters task-bug-hunting Tasks for Analysts task-analysis Tasks for Influencers task-social Tasks for Designers task-graphics Tasks for Developers task-development Tasks for Tech Writers task-documentation Tasks for Copywriters task-copywriting TemplatesContribution submissions and tasks are reviewed if they are correctly tagged, structured, detailed according to the category template, and adherent to Utopian Posting Rules and Guidelines.

Every contribution may wait up 72 hours before being reviewed and eligible for an Utopian upvote. The submissions are scored according to predefined questionnaires, and only contributions that receive the highest score will be added the voting round. Posts submitted to the Utopian tags will not be “accepted” or “rejected”, but instead may receive moderator comments with valuable feedbacks. The top posts will be upvoted from the daily queue, rewarding the contributions with the highest value to the community as quantified by the moderation scoring criteria. If your post was not upvoted during the first 72 hours, it is safe to assume it did not qualify for a reward. Zero Beneficiaries:Thanks to our users being able to freely choose the platform they want to post from, Utopian will not enforce any beneficiaries on these submissions, essentially allowing them to earn 15% more for their contributions. We are hoping this can further encourage our users to spend their time and invest their skills in contributing to open source projects. Sponsors RewardsTo ensure weekly sponsor payouts are remain unaffected, we will be using our curation rewards instead of beneficiary rewards to distribute the sponsor payouts. Utopian Looking Forward:While it is easy to see this shift to manual curation as a step back in user experience, we strongly believe that this small step will enable big leaps forward. With our focus shifted from supporting and maintaining a flawed application, we can allocate our resources towards the development of a new and improved Utopian at a pace faster than would otherwise be possible. While development is ongoing, we will keep engaging the community on Discord and incentivising the Utopian team to do so as well. Among others, we are planning to launch a series of teaching sessions and webinars, as well as a content magazine, topical curation digest and other exciting surprises. We want to turn this unfortunate event into an opportunity to move forward and reboot Utopian as the paradise it is meant to be for Project Owners and passionate open source contributors. On behalf of everyone at Utopian, we thank you for your continued support in these challenging times, and invite you to share your insights and ideas with us on our Discord server.

The speed at which moderation and reward distribution activities were resumed in Utopian, their involvement and passion about the project are truly inspiring and are undoubtedly our biggest strength. Today we are happy to be sharing another set of updates our team was able to develop and deploy in record speed and efficiency. New Utopian BotThanks to @amosbastian our new Utopian bot is live and voting. It was developed fully with Python for maximum speed and scalability. It has some new cool features, while maintaining the best functionalities of the previous bot. Voting PowerThe new bot does not begin voting until its voting power is charged to 99.9% power, and casts a new vote every 5 minutes. This allows us to ensure the vote is fair for every contribution, without having to consume the power down to 80%. Voting DistributionThe score assigned by a moderator remains the most important metric for the bot to decide the voting weight along with the age of the submission. The highest scored contributions will always be voted first as long as there is available VP. The new bot is Open Source: https://github.com/utopian-io/utopian-bot New Review SystemThanks to the amazing work of @ms10398 the new https://review.utopian.io was born. This helper tool allows Moderators to properly and easily score contributions based on a very specific and well thought set of questions, defined and worded by some of the best professionals on this blockchain. TransparencyAfter receiving feedback from the community asking for transparency on the assigned score, we’ve launched the new https://review.utopian.io service. It allows moderators access to a public page URL that contains in it all the questions and answers picked during the review, for the contributors to note to improve their future contributions. The review tool is Open Source: https://github.com/utopian-io/review.utopian.io New Tipping BotMeaningful and constructive comments are important to the Utopian community. We would like to recognize and incentivize the most valuable comments left by our Moderators, CMs and community members. Thanks to amazing work of @ms10398 we now have https://tip.utopian.io. Community Managers can use this tool to assign a significant 1% tip by the Utopian bot to exceptional comments left by Moderators and community members. We hope this will incentivize the community to provide the best curated content that may be of value to others as well. The Tip Bot is Open Source: https://github.com/utopian-io/tip.utopian.io Translations are Coming BACK!We have been working hard to come up with a new framework to resume the review and rewarding of translation contributions. We are working with a professional team of translators in creating a workflow and review system to make it possible for you to resume contributing in this category. Stay tuned for an upcoming announcement in the coming weeks! UtopyWe believe our community deserves only the best of the best. For this reason we are trying to provide everyone with the best tools and materials to become better Open Source contributors. Recently added to our team is an experienced social media manager and Open Source enthusiast, entrusted to provide our Discord community with valuable Open Source materials, Utopian freebies and open teaching sessions in our community chat server. To ensure this account is directly associated with Utopian, we’ve decided to use the opportunity to adopt a mascot, and we’re reaching out to the community to help us design Utopy, the Utopian mascot.

Growing and rewarding the Open Source community on the STEEM blockchain was, is, and will continue to be the Utopian vision. The main hurdle on our way to realizing this vision was a lack of account creation system to allow for immediate contributor access to Utopian services. Having to wait for an account on Steemit, or purchasing one for immediate use was detering many Open Source projects and contributors from joining the community. Today, we are changing that. We are proud to present to you the Utopian STEEM registration module to make STEEM account creation seamless and FREE for GitHub users. PLEASE NOTE: This service is intended only for the creation of new STEEM accounts for GitHub users who do not currently have an active STEEM account. Accounts accidentally created by existing account-holders on the blockchain will be disabled through undelegation in regularly performed audits. UpdateSince many existing STEEM users are expressing their will in testing the new Utopian signup module, the actual account creation has been temporarily moved to the testnet. You can now test it freely! We will resume creation in the main net in the next few hours. Utopian SignupThe Utopian Signup module allows Open Source contributors to instantly create a STEEM account by syncing their GitHub account with Utopian and confirming account ownership. Originally developed with the help of @therealwolf the Utopian Signup module is fully Open Source: https://github.com/utopian-io/signup.utopian.io Secure, Fast, ReliableThe Utopian signup system uses a unique algorithm to verify past social data on GitHub and verifies user authenticity. 5000 STEEM for NewcomersWe’ve powered up 5000 STEEM allocated to account creation with @utopian.signup . As demand rises, we will be powering up additional STEEM as necessary. If past activity data on GitHub allows for instant verification, the user will only be asked to enter an email address to get a free STEEM account instantly. Personal data, like the email address, is fully encrypted and only processed for verification purposes. SMS VerificationIf the past activity data on GitHub isn’t enough to verify the authenticity of the user, SMS verification will be requested in addition to email verification. The phone number provided for verification is encrypted. A verification code will be sent to the number entered and used to continue the registration process. Password SafetyOnce the user has verified either the email and/or the phone number a password will be presented on screen. The password is generated client-side and destroyed immediately after the account creation for maximal security, which also means it’s not recoverable. The user will be requested to save the password locally in a TXT file before being able to proceed. The user can now choose the preferred STEEM username and finalise the account creation. MissionWe hope that with the launch of the Utopian Signup module, we will be able to accelerate the growth of both Utopian and STEEM, while providing the best user experience possible. With this tool, we will be able to launch advertising campaigns and community initiatives to attract a mass of Open Source project owners, contributors and investors to Utopian and STEEM. To us, this is a great leap forward that will have a profound impact on creating the STEEM-Based Open Source economy that is our vision.

In This Post: Utopian Signup Module Development updates Utopy Internal Guidelines Welcoming New Moderators What’s next Utopian Signup ModuleOne of our most awaited releases and major achievements as a growing company on the Steem blockchain is the Utopian Signup Module we launched this week. With the Utopian Signup Module, anyone with a GitHub account can create an instant and FREE account on the Steem blockchain. We’re currently running the service on a test network to ensure it is secure, free of bugs and abuse-proof before taking it live. We look forward to using this module to bring more Open Source developers to Steem and rewarding even more contributions to inspiring projects. AutomationIn order to simplify and scale our processes, we have integrated a number of new automation systems to allow the team to properly verify, review and reward contributions. Utopian BotBuilt in Python, the Utopian bot spots contributions already reviewed by our moderators, and sorts them by the highest score based on the review results generated on https://review.utopian.io Utopian TipsAiming to incentivise and reward insightful quality post comments from our moderators and community members, we have built a tipping bot. These comments will be manually selected by Utopian Community Managers and will receive a significant 1% upvote from the bot. We hope this will inspire you to share your valuable insights with Utopian contributors. Utopian UnvoteTo mitigate moderation mistakes and wrongly scored and voted contributions, the unvote bot spots contributions that should be unvoted and unvotes them. Review TransparencyOur Moderators have been provided with a predefined comment footer containing a link to the review metrics used by our Moderators when scoring a contribution. The contributors can use this information to improve the quality of their work. UtopyWe’ve received multiple contributions to our task request to create Utopy, our Discord presence and mascot. It was no easy choice, but here’s our winner - this adorable design by @podanrj. The official launch of Utopy on Discord is planned for tomorrow (Saturday) at 6PM (GMT +3) and you are all very welcome to meet him for the very first time. Internal GuidelinesTo ensure all communications between our team and community are professional and cohesive with the company views, we’ve released an internal Team Handbook. In addition to a list of tools and resources for moderators and community managers, the handbook includes standards for replying to contributor tickets, leaving insightful comments and providing feedback to other community members. Sneak peek We hope that these guidelines will help streamline and unify the communication between the team and community across all channels. Welcome Our New Moderators!Growing demand for additional moderator to the Development and Bug Hunting categories led us to add three new moderators to our team. Say hi! @emrebeyler - an active and well-known developer in the Steem community. @gregory - an amazing developer that works, among others, on the development of Busy.org. @achiron - an experienced QA expert.

It is the community of contributors, moderators and community managers that make Utopian what it is. In this weekly series we’ll introduce you to some of these amazing people and this week we begin with one of our most active community managers: @jestemkioskiem I’m not really much more special than any of you - a young student with a passion for coding. Plenty of our users are far greater open source contributors, others are better developers, you get my point. We at Utopian are just a part of the bigger picture you’re in as well. The only difference between us is that we sacrificed everything to be here, and I encourage you all to do the same with your lives. Take risks, do what you love, never stop at good enough. That’s how you find places you truly belong to. How long have you been involved in Open Source projects? Do you own / manage one or more of your own? And where does Utopian.io fit in? Hmm… Truth be told - I didn’t do much in the Open Source space before Utopian. I loved the movement, I used it for learning code, but I hardly ever contributed. I wish I could, but I was not even barely good enough! When Utopian came around and I could suddenly do what I love and help support myself at the same time, my development skills got better and better every day. I would absolutely not be even a junior developer today if not for Utopian. I do have plenty of projects of my own that you can find on github.com/jestemkioskiem, sadly all of them have been abandoned now due to time constraints, although some are working products even if the code is a little messy (a lot of people message me about SockoBot still). I’m hoping I can go back to my Steem Assistant interface soon, but only time will tell! What does your professional skill-set offer the Open Source community and what type of contributions do you usually submit? Back when I was a moderator, I used to contribute a lot. Mostly to my own projects, but I always made sure they were useful to the community of Steemians. As of now, I only ever contribute if I’m already doing something I or my friends need. That’s how my latest posts to Utopian, the Alexa JSON generator and EOS tutorial came to be. I already have my next project in mind though, and while it didn’t even cross my mind to bring it to Utopian until now, I think you guys will love it! Which programming languages / platforms do you feel most at home with? If you ever read the Discord’s general chat when I discuss code, you’ll know I’m all for Python. I’ve tried almost every modern language by now, but no other grinds my gears like my good old snake friend. That being said, a lot of people don’t know I really enjoy C# too. I learned it as a kid developing simple games and it stuck with me ever since. I love Unity, I’m just not all that about Game Development right now. And while I definitely don’t feel at home with javascript yet, I’m trying. Hopefully by the end of the year at least a single line of code in Utopian will be authored by me! How did you discover Utopian? What made you want to take part? I think I’m in the minority when I say I remember exactly how I discovered Utopian. I came to steem back in late 2016, thanks to @dailydogger (who I can’t thank enough). At the time the community was still growing and I was really not all that into blogging - I’m still not! The opportunity to do stuff like we do here was not there, and that made me burn out quickly and leave. I came back in mid 2017 to post my thoughts to #polish, but I was still looking for opportunities. One day, I saw @steeminator3000, an old friend of mine, post a translation to a project via Utopian. The moment I saw it, I knew this was awesome. My comment is there, you can read it, something along the lines of “Woah, that’s awesome, never knew you did this!”. I researched Utopian and decided to tag along for the ride. I was always proud of my English skills and I could never utilize them before then, so this was an opportunity to help, earn &amp; feel good about myself! What made you decide to take on additional roles in the organization itself? Back when I was still all about translations, I used to see contributions with bad grammar or made with little to no effort to cash in in my language. I’ve asked around, but there seemed to be no polish moderators at the time. It felt unfair, not to me who put in actual effort, but to the project owners who would later use this and be laughed at. That’s why I asked @ruah to join his team, and I couldn’t be happier about the fact that I did. I saved dozens of projects from terrible translations and loved every second of it. How do you see the future of Utopian? What would you want it to be, and where would you like to see yourself in it? I think Utopian is far too revolutionary, the idea is way too good and the team working here is too passionate for the system to fail. I see Utopian as a future viable alternative for freelancers and a fantastic place for people that are just entry level in their field. This place is great for learning and improving yourself - it’s truly an Utopia for young, passionate people. As per project owners, I can’t imagine projects not joining us once we make our systems fool proof and advertise to larger groups of people. It’s like hiring a freelancer, but for free (or not if you wish to provide a bounty), and it’s all open source. Right now I’m pushing for an option to set beneficiaries to make 100% of your post rewards go to charity. I think this is a very important step for people that want to come to us from Github and continue to do the same, for free, just with their passion. I would love to see myself in the picture. Internal decision making and researching interesting system implementations (like I did with the Questionnaire) is really my thing! I might get burned out in the PR field, but even then I’ll find a place for myself here. I’m not leaving until you guys make me! What other steem communities / initiatives are you part of? Lately, not many. I still call myself a “Polish Community Activist” in my profile, which hopefully leads you to believe I browse and curate #polish. Other than that, I unfortunately rarely have time to engage in the other ones. I know this is going to sound very narcissistic of me, but I think #polish is one of the best communities on the website. These guys chat on daily basis, have their own rules, even started their own SteemCleaners for just our tag. It’s structured, shitposts don’t make it far, there’s a wide range of quality content there. It really melts my heart to look how far we’ve come since I came back there last year, when only 1 person (huge shoutout to @noisy!) was curating the content. If I see an opportunity to join a similar community, you’ll find me there. Also, expect me on DTube sometimes this summer! What is the most interesting / weird / inspiring thing to personally happen to you on the Steem blockchain? The weirdest thing ever was becoming a Supervisor here. I don’t think I’ve ever told this story, so get ready for some exclusive content. On one of our Bi Weekly meetings, @elear openly admitted that new Supervisors were needed and that the team will need to expand. He said he’s taking in the candidates. I was still new on Utopian, maybe 3 or 4 weeks by then, but I messaged him to ask - “How would I go about becoming a Supervisor in the future? I’m still new, but I love it here, I’d love to have more impact.”. Innocent question about how the team structure works here and what qualities I should aim for to hopefully get an opportunity later down the line. This lead him to ask on voice if anyone had anything against me becoming a Supervisor. No one spoke up. I changed my life by accident. I’ve learned to always take the shot. You miss all of the ones you don’t take.

These rules offered a binary view of “approved” and “rejected”, creating an unnatural dichotomy between what was rewarded and what was rejected. After weeks of hard work involving the community managers, company advisors, moderators and (of course) community feedback Utopian.io is ready to ditch the rules and adopt a new set of Utopian.io Policies &amp; Submission Guidelines. This new approach, combined with the process of scoring the contributions submitted (instead of approving or rejecting them), will allow for a more flexible and scalable process of reward distribution. In addition, we took the opportunity to rework the guidelines for specific categories, and refine the rules for better readability, as well as a visual redesign (by @ms10398) of the Utopian.io Policies &amp; Submission Guidelines page. From Rules to Policies &amp; GuidelinesA Utopia does not need “rules”, as such, and so we believe every contributor should be free to contribute to whatever open source project they wish in whatever way they like. That said, it is our primary goal and vision to incentivize and reward only the best contributions that bring the highest value to projects and the open source ecosystem overall, and to be able to continue doing so in the future. Policies for ParticipationEvery platform or service in the world has a set of policies in place aimed at protecting the service from potential harm (such as lawsuits or negative brand reputation), its services from abuse, and its users from a negative experience on the platform. As part of the switch from rules to submission guidelines, we’ve separated and emphasized the importance of policies, such as those for code of conduct, content originality, copyright issues and cases of abuse. Regardless of your intention to submit contributions, it is critical that you get acquainted with the policies as your continued participation in Utopian depends on your adherence to them. Guidelines for RewardsAssigning a numeral quantifier to perceived quality of contributions submitted is a harder task than one might think. That is the reason why we’ve worked tirelessly to create synergy between professionally composed guidelines and effectively designed scorecards for each category. This way, we can compare the quality of contributions not only against said guidelines, but also between the different contributions in the category, according to their score. As previously announced and emphasized, rewards or incentives from Utopian.io are never guaranteed even if all guidelines are followed. The rewards are distributed, as previously announced and detailed, to the highest scoring contributions in every category, rather than to all “approved” contributions (as previously done). It is our hope that this change in view and mindset will lead to an ongoing growth in the quality and quantity of contributions submitted and rewarded. Category Specific ModificationsAlong with the switch in mindset, this update includes a few much-awaited changes to specific categories. CopywritingAs mentioned in previous posts and Managers Weekly calls, contributions in the Copywriting category are now only eligible for rewards if they are made in response to public requests by Project Owners. These include Task Requests made on Utopian.io and other verifiable forms of public requests such as website announcements. GraphicsTo ensure only the most valuable and professional work is rewarded, and to prevent potential abuse and negative experiences of Project Owners with this category, contributions in the Graphics category are now eligible for rewards only if they are bound to a public request from the Project Owners or linked to a Utopian Task Request. VisibilityIn addition to Influencer Task Requests, contributors wishing to be rewarded for their efforts can now promote their favorite projects found in the Utopian.io Visibility Whitelist, to have their contributions scored according to guidelines. We hope this opportunity to freely set campaign goals, select audiences and optimize the ad message will let our contributors fully employ their skillset as professional marketers. Project Owners may apply for addition to the whitelist by contacting the Visibility Moderation Team in the influencers channel, on the Utopian.io Discord server. Video TutorialsTo be eligible for reward, video tutorials instructing “foundation level” concepts can now be submitted only by contributors who have submitted more than 20 professional quality contributions in the past. In a nutshell, foundation level concepts are unique to an Open Source project, straightforward in complexity, and in required learning for all users of the project. We hope that supporting foundation level video tutorials will provide learners with thorough learning resource collections for Open Source projects. So who gets upvoted by @utopian-io?The best, most significant and valuable open source contributions submitted for scoring are the ones that enter the voting round to receive an upvote from @utopian-io. The best way to ensure your contribution receives such an upvote is to follow the Utopian.io Policies &amp; Submission Guidelines and exceed the performance of others. In addition, exceptional excellence is rewarded through Staff Picks. A handful of contributions selected by Utopian.io Community Managers on a regular basis will receive the highest reward for the category and serve as an example of stelar work. Utopian.io (still) RULES!Utopian.io will continue to change, improve and evolve for you and with you.

In the regular Utopian Weekly posts on Fridays, we’re happy to share all the latest Utopian news and updates. In this update: New Utopian V2 Frontend sneak peaks Utopian Signup Module improvements New undelegation bot Bug fixes @utopian.tasks task resteem bot. New branded versions of tip.utopian.io and review.utopian.io Utopian Landing Page improvements Revamped Contribution Guidelines page Stay tuned for more! Utopian V2 Frontend Sneak PeeksWe are working hard to bring back a better, scalable and secure version of our frontend. Thanks to an amazing collaboration with @hernandev, we are building the foundation for the new frontend. The new frontend will store no tokens from SteemConnect and on top of that, client tokens will always be encrypted for maximum security. It is built with Vue.js and the Quasar Framework. Sneak PeeksThe feed Contribution details .png) Comments Upvotes Utopian Signup Module ImprovementsBefore we began using the signup module to onboard new Utopians, we worked hard at debugging and improving it. This week, we fixed multiple bugs and added a few important features. A completely new system to avoid abuseTo save the dedicated Steem Power we have from abuse as we create new accounts, a new flow has been implemented. If you are a great contributor with a well-established GitHub account, the registration will be instantaneous. The signup will only require email verification, following which your account will be created. If your Github account isn’t immediately verifiable, you will have two options: Insert an invitation code. Invitation codes can be requested via our Discord server. Proceed by email and sms verification. A manual verification will be done in this case and an account will only be created after approval. We are confident these changes will make the signup much less likely to be abused. The new signup system is now working on the mainnet and creating accounts for awesome Open Source contributors! Invisible RecaptchaAn invisible recaptcha has been implemented to mitigate potential bots and improve the security mechanisms of the signup. We are also working on implementing IP, email, and virtual number filters. Such security measures are essential to avoid any potential abuse of our Steem Power and to ensure that we use it only to create genuine accounts. Un-delegation BotSteem accounts created through our new signup system receive Steem Power delegation from Utopian.io to begin contributing and participating in the community. To encourage users to be active on the platform and on the blockchain, and to ensure no Steem Power is wasted on unused accounts, we will automatically retract the delegation 45 days post account creation. This bot (coded in Python) is made available thanks to the efforts of @amosbastian. Bug FixesThe improved signup module instantly checks if the username already exists on the Steem blockchain, and throws a more understandable error to highlight this fact. Other minor issues relating to checking username format have been resolved. Utopian.tasks Resteem BotIn an effort to showcase task requests submitted to Utopian.io and scored by our team, @amosbastian wrote a bot to resteem all valid task requests to @utopian.tasks. Outstanding task requests will also be resteemed by the main @utopian-io account for maximum exposure. Branding of our Team’s ToolsTo give tip.utopian.io and review.utopian.io a more user friendly and Utopian-themed look and feel, @ms10398 reworked the page design and added our official graphic branding elements. Landing Page ImprovementsIn order to make our curation efforts more accessible and easier to understand, we have updated our landing page at join.utopian.io. New Login ModalA new login modal now pops up when clicking on Login on the landing page, to give newcomers useful options for the different frontends they can use to contribute to Utopian.io. Contribution GuidelinesThis week we have finally switched from Rules to Guidelines. You can forget the word “rules” which has been so critical in Utopian so far. You can now contribute freely, as long as you provide quality work. You can follow our guidelines found on join.utopian.io/guidelines to learn about the best practices to follow in your posts for improving your chances of receiving a high score and getting rewarded. The same new Guidelines Landing Page has also received significant updates, making it much more readable and accessible, as seen in the screenshot below. Stay tuned for more!We are creating a lot of educational material to help teach the community how to contribute and provide the quality work we expect on the platform. Follow the new account @utopian.edu to be the first to access all of our free educational content, covering all categories. The very first video tutorial in the series is planned for release TOMORROW! Don’t miss it! Content PlanThanks to the amazing work of our PR department, which includes @techslut and @imwatsi, we were able to come up with a lot of new interesting content, as well as a final content schedule. We have kickstarted: The Utopian Weekly, with updates on our progress The first People Of Utopian , with interviews of active and influential members of Utopian The Top of Utopian, with highlights of staff picks and statistics on contributions The Utopian Mag.

Who are you, Nepeta? On Github: https://github.com/Ominousness Professionally, I’m a web developer, but I’m not afraid to dabble in lower-level matters like kernel development or cryptography. I love electronic music and I’m an amateur EDM producer myself. My favorite producer is Porter Robinson, AND I admire him not only for his looks (although he’s hot) but for his musical experiments. Something that may not be a popular opinion over here, but I love Apple. Their attention to detail is astonishing and they are not afraid to protect users’ privacy. How long have you been involved in Open Source projects? Do you own / manage one or more of your own? I’ve been involved in FOSS for almost a decade now. It all began with my switch to the GNU/Linux operating system. Currently, I manage a few projects that are recognized in their respective niche communities (mostly /r/jailbreak). One of them is a music visualizer tweak for the jailbroken iOS 11 (https://github.com/Ominousness/MitsuhaXI). It started out as a fork of an older project. What does your professional skill-set offer the Open Source community and what type of contributions do you normally make? I try to focus on making projects useful for me and I’m happy when they are of use to other people. So I am mainly focused on creating new projects designed for myself and hoping that the code will help other, less experienced programmers. I will include requested features as long as it doesn’t break the core features of that project. I also take time to submit fixes to other projects to improve them (although usually for my personal purposes). Which programming languages / platforms do you feel most at home with? The majority of my personal projects are developed in Ruby. My (closed source) Discord bot runs on Ruby and discord.rb. My (also closed source) file hosting software works on Ruby, Roda and Sequel. I plan to open source these projects soon. I also have some love towards the new Ruby-inspired languages like Elixir and Crystal. My Elixir projects are available on my GitHub profile (linked above). Java has been useful to me with some more advanced projects thanks to its extensive community support, and JavaScript with smaller ones. Currently, I am working on an experimental Bitcoin Cash-influenced (memo.cash service but integrated as a feature) cryptocurrency in Java. How did you discover Utopian? What made you want to take part? I discovered Utopian quite recently when I was looking for a way to sign up for Steem. Utopian’s signup module was running on testnet, but I was lucky to be offered an account by the CEO (@elear) on Discord. I love explaining the logic behind my projects and sometimes the explanations will help other programmers (like StackOverflow and random programming blogs helped me), so Utopian.io was a good fit. My first contribution was a post about figuring a way of getting a dump of iOS audio buffer and granting access from sandboxed app to that dump. I hope the explanation is detailed enough to let other people make use of it. https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@nepeta/developing-ios-tweaks-a-case-study-of-fetching-system-s-audio-buffer-from-sandboxed-processes How do you think Utopian affects your relationships with the Open Source community and ecosystem? I have yet to contribute enough to Utopian to claim it had any impact on my relationship with the community, but it definitely made contributing more enjoyable for me. It feels really motivating to see my contributions to unknown niche projects being rewarded. The Utopian community inspired me to start planning a tutorial series to be published soon to Utopian.io. Are there any particular projects on Utopian you’re a fan of? SteemPay is interesting. I love how SteemPay achieves what other cryptocurrencies have been striving for. Dead simple payments with no fees thanks to the power of the Steem blockchain. I believe that Steem and SteemPay will become the uncontested leaders in cryptocurrency microtransactions. Simpler and cheaper than PayPal. Can’t wait for the widespread adoption. What is your favorite thing about Utopian? My favorite thing is people finally being rewarded for their FOSS contributions. This is been an issue for the longest time, with only the biggest contributions rewarded through bounties. How do you see the future of Utopian? What would you want it to be, and where would you like to see yourself in it? I’d love to just stay a contributor. Believe I’m not fit for a community management position. I hope to see Utopian become a big foundation akin to the Linux Foundation. Utopian getting some influence on FOSS projects would be a nice addition to the ecosystem. I don’t claim that the FOSS world should be more diverse, but shaking the current order is something I’m looking forward to.

Who are you, @imwatsi? I’m a 27 year old creative writer, and I mostly write poetry, but I am passionate about blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Steem introduced me to the “attention economy” side of the cryptocurrency space. I only knew Bitcoin, Ethereum and the like, prior to Steem and just the idea that people’s attention can be monetized through cryptocurrency blew my mind. It also opened up my mind to thinking outside the box, as I have met and read the content of critical thinkers here on Steemit as well. Discovering Utopian.io gave me a new passion: Writing content that helps people understand how to use products based on Open Source technologies. On Github: https://github.com/imwatsi What is your relationship with Open Source and what made you a Utopian? The term Open Source was for a long time unfamiliar to me and I only got to hear of it when I discovered Bitcoin and all the other cryptocurrencies. That was in 2014. Still then it was more of a mystery. When I discovered Steemit in 2016 though, I began learning more about Open Source and other related things because a lot of people on the site spoke about it. It was on Steemit that I discovered Utopian.io and that was when I started understanding Open Source so much more. I’ve been involved in Utopian.io since the first few days of its inception. It exposed me to a lot of behind-the-scenes work that takes place in many of the projects and how they came into being. How do you think Utopian.io affects your relationships with the Open Source community and ecosystem? How does it help you express your passion for Open Source? Firstly, Utopian.io helps me understand more about Open Source in general. I am always discovering new projects and innovations that I otherwise wouldn’t have, and in that sense it aids in project discovery. Then there is the opportunity to be a part of the ecosystem as a whole and to aid in its development, and that connects with a lot of values I love and respect. Currently, in addition to being the Community Manager for the Copywriting category, you do a lot of behind the scenes work on Utopian.io content. What made you decide to take on additional roles in the organization itself? I started out doing copywriting for Utopian.io’s first landing page when it was released. Afterwards, I decided to start writing help content for the platform during its first few weeks of existence because I saw a need for that content. I really liked the idea behind everything and I wanted to help out as much as I could, within the scope of my abilities, so the best way I found was to write content that helped even more people to get acquainted with and start using the platform efficiently. So after pitching the idea to @elear, I started working on the Help Center for Utopian.io (https://github.com/imwatsi/utopian.io-help_center), which included Quick Start Guides, FAQs, Tutorials and a Knowledge Base. I recently decided to take on additional roles in the organization because I love what it stands for and believe in its vision. Playing my part to fulfil that vision with my skills is fulfilling. What is your favorite thing about Utopian.io? My favorite thing about Utopian.io is how welcoming the community is, and was when I first joined. My skills were valued and I quickly found my place. I really want to see it become a fully released product. I honestly can’t wait. How do you see the future of Utopian.io? What would you want it to be, and where would you like to see yourself in it? I really hope Utopian.io continues to evolve until it creates the Open Source economy it envisages. My role in it might change over the course of time, but I would still like to be involved, be it with day to day activities or every now and then.

With these resources, FOSS Project Owners can access the professional services offered by our community (such as graphic design, QA, visibility and copywriting) FOR FREE. The Utopian.io VIPO Club is a unique initiative both on our blockchain and in the Open Source ecosystem. We hope that by offering this service, we can help connect Project Owners with the contributors they need, and incentivize the efforts made. Professional QA and Software TestingAs you may know, there are a few paid services out there that offer software companies access to a database of beta testers. Most of these services have an entry fee or recurring payments to maintain the service. Image credits: medium.com With Utopian.io, FOSS Project Owners can access a HUGE database of beta testers waiting to help you spot bugs in your software, from critical to minor ones. All, with zero monetary investment from the Project Owner. Project Promotion and VisibilityOne of the major issues FOSS projects face is the lack of resources and manpower to market the product when it is ready for market. Image credits: medium.com Utopian.io allows project owners to employ the power of the crowd and the expertise of seasoned marketers to increase popularity and bring more attention to worthwhile FOSS solutions. Professionally Crafted Graphic AssetsThe creative graphic artists on Utopian.io are waiting to make FOSS projects look better, allowing every Open Source Project Owner access to enterprise-grade talent at zero cost.

It was conceived with the intention to create a New Open Source Economy, and facilitate a fair rewarding system that could be integrated in Github and similar Open Source platforms. Over time, Utopian has changed and evolved both as a platform and organization. However, our goals remain the same: incentivizing stellar quality contributions to open source projects and the Open Source ecosystem. Having reviewed many thousands of posts, we’ve learned a lot about how we can incentivize and prioritize quality above all. To emphasize that, we’ve integrated a scoring system that may have lowered the quantity of contributions, but has undoubtedly contributed to an overall rise in quality. Even though rewarding fewer contributions may lead to loss of potential income for Utopian.io, we see the long-term impact of the changes made to Utopian.io incentivization policies as a significant step toward building the Utopian.io that will serve the needs of the Open Source community best. As we continue to learn and grow, we make sure to stay attentive to you, our community of contributors and open source project owners. Your insights are always welcome, as we strive to reach and empower even more Open Source projects we can introduce to Utopian.io and the Steem blockchain. Opposing BidBotsUsage of bidbots is not a new topic of discussion in the Steem user community. Utopian.io and other initiatives striving to promote quality content on the blockchain are engaged in constant battle with bidbots that seem to be taking over the blockchain to allow for users to maximize profits on expense of the quality we, moderators, community managers, curators, contributors and genuine curation initiatives fight hard to maintain and promote. As of today, Utopian.io will no longer incentivize or reward the development or promotion of for-profit Steem bidbots. Note that Utopian.io will continue to support and incentivize the development of ethical non-profit Steem voting bots, and similar open source initiatives that have clear and convincing policies in place. In addition, Utopian.io may also exclude contributions upvoted by bidbots from being considered for potential reward.

Get involved today!","text":"The Utopian.io team is happy to announce the relaunch of the translations category! We’re looking forward to incentivizing the localization of Open Source projects via Crowdin by our international community of contributors who’ve been patiently (but eagerly) waiting for the translations category to be made available. From its inception, the translations category was the most active category on Utopian.io. This is unsurprising considering the global and multinational nature of the Steem blockchain. The sheer volume and diversity in contributions made it impossible to moderate while maintaining a standard of quality to be of value to FOSS projects. For that reason, we were forced to pause activity in that category. After months of intensive planning, negotiating, and reiterating the guidelines and procedures for the category, we are finally ready to resume incentivizing top quality translations submitted to FOSS projects via the CrowdIn translation platform. We hope this will help engage the diverse and multinational community of professional translations already on Utopian.io, as well as attract new translation professionals to the Steem blockchain and Utopian.io. Collaboration with The Davinci InitiativePart of the Utopian.io mission is supporting initiatives that bring value to innovation on the Steem blockchain and beyond it. We do so by using the power entrusted with us by our sponsors to grow the number of curators committed to our mission. With that in mind, and with the need for a professional and scalable solution to the issue of the translation category moderation, Utopian.io has entered a collaboration with the DaVinci Localization Curation Initiative. Meet DaVinciDaVinci is a curation initiative (and Steem community witness) aimed to provide quality translations to valuable content posted to the Steem blockchain. Comprised of a team of professional translations, and managed with well structured organizational hierarchy, the DaVinci team will have full ownership of the management of the translations category of Utopian.io. This includes on-boarding verified translators, managing moderation and scoring the translations made via the CrowdIn platform by Utopian.io contributors. The team at DaVinci are being onboarded and guided on Utopian.io workflows and policies, and are being equipped with all the tools and resources necessary to make this collaboration a success on all fronts. Want to become a translator with Utopian &amp; DaVinci? Here’s How!Unlike the previous translations workflow on Utopian.io, the new workflow will require whitelisting and pre-approval of all translators whose contributions may be considered for reward. To ensure everyone is rewarded fairly, DaVinci employs a unique rewarding system that splits the beneficiary rewards between Utopian.io (5%) and the DaVinci initiative (10%). To get whitelisted with Utopian.io and DaVinci as a pre-approved translator, you should apply on the DaVinci Discord server. Languages Accepted (more languages will be added in the next weeks): Spanish German Chinese Italian Greek Utopian.io Category RewardsValid translations submitted via CrowdIn and posted on Utopian.io, will enter the queue to receive an upvote from @utopian-io according to the score assigned by DaVinci moderators. The maximum voting cap for the category is set at 25%. To ensure the reviews are transparent, fair and the reward is proportional to effort and quality, the DaVinci team were provided a customized scoring system developed by Utopian in coordination with the core team at DaVinci. Submissions Opening!The DaVinci team will start reviewing your applications immediately. Actual contributions in the category are scheduled to be started on 17th of June 2018!

On Github: https://github.com/onozasi How did you discover Utopian.io, and what made you a Utopian? I discovered steemit long before the birth of utopian. I was still familiarising myself with writing good blog posts, and trying to get more readers to see my publication by advertising my content across different discord channels. I could see a lot of bias when it comes to rewarding quality content on the blockchain. To be able to get more visibility, one has to be a whale, have whale friends or be forced to use bid bots, which I personally believe to be very harmful to the Steem blockchain. One of my ways of dealing with that was getting involved with the @curie initiative as a community curator. I still believe this initiative is a great service to the community of newcomers to the blockchain. Then, I discovered Utopian.io and become one of its first adopters. I read about utopian while going through some articles on the steem blockchain, and it’s day I will never forget. I dived into the utopian discord channel immediately after reading the article. I met very few contributors there at first, but as their number grew, so did my understanding of how utopian works. What really made me want to take part was Utopian’s mission and vision to reward open source contributions. I found this really fascinating. What experiences do you think shaped your presence on the blockchain? When I first signed up for steemit, it felt like I was standing in the middle of a desert with no clue on what direction to go. While still exploring the community, I joined a lot of discord channel to seek for more knowledge on how the community functions. Gradually, I started to make some friends and it was really interesting because I got to learn new things from them, and how to improve. A big shout out to @inquiringtimes who helped in proofreading most of my articles before I published them. I was able to start writing better articles with her help. The most interesting and inspiring part of it is that we have never met before but she took her time to guide and make me understand the ethics of the community. This influenced me a great deal in my participation on the blockchain and in Utopian. How do you think Utopian affects your relationships with the Open Source community and ecosystem? How does it help you express your passion for Open Source? I must confess that utopian is one of the greatest thing that ever happened to me and the open source community in general. I was not engaged with the open source world in my work or life, but with the birth of utopian, my love for it began to grow enormously. I began to familiarise myself with the open source world and tried to contribute as much as my skills would allow me. Utopian has helped me learn new things which have affected me positively in many significant ways. With the birth of utopian, I started a new project (which is currently under heavy development). This project is aimed to incentivise great article writers and people to post about what they have professional passion about. I believe that as long as we have people posting about things they truly have passion about, we will create a new repository for great articles and written content on the blockchain. What made you decide to take on additional roles in the organization itself? I decided to take on additional roles in Utopian and become part of the team because I strongly support and believe in the mission and vision of the organization. The company had helped me personally so much and in so many ways, so taking on more roles allows me to express my love, support and gratitude to Utopian for having such a positive impact on me and others. In all honesty, I am no different from other contributors. I just happen to be in a position where I represent them, help and guide them to do what is beneficial to the projects they contribute to, and to them personally. It is my hope that this way I can contribute to them having the same experience with Utopian as I have - one of learning and growing. How do you see the future of Utopian? What would you want it to be, and where would you like to see yourself in it? I see utopian as a big gift to the open source world. Though we are still very young, I believe in the potential of the vision and organization. Utopian started about 9 months ago and today it’s one of the most successful communities on the Steem blockchain. With the current cure team, I believe utopian is destined to keep growing stronger because it has some really dedicated individuals that aim to see the success of the project. Every core member sees the project as if it is their own, and they handle it with great respect and care.

In this update: The VIPO Program Translations Category Developments Utopian.io V2 Sneak Peek Utopian.io Innovation Trail updates, Community Activities and more… The VIPO ProgramOpen Source Project owners have a hard time finding contributors to their projects, nor can they perform all the functions necessary for a project to become a success. Project Owners aren’t bug hunters, marketers or copywriters, nor should they be. In an aim to make these FREE services provided by Utopian.io and its community of global talent easier to access, we’ve created the Very Important Project Owners Club. Members of the VIPO Club get exclusive access to a growing set of tools, services and professionals to aid their efforts on Utopian.io. We received dozens of applications for membership in the VIPO and the number is growing. Seeing project owners engage with our Community Managers and with each other on Discord is a sign that this service is more than necessary in the Open Source ecosystem. Translations Category DevelopmentsThe DaVinci collaborationUtopian.io has collaborated with the DaVinci initiative on Steem to support the translation of Open Source projects. We have put up a new front-end specifically for this, which can be found at https://davinci.utopian.io. This last week, we also implemented the back-end features to support the site. A lot of work went into creating quality questionnaires and defining the guidelines and policies for the translations workflow. In the last week, the Utopian.io core team worked closely with the DaVinci initiative to finalize the collaboration the framework in which this program will work. Welcome @rosatravels and @jmromero!We have a new community manager for the Translations category, @rosatravels, who is now working in liason with the DaVinci initiative. Together with @jmromero will be interacting with the Utopian.io community and ensuring smooth operations in the Translations category.

Bringing her diverse skill-set, thirst for knowledge and passion for helping others to Utopian.io and the Open Source community, Rosa is our star this week in People of Utopian. On Github: https://github.com/rosatravels Who are you, @rosatravels? I am not a tech person although I can pick up a lot of computer skills easily for building my own websites. As a professional passionate teacher, I help promote Open Source work to my friends by teaching them how to use some of the Open Source Projects I find useful. Currently, my main focus is Utopian.io and our new initiative with @davinci.witness to bring back the translations category. It’s very time-consuming, and even sleep is hard to come by nowadays. But believe it or not, I actually do a have a life outside of Utopian. I love to swim, so whenever I can and the weather allows (which is quite often in Hong Kong), I go to the nearby beach that is only a half hour walk from my home, and swim in the ocean. I also teach the Bible because it gives insights to truth and freedom we all need. The most exciting thing that happened to me was the fulfillment of a dream (after many years of searching): learning to play piano by ear. Being involved in a piano forum with other passionate pianists around the world when internet started back in the 1990s helped a lot. The realization of that dream would not have been possible without the Internet. Amusingly enough, I never learned to play the piano professionally, and yet I now have the opportunity to teach many students online, old and young alike, to use my creative method of Color Chord Improvisation to play by ear. So when people around the world tell me that they are super excited to have found me, it gives me a lot of satisfaction as I know exactly where their struggle is in playing piano, and finally can help all students to play piano in the flow! Another one of my passions is traveling to meet new people and discover different cultures, which is what initially brought me to Steemit. How did your love of travel end up bringing you to Utopian? I initially came onto the Steem blockchain in August 2017 to share my travels with the world. My hubby and I have traveled to all corners of the world and created many DVDs (when they were a popular medium) documenting our trips to Greece, Israel, Turkey, Italy, &amp; Egypt. Our travels always brought us to these places, time and time again, so we re-visited some of these locations 3 or 4 times already, and have never gone tired from what they have to offer. I have a hobby piano website, but I was searching for a way to share our travels and so I discovered Steemit. As you may have guessed, this is also how I picked my username @rosatravels. But now rosa doesn’t travel anymore. Utopian took over very quickly after I joined Steemit, and I have not been able to blog much about my travels. Still stuck on the hot air balloon rides in Cappadocia. I am a firm believer that Steemit is a great platform for all bloggers. This is the reason for me powering up SP to help grow the Steeemit community, and I highly recommend others do so as well. I delegate some of that SP to help other communities. This is how I became a dolphin, and my goal is, of course, to someday become a whale. I find that using your power to help the community is as gratifying as using your skills to do so. This is what I have been doing in the past year and it has been very rewarding. Worry about the money later. Now is the time to give, give and give until the Utopian and Steemit communities get established with our communal SP. How did you discover Utopian.io, and what made you a Utopian? I discovered Utopian at its early stages in October when I saw people translating Utopian posts into different languages. At first, I had no idea what it was all about, but these posts kept appearing on the trending pages that I started taking notice of it. I wanted to take part because I saw that Utopian had a grand vision to promote an Open Source Economy. I have used so many Open Source solutions for free that I felt the desire to give back to the OS Economy with my skills. I joined Utopian.io in October for the fun of it, contributing to Utopian with whatever skills I had in an aim to help the platform grow. It was a game for me to test my skills to see whether I could reach the quality standards Utopian set. These standards helped me strive for my best in all my contributions, regardless of the potential reward. The communal spirit in the organization is truly inspiring as we all want Utopian to go global and see it shine. What was your relationship with Open Source before Utopian? I started blogging in 2006, teaching piano online, which led me to build my own website and use FOSS tools to share my work. 7 Zip was the first open source project I used because I needed to zip up all my video courses for students to download. I also started writing Kindle books and learned how to use the fantastic Calibre Open Source software to format ePub books. This led to 2 years of providing formatting services to other Kindle authors. Kindle then led me to being an online instructor at Udemy &amp; Skillshare where I started creating valuable business courses and music courses on that platform. This is where I learned how to create fantastic audio using the Audacity Open Source software. When my Circle of 5ths Level 1 Course went live at Udemy in 2011, it hit ‘best seller’ within a month, and until today, 7 years later, it is still my best selling course. This led to the possibility of starting my first Open Source Project on this fascinating Music Tool. I am still thinking about how to develop this project today with some friends. How do you think Utopian affects your relationships with the Open Source community and ecosystem? How does it help you express your passion for Open Source? I had no idea what the Open Source community and ecosystem were before I became a Utopian. I am still learning. But as I watch Utopian grow, I am very much inspired by what this Open source community can be, and the potential it has. I do a lot of local voluntary work in translation and production of tutorials to my students, so I like the opportunity to offer my skills to FOSS projects related to volunteering and education outside HK, taking my contribution global. What made you decide to take on additional roles in the organization itself? I used to just contribute as a user, but as I took up more responsibilities as moderators or CM to mentor contributors, I am glad for this great opportunity to help other people grow and develop their skills in translation and tutorial production. How do you see the future of Utopian? What would you want it to be, and where would you like to see yourself in it? The future of Utopian look bright. This small seed of initiative is going to grow into a giant tree for everyone worldwide to take shelter under. I am glad to be a part of this inspiring movement. I am also excited about Utopian.io having room for non-developers like me, who can contribute to the Open Source ecosystem in different ways. Steem is the home for many apps aside from Utopian. Which are your favorite and why? My favorite one is eSteem app especially the new eSteem Surfer. Next in line is Busy. Steemhunt is the new kid on the block, but I don’t know how much time I can invest there, now that I am fully involved in the DaVinci Platform. What other Steem communities / initiatives are you part of? Any you would like to create? I help out in Steem communities mainly by invitation or by chance. I got to know the Chinese community, serve as a Reviewer in the Smartsteem community, contribute photos to the steepshot community and I help translate the ongoing eSteem tips and updates for the Chinese community so they they know how to use the eSteem surfer and app. Just this past week, I experienced the wildest adventure of my life - joining the DaVinci team to rebuild the translation category for Utopian.io so that we can create an international community of professional translators helping Open Source projects go global. When I accepted the CM role at Utopian and CLM at DaVinci last Sunday night, I had no idea what I was in for. I never heard of DaVinci before this time, and suddenly on Monday morning I found myself diving deep into the ocean of the DaVinci organization. And guess what? I survived! I feel that we are now surfing on the beginning wave as the translation activity goes live today, June 17th. For the past week, we dedicated 24 hours (or possibly more) each day as we went through 133 applicants for 20 different languages. The first wave includes only 5 languages (Greek, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, German) with 5 Language Moderators and 15 Translators on board. If I had known such a result was expected from us, I might have been too scared to even accept this role. Sometimes, ignorance is bliss. Just take the challenge and flow with it. It is great fun watching the resurrection of translations on Utopian.io today and knowing I have a role in it. This last one isn’t really a Steem initiative, but one that could help me personally if created. My hubby loves to eat at home, so I try to find ways to put different dishes on the table without repeating the same thing every day. Luckily for me, whatever I put on the table, he loves to eat. I try to be more creative in searching for new recipes, but I still feel I lack the makings of a good cook Can Utopian help? Maybe we need to create an Open Source Utopian Restaurant!

New Staff &amp; Team GrowthWelcoming @roj and @abh12345 as Community ManagersThis past week brought on some team role changes. We would like to welcome @roj as a new Community Manager for the Blog Posts category, and @abh12345 for Analysis category! Operational Manager &amp; PR ManagerWhen Utopian.io was originally incepted, most of the company functions were filled by one (superhuman) man - @elear. As time has passed, and our user numbers grew it became clear that there is need for some well-organized delegation of responsibilities. Two new additions to the core team of Utopian.io are @espoem and @deathwing. @espoem, who will be stepping down from his role as the CM of the Blog category, is now our new Operational Manager who will be handling nearly all managerial tasks and coordination of company activities with @elear. @deathwing will be stepping down from his role as the CM of the Tutorials category, and will be focusing on working along @techslut in our content and marketing team as the Public Relations Manager for Utopian.io We hope these role assignments will help make processes and communications more efficient, as well as create new avenues for the ongoing growth of Utopian.io as a company. Moderation rewards bonusTo encourage and incentivize our moderation team, from this week onwards, every moderator who reviewed at least 5 contributions will receive an extra 30 point bonus to their weekly moderation reward payout. Copywriting, Graphics and Visibility guidelinesThese categories’ guidelines has been updated with the following. To be eligible for rewards, contributions without an associated task request or whitelist entry should show a public and appropriate communication process between the Project Owner and the contributor, with an indisputable level of voluntary Project Owner acceptance of the work done. Contributors can initiate this communication on public channels to propose their work as long as they don’t act on behalf of, or attempt to represent Utopian.io in any way. This means that contributions made to these categories will be considered for reward if clear, professional and public communications between the project owner and contributor can be included. Collaboration with EU Commission We’ve been in touch with the The Blockchain Competence Centre of the European Commission and have agreed on a collaboration between the Centre and Utopian.io. We are excited to be involved in the development of their blockchain-based ledger system, The European Financial Transparency Gateway. For more information you can read their post here.

Though he dubs himself “unlikable”, those who work with him know him as helpful, professional and (almost secretly) fun. On Github: https://github.com/espoem Who are you, @espoem? I am a 24-year-old man who has been studying in Computer Science field. You may ask “Why he has only so little knowledge about open source?” or “Why is he not engaging in the development process?”. The truth is that even though I have knowledge needed in the field, I was not yet able to fully utilize it. I could say that I did not want to slow the development down as it required immediate actions to unexpected events. Still, new technologies and writing code are of my hobbies and interests. Utopian is perfect place to discover so many new projects built with large variety of tools and languages. One does not need to wander around to find something new and interesting as it comes to us in Utopian. I mentioned it before, I would say that I am more of the observing type that is better to have access to as many information sources as possible. Sometimes, I feel like there’s too much to it but at the same time, leaving anything out of the view would make me feel that I deliberately ignored it. Knowing about the daily routines and what people talk about is part of our work in Utopian. I am hard to share anything from my “real life”. Although we are not able to avoid not to share personal information in today’s world, I would keep other interesting aspects and periods of the life to myself. It is not that it could not be shared but I would say that it is one of my bad characteristics. It may not look like it but it is difficult for me to do anything that I do not see as profitable to me, and I am not talking about money. Sharing more than necessary is therefore not of my interest here. Believe me or not, I am not really a likeable person and not many people are willing to stick around. But it is also them who slowly change my attitude and perception of the world. I don’t have pets as they would want to run away from me.  Nah, really I am bad at taking care of someone else. I have to take care of friend’s plants which for unknown reasons resist to grow. I like music like Damien Rice, Of Monsters and Men, Daughter, and Keaton Henson. I can’t name a genre to pick the music I like and I am ignorant enough to actually remember the lyrics but this kind of music is soothing to me. When I need to stop thinking, I play something from these interprets. I think that for many people it could be depressive, perhaps it is, but for me it is calm. There is something special about these. It is hard to grasp it and properly name it but they are unusual artists. As for the shows, I like anime movies. They look simple yet they are often thousand times better than any western animated movie. If I were to pick some, Howl’s Moving Castle or Your Name. (Kimi no na wa.) could be good examples. I don’t know why but I admire strong relationships between people and when a person is willing to give up something of theirs for someone else. That’s something that I am far from able to do, or at least I feel that way. What was the path that led you to Utopian.io? You could say that it was a coincidence that led me to the Steem blockchain. It was in August last year, when the Internet was full of YouTube demonetizing video content creators. I came across an interview with @heimindanger talking about DTube, at that time not yet an open source project. Checking the site required an account but unlike on other websites, this one required an account on Steemit. I was really curious what that was about, as they claimed that the authors can earn some money for the content. Not long after I joined, I was given an opportunity to work for the Busy.org team. They were working on the private beta. One of @fabien’s friends was asking for help with some Czech string translations, and I sent him what I thought was best. My response to this simple request opened the doors for me to Busy.org and I knew from the beginning that I liked it more than Steemit, even though they had only few features compared to Steemit at the time. Still, it looked better and was more user friendly. That moment could be the second coincidental event that pulled me into the open source world. The third coincidence, as I see it, was the moment elear literally took the code of unpublished Busy version 2, and made a new project out of it. The early times of Utopian. At first, I thought that it was bad of him, since he published a project that revealed the work done on another project and kept somewhat secret from users. But after I talked to fabien about that, I understood that it was really alright, and it was the principle of open source code that allowed @elear to use the code published to create something new. What made you want to get involved? Although I was familiar with some open source tools, I did not really make my own before, nor was I involved in any open source project. I would say that almost all my experience with open source projects come from the Steem ecosystem and projects that are built on top of it. So before Utopian, my involvement in open source was more that of user, and genuine contributor of translations and bug reports for Busy. This pushed me towards Utopian. You were, up until recently, the CM of the blog category. How did you find yourself in that position? Since I’ve gotten involved with Utopian.io, I have been assigned different roles within the moderation team, the latest of which was the role of the Community Manager of the Blog Posts category. Long before that I was one of the first moderators to help keep Utopian in shape. It was not an easy task because the ideas and view of Utopian progress were different. To be honest, I had few moments when I considered leaving. One of the reasons was the degree to which the moderator position was time-consuming and I was not able to efficiently manage it. But you decided to stay, fortunately for us all. What changed your mind? I would say that my involvement in Utopian was highly affected by our team, the people who I could work with everyday, their engagement and ideas on how to make Utopian better. To me, Utopian is full of inspiring people, and it is them who have impact on me and my day-to-day decisions. We would not be able to get so far without some of them. Moreover, I can’t forget elear. He is the man who could convince me to endure the tough times and he is the man who came with the brilliant idea of Utopian. I believe that it has been him and his passion for the project over those months that made me want to be a part of Utopian. I did not see a project like that before and I am happy to help this project move forward. It’s become a kind of addiction for me. Still, I am really glad I had not left. Not only did you stick around, but you continued to climb up the corporate ladder before it was even there. How did that happen? After working hard as a moderator, I was asked to oversee the team as the first supervisor. Back then, everybody basically worked on all kinds of contributions. The role was very similar to that of a Community Manager, but involved managing a smaller group of people. It was only later, when we needed to recruit more people, that we created “specialized” groups of moderators. A few months later, the role of Community Managers replaced that of Supervisors, as we slowly changed our approaches, and strived to engage the community more throughout the contribution evaluation process. Since we had so many amazing people in the team who fit their positions, I somehow assumed the blog category would be some kind of leftover. Not in a bad way, of course, but because moderating blog posts does not sound as exciting as working with developers and watching their progress with projects. Luckily for me, I was wrong. I have worked with so many great people, some whom remain in the category moderation team still. Now you have a new role in the organization. One that was obviously needed. What can you tell us about it? Utopian has grown into a serious and large project that is backed legally by a registered company. Although everyone in the team has their own role in the whole system, it was not enough. Utopian consists of tens of people who work on different tasks and many of them live far far away and the communication is not always easy. There were so many occasions where a simple task could be left undone simply because the focal point for most activities in the company was only one man - @elear. He was involved in literally everything Utopian, but as we all know, one can’t do everything on their own. So to help remedy this situation, I was offered to step down as a Community Manager and to accept a new position: Operational Manager. In short, my job is ensure everyone in team (moderators, CMs, developers) to do their work it a timely and coordinated fashion. Sadly, we are still behind on the delivery plan. But as I said, it is now my duty to make sure that the tasks are completed and nothing is blocked. The results may not come immediately but I believe that they will be visible soon. I am not a person who can provide years of experience in such a position but I believe that I will be able to do it as best as I can, and that we will get all things organized and done. How do you see the future of Utopian? What would you want it to be, and where would you like to see yourself in it? I would like to see Utopian as stable and globally recognized company and initiative, with its aim to support and fund open source projects. While our path to realizing that vision has changed quite significantly in the past half year, the idea remains. Utopian is a place for enthusiasts and professionals working on open source projects, and unlike other platforms, which do have similar roots, Utopian is not focused on developers only, but it is open to many of types of contributions and the list may grow in time. There are many areas in which Utopian could offer support by utilizing its rewarding system, and there is always room for better definition of the guidelines and processes for reward. Although, further generalization will require more people involved, both in the Utopian team and in the community. We are in the process of rebuilding the front end, which is an important part of Utopian, and serves to identify and differentiate it from other Steem apps. I believe that when we are able to present it, our users will want to contribute more, as they often told us that they are not satisfied with the current process of contribution submission through alternative blockchain frontends. From my point of view, I feel I have been more of a supporter and observer who alerted and warned team members if anything went wrong way. With this new position, I suddenly face new responsibilities that will help me decide if I am suitable and capable to lead people efficiently. That position is not that far from leading the organization, right?  Just kidding! The responsibilities I got are huge, and I am yet to see what the outcome will be. If there is another opportunity to go up, I would take it with gratitude. Utopian WitnessVote for our witness!

Weekly Open ConferenceTransparency, openness and collaboration are key drivers in the growth of Utopian.io. In the past, we’ve attempted to separate our bi-weekly updates to the community from our weekly team management talks. To try and get everyone at the same place at the same time to get updates and offer insight, we’ve decided to focus on our weekly Utopian.io team conferences, and invite you to join us weekly on Friday at 5PM CET (GMT+2). As always, we are open to your input, and these weekly conferences are your chance to communicate to the entire management team of Utopian.io at once. Translations are Expanding!The Translations category under the management of the DaVinci initiative is a stellar success. With a team of language managers, pre-authorized translators, and under the leadership of the DaVinci team and our own @rosatravels with @jmromero, it’s really no wonder that the category instantly returned to being one of the most active on Utopian.io. In light of this, Utopian.io and @davinci.witness will start accepting applications for translation teams for a number of additional languages. Be sure to check the blog post on the @davinci.witness blog for instructions on how to join the team. Utopian v2 Sneak PeeksOur development team has been hard at work creating Utopian v2 for you. With a rich feature-set and scalable backend, Utopian.io in its next form promises to be an innovative and revolutionary frontend to the Steem blockchain. Here are a few shots of the UI as we construct what we hope will be the base of the New Open Source Economy. Note that the project is still in development and the interface may change. Homepage The homepage layout has been updated to better fit with the content. Recent contributions and task requests You will find the most recent task requests right on the homepage. Of course, it will be easy to list other contributions and task requests. Connect your Github account with Utopian Submit your project to Utopian You will be able to have your own page for a project. It will be as easy as filling a short form with basic information about your project, including visual assets. Project page Your page could look like this one. All information at one place will ease the navigation throughout the project contributions and finding a task request for a project will be simple.

Welcoming SteemApp and Hede.io to the VIPO Club!Our exclusive list of Very Important Project Owners continues to grow, and this week we’ve added a few particularly inspiring projects. Credits: SteemApp team The first project team to join us this week was SteemApp - a mobile app for Steem on Android and iOS. This mobile app has been in development already, but with their interest in Utopian.io, the project owners decided to open their code to the community, and look for contributors who can join the beta testing of the product. You can read more about the project and find out how to contribute in their announcement post. Credits: Hede team In addition, we are proud to welcome to Utopian Hede.io, a project that aims to become a repository for dictionary and wiki-type content on the Steem blockchain, based upon personal experience on a particular topic. The project owner reached out to the Utopian team for consultation on their project announcement, and we are excited to be part of this ambitious initiative on Steem. Additional information can be found in their announcement post. We hope to see your contributions to these projects across all Utopian.io categories, helping them grow and flourish. Collaboration with @sndboxThe Steem-based initiative @sndbox is collecting donations for a Steem promotional activity at The Crypto Renaissance exhibition in New York. Among others, this exhibition will include a wall dedicated to Utopian.io, and their latest post included a draft of this display.

While development of Utopian v2.0 is still ongoing, we are optimizing and refining workflows, internal documents and processes as well as organizing community events, giveaways and more. In this update: New public guidelines for tips New policy for account suspension Utopian trail script upgrades Utopian meetup announcement First giveaways in Utopian.io Open Source Radio Show on MSP Waves Utopian.io Comment Tipping GuidelinesInsightful and detailed comments are an integral part of the success of any online community. At Utopian, we wish to encourage our community to invest time in detailed, insightful and helpful comments on contributions submitted to Utopian. The category Community Managers are tasked with the duty of finding and rewarding such comments through tips. In an aim to increase the number of comments tipped, we’ve created a guide explaining how you can increase your chances of earning a comment tip. This document includes, in addition to tips, a number of examples of previously tipped comments. For now, this document is available in a GitHub repository, but will be included in the documentation on the future frontend of Utopian v2.0. Account Suspension PolicyWhen policies are violated and users are harmful for the community, their accounts can and should be suspended. To ensure everyone is treated equally in cases where an account suspension is necessary, we’ve worked out a set of policies to serve you and the Utopian team in understanding and managing the process. Unfortunately, Utopian has faced numerous cases of contributors not respecting moderators’ decisions, and using illegitimate ways to bypass account suspension. This issue is one of those addressed. It is important to note that we have always taken the issue of abuse attempts very seriously. Though it is our hope that situations where these guidelines will be used are very few, it is still important for us to have these policies in place. The document can be found in a dedicated GitHub repository. Second Round of Applications to the Translations CategoryWatching the Translations category flourish under the management of the DaVinci team is simply astonishing. This week, from July 1st to July 5th, the second round of applications for translators and new language moderators was run. Promising candidates were discovered for Polish, Slovenian, Dutch and Arabic, as well as new translators for the existing groups were found, so the translation team will soon grow to cover even more of the languages spoken worldwide, and moderators to join enhancing selected projects with their work. You can expect an announcement from the DaVinci team very soon on their blog at @davinci.witness. Utopian Meetup AnnouncementThe most exciting news this week is our planned “company retreat” (meetup, mini-hackathon or however you with to call it). Obviously, the Utopian core team want to meet the Utopian moderators, collaborators and community members so we’re not only inviting you, but also hoping to crowdfund the expenses for participating team members. The Utopian meetup will take place in Italy in late September, following the SteemSTEM meetup in Florence. This is the first opportunity for everyone to meet most of the Utopian team at one place and we hope to meet you all in Italy! You can find all information in the Utopian meetup announcement. Utopian.io Open Source Radio Show Giveaways As our listener crowd continues to grow, we are happy to announce that the first Utopian sponsored raffle took place during the show this week. Two exciting prizes were awarded to two lucky winners who proposed some… colorful ideas to participate. The first raffle prize, a Udemy course of his choice, was awarded to our own @knowledges who can now pick how to expand his, well, knowledges. We believe that a new skill is the best gift to give, so we hope to include similar educational giveaways in future raffles too. The second raffle prize for the show was a Humble Bundle Cybersecurity Software collection and was awarded by our raffle bot to @lemouth who politely declined his prize. This prize will be raffled out again on the show next week, along with other gifts and surprises we’re preparing have for you. Got ideas for cool giveaways you’d like to see raffled out? Let us know! And don’t forget to tune in for your weekly fix of Open Source content, interviews, news and of course - awesome giveaways on the Utopian.io Open Source Radio Show on MSP Waves on Wednesdays at 6 PM UTC. Utopian Innovation Trail OptimizationDue to unreliable responses from the Steem nodes, we’ve had some issues with our Innovation Trail. Some of the posts that we believed were upvoted missed their votes due to timeouts from the nodes. Our developer team resolved the issue, and the Utopian trail is up and running again. If you spot any malfunction or issues with the Innovation Trail initiative of Utopian, please get in touch with our team on our Discord channel.

Meet the pink lady that seems to be everywhere. On Github: https://github.com/techslut Who are you, @techslut? I am a content writer in Israel with pink hair and too many years of experience as a technology journalist, marketer, advertiser and copywriter. When I am not plotting the future of open source economy with Utopian.io as a world-known brand, I watch science fiction shows, read technology related news, and spend time with my significant others. Yes, others. There is more than one. I live an open source kind of life. In the past I practiced martial arts including Muai Thai and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, cooked delicious dishes and liked long walks. This all took a back seat when I became ill with fibromyalgia, an unpleasant chronic pain condition that forces me to work from home (rather than an office) and causes me to be sleepy and grumpy half the time. People say the other half is worth tolerating the sleepy and grumpy me. Writing is my life. I’ve always written and will continue to write as long as I can put letters on paper / screen. I’ve worked as a technology journalist, blogged from the age of dial-up internet, and even had a few poems of mine published locally. Being as pink and as active I am on social media, I am considered a very minor local Facebook celebrity in some circles. Drawing by @jillustrations What brought you to the Steem blockchain, and how did that path lead to Utopian.io? In late 2016 I visited a friend of mine in Israel (@simba) who very excitedly told me of a blogging platform where he made money just posting photographs. I was intrigued. I joined, made a few posts and some STEEM, but life got in the way and I abandoned my steemit blog, promising myself I would return to monetize the writing process of my novel. When cryptocurrency became “hot” again in 2017, I returned to Steemit, as I said I would, and began to publish my novel with the help of the kind editors on @theisleofwrite. Payouts were nice, and I was getting involved with initiatives (and getting in trouble with some bernies) when I saw a post by @elear about an inspiring new initiative on the blockchain aimed at rewarding voluntary contributions to open source projects. My reaction? I delegated half of my then SP to @utopian-io. Pretty soon, Utopian.io didn’t quite need my little delegation as it became one of the most successful initiatives to pop up on Steem with a truly revolutionary vision. So I looked for other ways to help and found myself bugging @elear daily and calling myself his human Siri in an attempt to try and get involved. It eventually worked. What is your role in Utopian.io and what do you actually do? I wear two hats in Utopian - that of the Visibility category manager and that of the chief marketer. While I postpone my investment in my category until Utopian can once again offer a more “marketer friendly” interface, I focus on community activities, PR and marketing efforts to make Utopian.io a familiar name on the lips of the global open source community. Among others, I write, edit or proof the majority of the content published on Utopian.io Steemit blogs (@utopian.edu and @utopian-io), report the news (and make things funny) on the Utopian.io Open Source Radio Show on MSP Waves, and chat to many project owners looking for advice and consultation on how to best draw contributors and users to their projects. Drawing by @beekart What other steem communities / initiatives are you part of? I tend to make connections wherever I go, so I have friends at @buildteam, I founded the Israeli Steemit community, contributed some to various initiatives here and there, and I try to help out wherever I can whenever I have the time. I believe this blockchain is home to many amazing people and communities, and it has the potential to host many more. Whatever I can do to promote that - I do. Being a marketer and author, how do you feel you contribute to Utopian.io and open source? Open source needs more marketers. If you look around the FOSS ecosystem, it is full of developers and technologists, while marketers and content creators shy away from this often elitist group. I do not shy away. It’s not my style. And the ecosystem needs me. In a blog series I started writing (and promise to continue), I discussed the importance of content and marketing for open source projects. In short: you can’t get collaborators or users for your project if you don’t go out and tell people it exists. My years of experience marketing mobile apps and promoting content for major brands and companies in the technological industries have given me a unique insight into the relationship between technology, people and money. I hope this knowledge and experience can be of use to Utopian.io and to projects on Utopian.io as well. How do you see the future of Utopian? What would you want it to be, and where would you like to see yourself in it? From the very first moment, I knew Utopian.io had the potential to be a stellar success. It’s why I quit my other jobs and decided to focus on it 100%. The future I see is bright. I believe Utopian.io will continue to grow at an exponential rate now that the teams and workflows are better organized that before. I am really looking forward to seeing the new frontend in action and reading the feedback from the users of the beta. I hope to continue in my role as CMO in Utopian.io for a long time. I hope to someday onboard grandchildren to the platform, if I have any. I also hope to see my team of content creators and public relations managers grow, and perhaps include something resembling a “sales” team in the future as well. Photo by @ingaaa What is your favorite thing about Utopian? Undoubtedly the people. May of this year was a trying month for Utopian.io as an organization. We lost everything but the people, really. What we had at the end of the day were the faith of our investors, the skills of our team and the sheer persistence of our mutual vision. We persevered and didn’t miss a beat, coming out even stronger and wiser from the disaster that struck at our Utopia. I believe that it is those “make or break” moments that define an organization and can indicate its potential for success. Utopian.io passed that test with flying colors thanks to the amazing people on the team. Utopian WitnessVote for our witness!

Welcoming New Very Important Project Owners (VIPOs)Our exclusive club of FOSS projects, enabling the access to free professional services and a unique support system to Open Source projects of all sizes, continues to attract additional projects and initiative looking to empower their project through Utopian.io. This week, we’d like to highlight two newcomers to the club: Byteball and Steemer. Byteball Byteball is an open source block-free cryptocurrency platform. They’ve been focused on the development of the whole project, and feel now is the time to expose to the masses. We welcome their choice of the Steem ecosystem as they’ve worked hard to bridge between the Steem blockchain and the Byteball platform. Not only is the platform successful in achieving the goals set by the developers, but it is also a clear example of how two large platforms can complement one another and collaborate to achieve mutual goals. You can read more about Byteball, and the team’s plan to attract Steem users to Byteball in their recent post and also in an official Steemit blog post welcoming the Byteball team to Steem. It is our great pleasure and honor to welcome Byteball to the VIPO club, giving our community of contributors a clear and direct path to making contributions to improve the platform even further. As the team aims for platform mass-adoption, translators are of need on this project. Of course, one cannot forget the building pillars of a project: the development team and software testers. If you are interested in contributing to this amazing project, contact @punqtured and he will give you all necessary information for you to join the forces and start working on tasks. Official tasks requests will be published in the following weeks and resteemed on @utopian.tasks to give you the maximum information necessary to contribute to the project. Joining the Steem blockchain, the Byteball team prepared a pleasant surprise for all users - they announced a free airdrop for all Steemians! Linking your Steem account with a Byteball wallet will give you an advantage in sending funds to your Steem comrades as you will not have to send funds to long and hard-to-remember addresses. You can earn your first Bytes depending on your current reputation. The attestation rewards are as follows: | Reputation | Reward | |-|-| |30+|$10| |40+|$20| |50+|$40| |60+|$80| |70+|$160| If you would like to have more information and join the airdrop you can visit this link. Steemer Steemer is a mobile app for interacting with the Steem blockchain. The developer, @hispeedimagins, has been working on the app for some time and he would like to increase the number of app users. In other words, he welcomes advertisers who would help with spreading the word about this app on the blockchain and beyond. Furthermore, the app has been released in the Google Play last week, so give it a try and share your new ideas, features that you would like to see in this app, and if you come across some bugs - do report them! You can read more in the latest announcement post and watch the development post series. Translations Category GrowthThe DaVinci team is working hard on the Translations category and their latest announcement details their team growth, introducing new members and better team structure as the project continues to expand. For more information on their current structure, you can check this post. Utopian.io on The Crypto Renaissance Exhibition Website The Crypto Renaissance exhibition will be held next week in New York and the team from @sndbox are hard at work publishing the updates regarding the event. One of the latest additions to this whole event is a newly created web page dedicated to the event and all selected projects on Steem blockchain.

Meet @deathwing, one of the oldest and most involved members of the Utopian.io team. On Github: https://github.com/xDeathwing Who are you, @deathwing? I am one of those people who prefer to remain anonymous on the Internet so you all just know me as Deathwing. I live in Turkey and my main interest is language. I love languages and I am currently studying English/American Literature and Culture. Being an acid games and huge fan of Strategy games, I probably played all familiar Strategy games up to this date (with some notable ones being Command and Conquer, Warcraft and Starcraft series, also the classic; Age of Empires) and some Action/MOBA from time to time. I wanted to be professional gamer for a long time but I discovered that interacting with people while playing was more fun than actually playing the games. So I found myself moving from “playing the game” to “engaging in it”. I have a small, cute but very angry cockatiel named Lemon. He’s not a great model, but he tries. Something everyone on the Utopian.io team knows about me is that I love eating! I just love food! I love cooking too but not nearly as much as eating - eating is always better than cooking because, well, less work involved and I am a huge meat lover. So if you know some different Utopian-grade (see what I did there?) tastes, do let me know! What led you to Utopian.io? I joined Steem in its early stages and I wasn’t keen on using it at first. What I found interesting about the Steem blockchain was that it was both a scary and magnificent system, that let people earn money by just writing in little blogs. After searching for ways to take part I found that the niche of “normal” blogs was full of people who had thousands of STEEM and SP. As a user with 15 delegated SP, it was intimidating so I left the site for a while. A few months later, in October or November, I decided to check the site again. On the trending feed, I saw a Utopian.io post. Curious, I clicked and read it. One thing led to another, and here we are. I started out as a translator on Utopian.io. When the SBD price started to spike to about $13, the number of translation contributions probably quadrupled (if not even more than that). While I was working really hard to ensure that everything was translated properly, people were using machine translation tools like Google Translate and were trying to reap the rewards of machine work. I found this upsetting and realized the cause was a short-handed staff and a shortage in Turkish moderators along with an influx of Turkish and Indonesian translations. I wrote to @omersurer and asked if I could help, having worked as a translator before and having fluent English. He directed me to Ruah who was quick to recruit me as a moderator. Before long, I found myself a team Supervisor, and then Community Manager of the Tutorials category in January 2018. After six months in that role, I stepped down from Community Manager position and switched to a core team role of Public Relations Manager. Now I work with my boss(es) @espoem and @techslut to ensure the community is active and engaged with Utopian.io content and activities. Your current role in the organization is Public Relations Manager. What does it entail, and why do you think you’re the man for the job? While I don’t tend to reveal too much personal information, I consider myself a really social person and I love talking with others. I wanted to use these skills to help Utopian.io directly, and without being limited to the Tutorials category. In addition, I felt I could do more than just oversee a category, especially since we had two community managers for it, and not enough work to justify paying us both. As Public Relations Manager I ensure our AI Utopy works as it should, help organize contests and raffles on the Utopian.io Open Source Radio Show, manage partner relationships and a lot more work will be coming as the platform grows and we will have an active front-end. In addition, my help is sometimes needed in preparing blog posts for the various Utopian.io publications, so I assist @techslut in writing, proofreading and preparing the content for publishing as part of the content team. What would you say is your favorite thing about Utopian.io? How inclusive it is. Everyone can participate, whether they know coding or not and everyone has a skill to offer. People can apply skills like translation, copywriting, visual arts and teaching through tutorials, and be rewarded for their efforts. I love how everything works. Everyone on the team knows what to do for their specific categories and how to manage it through the good and bad times. To me Utopian.io is like an online family. Even though most of us haven’t met in real life (yet), Utopian.io is a place I could probably call a family still. When we’re not working, we always chat with each other for fun, whether it’s about food, candy, and how to bother our CEO @elear in many different ways. ;) Even though we hit some roadblocks in the past, hurting our brand reputation, we always look forward to thrive. How do you see the future of Utopian.io and where would you like to see yourself in it? I believe that through hard work by Utopian.io users and the team, we will be a stable, always-improving, super active place for GitHub projects and their contributors. I am actually happy where I am right now. I like my work and I like people who are working with me. This is literally a dream job come true and I hope to see our company in Forbes Magazine in the near future. To achieve this goal we all have to work together. Ad victoriam ad infinitum.

Fill out the pre-registration form for the beta, and you might just get the chance to be the first to test drive the new Utopian.io and help us make it perfect for public launch. We will be collecting the candidate applications for the beta over this upcoming week, and by next Friday the beta-testers chosen will be notified. Welcoming Actifit to the Utopian.io VIPO Have you ever wanted to be rewarded for physical activity? With Actifit, you can! We are delighted to welcome another innovative Steem application to the Utopian.io VIPO Club - Actifit. Developed by none other than our own Utopian.io team member @mcfarhat, the project aims to help users get in shape and make a few tokens while doing it. By creating their own token ACTIFIT (currently as ERC20 tokens which will be swapped with SMTs once they are implemented and released on the Steem blockchain), this brilliant app rewards users for reported activities. Using Actifit is easy. All you need to do is install the Android app and you can start tracking your sport activity (and getting rewarded). Tokens can be obtained by submitting the reports with the Actifit app to the Steem blockchain. Furthermore, tokens are distributed to delegators as well, so everyone wins when you sweat. Everything you need to know to join this new initiative can be found in their recent announcement. Time to get moving! Utopian votesWith the integration of the Utopian.io Innovation Trail to support innovative curation initiatives on the blockchain, we found ourselves juggling voting power to ensure contributors are rewarded in a fair and timely fashion without pausing the trail voting activity. To better make use of our voting power and ensure it is fairly distributed, we’ve made some minor changes to the behavior of our voting bot. Vote orderSo far, @utopian-io voted on reviewed contributions in an order according to the score received in the moderator’s review. While we continue to strive to reward the very best, the community has to offer the open source ecosystem, we’ve decided to change the sorting criteria to include the date of creation of the post, rather than the date of review. We hope this will result in more contribution being rewarded sooner, giving them additional visibility and attracting more votes from the community. Curation trail supportTo ensure our voting power is kept first and foremost for you, the contributors, we’ve adjusted the Utopian.io Innovation Trail script to trigger only when the voting power of @utopian-io is equal or higher than 99%. If it is lower, the trail will be suspended for 2 hours to recover the VP, then resume voting. To keep most of the votes to follow, the bot keeps track of curation trail votes for 2 days. QuestionnaireThe questionnaire used by moderation to evaluate the contributions on daily basis is one of the most important tools our team uses daily. As we constantly work to improve and optimize it to reflect the value of the work done by the contributor, we’ve updated the questionnaire and score values for some of our categories. This week, we looked at the translations and graphics categories, in both cases focusing mostly on the point system. We hope to complete this round of updates with the other categories over the next few days. As always, we appreciate your feedback, and would like to hear from you which aspects of our review system we should focus to make it better and clearer for everyone to make use of. Fundition campaign The planned meetup with Utopian.io and SteemSTEM in Italy still needs your support to cover expenses. The recent updates cover the number of confirmed attendees in the VIRGO labs, as well as the overview of the countries the members come from and the age distribution. An additional update including some information on the places we plan to visit was published as well, and more are to follow to tell you all about the observatory and gravitational waves. You can catch up on all the news in this latest post published by @steemstem. Task Request BountiesTo better cater to the needs of project owners and preferences of contributors, Utopian.io has come with a different concept of rewarding the completion of task requests. Up until now, all the task requests held only little of the rewards for the task solvers and the majority of the rewards were distributed as the contributors submitted their work in Utopian. Utopian is experimenting with concentrating the rewards at the task assignment and when a solver comes up with the desired solution for the task, the rewards will be sent to them in the form of a liquid STEEM bounty. One of the recent examples of this new approach is a task request on documenting and describing steps needed to run private Steem network. This task request by the Blockchain Competence Centre of the European commission is also unique for other reasons. It was published using the Utopian account for the project, and it is one of the first steps in building a new project through tasks rather than enhancing an existing one. Don’t miss the opportunity to be a part of this unique project, and check the task request at @utopian.tasks where the assignment was published in full.

With his vast experience, humble nature and expertise in Python, it’s hard to believe how young he is. On Github: https://github.com/amosbastian Who are you, @amosbastian? I’m a 24 year old computer science student, half English (born there) and half Dutch (lived there the majority of my life), currently living in Lisbon. I’m really interested in programming (which is quite obvious), football (Glory Glory Man United!), gaming (1v1 me) and, if I can be bothered, lifting weights. I don’t think I have any special talents; I can’t play any musical instruments and it’s a wonder I can speak more than one language (English and Dutch). I guess I do have a lot of knowledge about beer, if that counts for anything. One may say I’m a pretty open guy who enjoys meeting new people, talking to them and joking around. I’ve had people tell me that I am one of the most laid back people they have ever met (maybe it’s just my laziness), which I tend to sort of agree with since it’s pretty hard to phase me. However, since I’m half Dutch (maybe it’s just an excuse), I’m quite straight-forward or “blunt”. I dislike people who beat around the bush without getting to a point. Also, despite my laid-back nature, if I disagree with something I will make sure to let you know, and can get quite passionate when that’s the case (sorry!). Walking to the remotest pub in the UK How long have you been involved in Open Source projects? I actually wasn’t really involved in open source projects before joining Utopian. I was mainly busy with stuff on Reddit, though I have created some things for the post-match thread team on /r/leagueoflegends, and a bot for /r/fantasypl. They were all kept closed source - the main reason being my embarrassment at my admittedly shitty code. Looking back at it now I wish I was a bit more confident and had gotten involved in open source projects years ago. It’s a great way to improve your programming skills while meeting cool people, so I would definitely urge people who feel the same as I did to just say “fuck it” and take that leap. Do you own / manage one or more projects of your own? Currently I have a few projects that I have been maintaining, as you can see on my GitHub profile, and have a few plans for projects I want to further improve or create over the next few months. I’m really excited about them, but will keep them under wraps for now. What does your professional skill-set offer the Open Source community and what type of contributions do you normally make? I actually started on Utopian.io by contributing mostly tutorials (collaborating with a friend on the account @steempytutorials). At the time, I was learning how to use steem-python, so I thought it would be a great way to help people solve the problems I was encountering myself. I feel I was burnt out writing tutorials and also came to the conclusion that I really wanted to focus on myself more and get additional experience actually developing stuff. So nowadays I mostly submit contributions to the development category, but sometimes I also report bugs to the bug hunting category. Which programming languages / platforms do you feel most at home with? As you may have guessed, I am most comfortable programming with Python - I use it daily and it has pretty much become my bread and butter. I’m still far from satisfied with my skill level, so I will soon be buying a physical copy (I hate reading PDFs off a screen) of Fluent Python, as I’ve heard great things about it. I have also been busy with learning some more JavaScript and a bit of Vue.js, as I really want to be able to help out Utopian internally (and also some of my aforementioned planned projects require this as well). How did you discover Utopian, and how do you think Utopian affects your relationships with the Open Source community and ecosystem? I’ve always been interested in helping others by either showing them how to do or create something. When I saw that you could get rewarded for doing exactly that by contributing to Utopian I thought that was really cool. So I joined. I am, without a doubt, more involved in the open source community than I was before I found Utopian, which makes me feel really grateful. It has really incentivised my thirst for learning new things. Previously, I used to spend a lot of my time playing League of Legends, but now I mostly spend it on actively learning about new things (by either reading, programming, discussing etc.), so I definitely don’t feel like I’m wasting my time as much as I was before. Obviously this also feels very rewarding, especially when it makes me feel like my personal growth isn’t stagnating and that my time is spent on more valuable things. So yeah, I would definitely say it has affected my relationship with the open source community in a very positive way: I’m more involved, learning a lot, which in turn means I can contribute more value - it’s amazing! Utopian.io also changed the way I see the impact of the open source movement. As I mentioned earlier, I didn’t want to share my code when people asked, mostly because I was embarrassed at its quality. I also didn’t really understand why they wanted me to share it. Now my mindset is completely different and I feel like I really do understand why code should be shared. This makes me feel very passionate about open source in general, but also regretful I didn’t come to this conclusion sooner. Well, let’s just say I’m more than happy I found Utopian.io and made it part of my life. Watching Manchester United play for the first time What made you decide to take on additional roles in the organization itself? When I first started contributing I just had this overwhelming sense of excitement and inspiration. After everything sank in and I realised how great Utopian’s vision actually, was I applied to be a moderator pretty much straight away, as I knew I needed to be a part of it. I was initially rejected by @mkt because his team was full (), so after two weeks of bugging @jestemkioskiem I finally got my foot in the door and was allowed in as a tutorial moderator. I actually still vividly remember my first day moderating as back then contributions could be any language and a large part of tutorials were really below par. I spent most of my time busting plagiarists and rejecting low quality contributions. This became some kind of routine for me (also tag teaming contributions with @roj) and I guess I sort of built up a reputation as a “strict” moderator, as I took quality over quantity quite seriously. During a weekly management meeting @elear mentioned that there might be a need for a new supervisor (as they were then called). Out of nowhere, @espoem suggested it should be me, which came as a very pleasant surprise. I was asked if I would be interested, and of course I answered yes - to me it seemed like a great opportunity to get myself in a position where I could have some more influence within Utopian and try to help guide it in the “right” direction, in my own way. A few weeks passed and it wasn’t really mentioned again until @mkt announced he was stepping down. After having a voice call with him (where we mostly talked about recreational activities :^)) I found myself in the position of development supervisor/community manager - a position I have latched onto ever since. How do you see the future of Utopian? What would you want it to be, and where would you like to see yourself in it? I really think the future of Utopian.io is bright, especially when I consider all the amazing people that are already involved in the organization. It would be really great if it could break through to a broader audience, though, as I’d love to see every open source contributor receiving some kind of support from us. There’s definitely a long road ahead, but I’m sure we can do it. I’m bad at expressing my feelings properly (unless beer is involved) so bear with me - I’m trying my best to get across how excited I am about its potential! Where I see myself in the future… at THE TOP after having ousted @elear! Just joking! As I mentioned earlier I want to work hard on improving my programming skills so I can help more on that front, but other than that I have no idea - I’ll just go with the flow and see where this crazy ride takes me! What is your favorite thing about Utopian? This is a really difficult question as there are so many different things. I would say that it’s really amazing that people can get rewarded for contributing to open source projects, which has some kind of benefit to at least someone - I think that’s a great goal. Also, all the cool people involved! There are all kinds of people from different countries that all bring something unique, be it their personalities, skills or knowledge. I just love meeting new people and we definitely already have a great bunch. Huge shout-out to the development moderators in particular - you guys are the best! Was it Steem first and Utopian second for you, or did you discover Utopian before steem? Actually, the person (@juliank) who I collaborated with on @steempytutorials is also the person who brought me onto the Steem blockchain. We know each other from university and one day, out of nowhere, he asked me if I wanted to help him out with a project he had planned. During the call where he was explaining what the Steem blockchain actually is, he showed me some projects he thought were cool - including Utopian.io, of course. I guess I “discovered” both sort of simultaneously, and so I started contributing to Utopian pretty soon after actually joining Steemit. Are there any particular projects on Utopian you’re a fan of? There are quite a few projects that I’m a fan of, actually. They are also made by some of my favourite developers on Utopian: @miniature-tiger’s Archipelago game has been improving with each contribution, and he’s really a great example of someone who always submits quality contributions! @sambillingham is also great. He is constantly churning out amazing projects, but if you only have time to check out one I would definitely recommend checking out his Finally Comments project! Our very own @emrebeyler always has cool projects as well, and is definitely a source of inspiration for me! @mkt’s The Magic Frog (@the-magic-frog) is such a great idea and really a lot of fun - go participate if you haven’t already! There are so many more great projects on Utopian, so I can’t mention all of them (sorry!). I really look forward to seeing what kind of projects the future holds for us all. Steem is the home for many apps aside from Utopian. Which are your favorite and why? Admittedly I don’t really keep up with the Steem world outside of Utopian as much as I should, so I don’t actually know. Steem Monsters seems like a pretty cool idea, but other than that I can’t think of any. What other Steem communities / initiatives are you part of? Any you would like to create? I wouldn’t say I’m really involved with other communities, but I’m mostly (outside of programming) interested in football, so I always participate in predictions and similar things to that. Especially fantasy football is something I’m very interested in! Actually, the first thing I did when I joined Steem was looking for something related to the Fantasy Premier League and found out that @acidyo was hosting a league - I even wrote some articles about it back then with hints and tips, which I might start doing again in the future… maybe.

Total payout: 123.66 STU Number of votes: 46 FreeCAD - Greek Translation (Part 4 - approximately 1240 words) by @lordneroo [translations]Image source FreeCAD is a customizable parametric 3D CAD modeler aimed at real life product design and mechanical engineering. Due to its accessibility to Python programming, it offers a wider range of use cases on the architecture and general engineering fields. When talking about CAD modelers it’s inevitable to think in expensive proprietary software as the AutoDesk suite. However, there are viable and ever evolving open source alternatives, which are by far lead by FreeCAD. A cornerstone of open source usage is the capacity to spread it widely across potential users in a way that can satisfy their needs completely. Therefore constant and highly accurate internationalization efforts such as @lordneroo’s are invaluable for the FOSS community. His translation was done with strict accuracy standards based on engineering-oriented vocabulary.

In order for your contributions to be reviewed by our moderators, you only need to use two relevant tags using any frontend, such as busy.org or steemit.com. Until now, you had to use them as your very first two tags. Now you can use them in any position you want. While this may seem like a small change, it brings great benefits. Major dapps, such as @esteemapp or @dtube and others can now keep using their main tag, while still allowing access to the Utopian incentives. Curation guilds and other projects may decide to integrate the Utopian tags to enable additional rewards for their users, as we recently did with Fundition.io. How to use Utopian tagsBy using the correct Utopian tags, your post will be found and scored by our moderators as per our community guidelines. Utopian has a set of categories where you can publish your work and each category has a specific tag.

We’ve had some amazing announcements and made some important changes. In addition to all the good news in this post, this week we also say goodbye to a friend. In this post: All You Need to Know About the Utopian.io Mini-Hackathon Getting a Higher Upvote on Your Contribution Moderator Comment Rewards Contributors Wanted - Build Utopian.io v2 with Us! Utopian.io Open Source Radio Show on MSP Waves Utopian.io Mini-Hackathon Announcement &amp; ALL the DetailsAs promised in last week’s update, here it is: Everything you need to know about the awesome upcoming Utopian Hackathon (in collaboration with @steemstem). You can find all of the details in @Steemstem’s announcement post, but we’re going to tempt you to click with this bit of information. The prizes will be: First Place: 100% upvote + 300 STEEM Second Place: 80% + 150 STEEM Third Place: Upvote based on moderation score + 50 STEEM Get a Higher Upvote from @utopian-io with @steem-plus and SteeditorThis week, we announced an exciting partnership with Steemplus, a well-known browser extention that adds many useful features to users’ Steemit and busy.org experience. This announcement included a way to get bigger Utopian upvotes for your contributions. All you have to do is post using SteemPlus, then select Utopian as a 5% beneficiary and Steemplus as a 1% beneficiary. That 6 percent will be covered in the upvote, plus you’ll get an additional 10% increase in the upvote value corresponding to your contribution score. Here’s the formula. For example, if you were originally to get a 20% vote from Utopian, you would get instead: 20 + 20 * 10 / 100 + 6 = 28% vote But that’s not all! You can also get the same upvote increase by using one of the built-in Utopian templates in the awesome Steeditor by @jakipatryk. The beneficiary assignment is built in! A Change In Moderator RewardsIf you’ve contributed to Utopian in the past week, you may have noticed that the moderation comment on your submission received its own comment from Utopian, and an upvote. In an effort to have greater transparency, and to counteract the decreased value of the currency, we are now rewarding moderators for their work directly in the comment of each submission reviewed, and we’ve doubled their rewards. To balance that out, we’ve eliminated the bonus awarded for moderating more submissions. Build Utopian.io v2 with us!As you probably know, our development team has been hard at work in creating the base for the next Utopian.io, with features and functionalities requested by the community. Now, we welcome you to take part. Submit your development contributions to the GitHub and Firebase repositories! If you are not a developer - you can still help! We are still accepting applications for the Utopian v2 closed beta, and will gradually onboard more applicants. Visit beta.utopian.io/ to read more and sign up. Utopian.io Open Source Radio Show on MSP WavesWe had a great show this week. CryptoTYM from Team StoneCoin visited us to talk about the rebirth of the StoneCoin cryptocurrency, and @raycoms, one of the project leads of Minecolonies was live on the air, talking about current developments and new features, as well as the challenges in recruiting and maintaining an active and dedicated development team. We also raffled off codes for two courses on Udemy, and caught up with some interesting news from the Open Source world in the automotive and entertainment industries.

The delegation is due to return in a week and the reason for this temporary withdrawal is moving of stakes by Steemit Inc. To ensure Utopian.io continues to review and score your contributions, we’re making some changes to the distribution of voting power by @utopian-io to reduce VP consumption until the delegation is returned. Contribution IncentivesThe process of reviewing submissions to Utopian.io and scoring them for potential review will remain unchanged, and the same voting power percentage will be used to upvote the reviewed submissions according to their score. Though the upvote value of this percentage is significantly lower as a result of our temporarily reduced delegation, contributions are, as always, very welcome. Moderator &amp; Community Manager RewardsTo conserve voting power, moderation rewards will be reduced by 50% as of 00:00 UTC today. In addition, community managers will not be awarded the regular fixed reward, but can still receive incentives for actively reviewing and scoring contribution to their respective categories. Utopian.io Innovation TrailFor the time being, we are reducing our support of the communities in the Utopian.io Innovation Trail by lowering the voting power reserved for the trail by 50%. TippingThe tipping system will be temporary disabled until the delegation is returned. We are sorry for the inconvenience caused, and wish to resume normal operation within the coming week. We are working closely with Steemit Inc. to make sure the process is smooth and will be sure to update you as it progresses. Thank you for your patience and ongoing support! We would also like to take this chance to thank our team for the quick response and patience, and to our friends in other companies on the blockchain who were quick to offer their support while we work to return to normal operations.

Whether you are a developer, content creator or just a creative mind, Utopian.io is here to help you succeed and improve as is evident by the many Steem apps and contributors succeeding on this blockchain through collaboration and contributor incentives through Utopian.io. With the vision of bringing millions of bright minds together, Utopian continues to incentivise and expand collaborations. Today, we bring you a world of new opportunities and contribution incentives, powered by @steem-ua, @steem-plus, steeditor.app and others. @steem-ua - A New Reputation Standard@steem-ua, run by seasoned Utopian.io contributors @scipio and @holger80, aims to provide an alternative to the current reputation system on the Steem blockchain (which is known to have flaws). With their hard work, these two geniuses quickly brought to life the early version of @steem-ua. We, in Utopian are proud to be among the first testers of such innovative project and gain access to the UA-API as one of the first UA Registered Partners. As of today, @steem-ua will upvote scored contributions in Utopian using the @steem-ua algorithms and dynamics. You can read more about it here: https://steemit.com/@steem-ua. Essentially, submitting quality open source contributions to Utopian now will guarantee access to @steem-ua incentives without requiring registration to the Steem-UA services via delegation. To help grow both @steem-ua and incentivize contributors to excel, Utopian.io is delegating 18,000 SP to support @steem-ua, bringing the total stake delegated to the account to over 136,000 SP at the time of writing. We are excited and grateful to be part of this important project, and once again thank @scipio and @holger80 for launching this initiative. Increase in Max Category Upvote CapsWith the changes in Steem market price and incoming delegation volume, we are still eager to incentivize and encourage open source contributions across all categories. To ensure this, the maximal upvote percentage for all categories will be raised until further notice. Category Max Cap suggestions 30% development 70% bug-hunting 30% translations 55% graphics 50% analysis 60% social 40% documentation 40% tutorials 40% video-tutorials 50% copywriting 40% blog 40% task requests 10% Note that these values may change in the future, and we will be sure to update you in advance. Support Utopian and Get Higher Contribution Post PayoutsYou can help support our growth and get up to 20% more on your upvote value! How? By setting @utopian.pay as a beneficiary of 5% or more on your Utopian contributions. Our voting system will not only ensure you get that value back, but will also award you a higher payout for your support of Utopian.io through post beneficiaries. As of today, we’ve doubled the added supporter incentive from 10% on the original score value, to 20%. You can do this by using @Steem-Plus or Steeditor.app to submit your contribution. Community Manager and Moderator Content Writing IncentivesWith the public beta release of Utopian v2 closer than ever it’s time to start preparing the content to compliment that platform and begin outlining our community knowledge base. And who is better to tackle such a challenge than our team of professional community managers and moderators? Currently, the majority of valuable information for Utopian.io contributors is scattered around the blockchain in posts and comments, and much of the experience and knowledge of community managers and moderators remain unshared. We want to change that, and incentivize our team to share their expertise and experience with you. We are looking for well-written posts to be written by community managers and moderators, that can be of use and benefit to the community as well as, potentially, integrated into the knowledge base of Utopian v2. Among others, we’ll be happy to read and review: Tips and recommendations for contributors to various categories Lists of useful tools for contributors and moderators in various categories Helpful resource repositories and link collections Best practices in specific categories Personal experiences and lessons learned in community management and moderation roles These contributions will be reviewed by the Utopian.io core team members personally, and scored according to the category guidelines for Blogs. To ensure your contribution is reviewed, please include the tag #iamutopian in addition to #utopian-io and #blog categories. Questions? Don’t hesitate to ask in the #iamutopian channel on the Utopian.io Discord. One Last Thing… With the Utopian.io mini-hackathon taking place on September 20th, the content team and contributors will have its own unique role in the planned activities, so stay tuned for surprises and updates.

The Utopian History Quiz by @amosbastian Last Chance to Support Utopian and SteemSTEM Meetup on Fundition Get Ready for The Utopian.io Hackathon! Utopian Discord Optimization &amp; Ad CampaignAiming to bring more people to join the Utopian community and enhance the overall Utopian experience, we’ve decided to reorganize the community Discord server to accommodate newcomers outside the blockchain. As we drive the community focus to open source development and growth beyond the Steem ecosystem, we would like to move the conversation away from Utopian contribution incentives and moderation processes. In addition, this growth beyond the Steem blockchain demands we facilitate and welcome people with different skill sets. We’ve revamped and refreshed the channel list including a dedicated channel to introduce yourself to the community and show off your open source projects and creations. Everyone has something to offer, and our goal is to create a place for collaboration and networking for contributors and supporters of open source. To expedite the growth of our community, we’ve dedicated a budget to sponsored targeted ads on Reddit and Facebook. If you spot the ad, let us know and don’t forget to join our Discord server! Collaboration with Steem Power Box As you know, Utopian support extends not only to contributors to open source, but also Steem blockchain initiatives that help grow and develop the Steem ecosystem. One of the latest additions to the list of initiatives Utopian supports is Steem Power Box by @leotrap in Uruguay. This unique initiative combines promotion of eco-responsibility and the Steem blockchain in Uruguay by providing means to collect used batteries at convenient places while spreading the word about Steem to bring more people to the ecosystem. To help with funding efforts, Utopian has joined @sndbox and @fundition in providing @leotrap with resources and help in project execution. How Well Do You Know Us? The Utopian History Quiz by @amosbastian Utopian has existed, grown and developed in its months of activity to become a culture and community of its own. To reminisce and look back, we prepared a little contest for our community. @amosbastian collected data from the past and put together a simple quiz to test your knowledge about Utopian contribution history. To make it interesting, we attached a sweet reward for the commenter with the most correct answers. You can check the results of the quiz here. Congratulations to @codingdefined for winning the prize! Last Chance to Support Utopian and SteemSTEM Meetup on Fundition To fund the travel and meetup expenses for both SteemSTEM and Utopian.io meetup and hackathon attendees to Italy, we ran a mutual crowdfunding campaign with SteemSTEM. The campaign updates and posts included information about the meetup, its location and planned activities including the Utopian.io Hackathon. The campaign has been running for weeks, and this is the last one, so this is your last chance to pitch in and support.

Internet? What Internet?The morning was a bit of a challenge due to connectivity issues. The Internet in middle-of-nowhere Tuscany is unbearably slow and unreliable. Who would have thought? We tried a lot of tricks and tweaks but the Internet connection is simply too slow to allow anything resembling a Dtube or Dlive stream both on the local connection and our mobile broadband, that proved to be just as unstable.

It is crucial that you read the all the rules applicable to your specialization category before making a submission to Utopian.io Notable ChangesIn addition to extensive clarification of all existing rules and examples for approved contributions, we’ve also added some rules that have significant impact on the criteria for submission approval. Due to potential legal repercussions, accepted submissions to the Graphics, Visibility and Copywriting categories must include proof of project owner request for work done, either via Utopian task request (Influencer task request) or other verifiable form of approval and encouragement on behalf of the project owner. Submissions to the Visibility category must now include proof of engagement as per metric set in the rules. These metrics may change in future rule updates. Submissions of contributions to repositories that contain no code (like gitbooks, content repositories, etc.) will be rejected (in most cases). Utopian.io now demands tighter integration with github both for the submission and approval of contributions. The Moderation Team &amp; YouThe role of the rules is to provide contributors with guidelines, but are in no way a replacement for common sense. To ensure that the contributions rewarded by Utopian.io are valuable and beneficial to the open source community, moderators and supervisors may reject submissions of contributions they deem as having little to no notable value. Work in ProgressAs we continue to work with CrowdIn on streamlining and optimizing the process of proofing translations for open source projects on the platform, the translations category remains closed for contributions. Utopian.io is a work in progress, growing and evolving as more contributors (but also scammers) find their way to the platform. The new and updated rules should make it easier for valid contributions to get rewards and minimize abuse of the platform. However, these rules will be changed and adjusted in the future as Utopian.io continues to revolutionize the open source economy with your help. We look forward to reading your thoughts and insights on the new rules published so we can continue improving them to empower the Open Source community worldwide. Utopian Community-Driven Witness We are made of developers, system administrators, entrepreneurs, artists, content creators, thinkers. We embrace every nationality, mindset and belief. Utopian.io is the first Community-Driven Witness. Every decision will be taken as per the consensus of the entire community using our public Discord server and soon via a public voting system.

Thanks to your support and witness votes, we are in a position to continue contributing to the Steem ecosystem. Utopian &amp; HF20While @utopian-io was jumping in and out the top 20 during the Hard Fork, we were paying more attention to the actual upgrade, following discussions with the other witnesses and challenging us making sure to be among the first ones applying the patches as they happened. In addition to our involvement and engagement in the upgrade process, the Utopian Open Source Radio Show this week hosted a number of prominent witnesses who were kind enough to join the conversation to help clarify the state of things on the blockchain. Our thanks to @themarkymark, @pharesim, @lukestokes, @reggaemuffin and @therealwolf for their insights! The full show recording will be published in the following days. Utopian Witness Setup &amp; Full NodeCurrently, Utopian has both main and backup witnesses running Steem 0.20.3 on 64GB DDR3 RAM dedicated machines. The Utopian witness servers are managed by @helo, who also runs his own witness server, and is charged with maintaining and updating the witness server, and responding to emergencies or issues when needed. In coordination with Gregory , our CTO, and the whole development team in Utopian, the witness servers are professionally maintained to provide maximal uptime and reliability. As Utopian stabilises its position in the top 20 witnesses, we are looking to setup a public full node and we are already in the process of gathering all the requirements. What Utopian is doing for the Steem EcosystemUtopian has been empowering Open Source on the Steem blockchain, by utilizing its voting power to score and incentivise contributions to awesome projects and applications, many of which are based on the Steem blockchain. One of our key roles on the blockchain has been to serve as a bridge between many open source developers and the Steem blockchain. We’ve done this not only by offering incentives, but also by making sure to guide newcomers through the journey, and providing them with the tools and exposure to help their open source projects thrive. With the Steem blockchain being the birthplace of Utopian, it only makes sense that our support of open source projects is focused first and foremost on projects on the Steem blockchain. Many of the tools, applications and Steem initiatives you know (and use) are able to grow and thrive through the support of Utopian. Among the initiatives and projects supported by Utopian: Quasar Framework https://steemit.com/@quasarframework. The stellar Node + Vue framework with over 7000 stars on Github. Byteball https://steemit.com/@byteball.org. A cryptocurrency platform for mass world adoption. EFTG by the Blockchain Competence Centre of the European Commission. A system that offers a single view of the information currently stored at different Member States’ infrastructures built with the Steem blockchain. Beem by @holger80. The python library to easily interact with the Steem blockchain, now used by hundreds of developers and widely accepted as the standard. SteemPress https://steemit.com/@steempress-io. SteemPress brings Steem to WordPress. Now at over 1M delegated voting power. D.tube https://steemit.com/@dtube. The most relevant decentralised platform for hosting and streaming video. eSteem https://steemit.com/@esteemapp. Mobile and Desktop app for the Steem blockchain. SteemSTEM https://steemit.com/@steemstem . The STEM community on the Steem blockchain. Utopian is proud to help such an ingenious initiative. SteemPlus https://steemit.com/@steem-plus.

A mobile application that rewards you with both STEEM &amp; AFIT tokens for your fitness activities. Hede.io https://steemit.com/@hede-io. The knowledge sharing dictionary to replace Wikipedia on Steem. SteemHunt https://steemit.com/@steemhunt. The Steem application that rewards you for digging awesome products. Peer.query https://steemit.com/@peerquery. Peer to peer collaboration powered by Steem. KnackSteem, SndBox, Busy.org, 1UP, SteemMakers, SteemConnect, Archipelago, Steeditor, SwapSteem, Steemia, MineColonies, Steemqa, Steemnova, Hapramp(1Ramp)… and many more through the past year. We believe that by being a Steem witness in a prominent position, we can continue to grow our ability to further support these and other new projects born on the Steem blockchain every day. Power in NumbersThe Utopian Discord server is currently a central meeting place for hundreds of contributors, collaborating and conversing daily, striving and working to create innovative Steem projects. With a professional core community of over 40 members, specializing in development, content, community management, translations and more, we’re quickly becoming the main force driving the open source development community to the Steem blockchain. What is Utopian Up to Next?The development team at Utopian is labouring tirelessly to prepare the new Utopian frontend, Utopian.io v2, for launch. Though development is taking longer than anticipated, we assure you that this is only because we’re constantly working to bring a more complete, sustainable and scalable solution for the growth of our community. Currently, the base code for Utopian v2 is available on https://github.com/utopian-io/v2.utopian.io. The platform is being built using Vuejs and the Quasar Framework, and we will soon be allowing contributions to the repository, along with some tempting bounties for our awesome community of developers. With the new Utopian.io we hope to revolutionize the open source collaboration ecosystem and economy, ultimately coming closer to the Utopian global vision - empowering open source. It is our hope you will choose to join us on this journey, and support our activity on the Steem blockchain by casting one of your witness votes for utopian-io and helo.

Our radio show will be back! Back in business!Due to the big HF20 mana depletion, we were out of comission for a few days. But now we’re back as a fully operational ~~death star~~ open source promoting machine. New HiringsWe are delighted to announce that @gregory.latinier has joined Utopian as our CTO. Grégory is a full stack developer, and has been instrumental in developing Busy.org. We can also reveal that @didic, who has been a moderator and contributor to our Content department, has come on board as Chief Content Officer. He is very embrassed, because he (well, me) is the one writing this post. Open Sourcing ScienceThis week, @lemouth announced an incredible new project that we are proud to take part in along with SteemStem. In this project, a group of developers will create an open source, Python-based, version of FeynRules that anyone could run for free, without having to rely on the very expensive Mathematica framework. What’s FeynRules? Well, it’s complicated, so click the above link to find out! SteemStem CommentsWe’re also starting a different collaboration with our friends from @SteemStem. Starting tomorrow, any post voted by SteemStem with a voting strength above 50% will receive a steemstem comment including the utopian logo, plus an incentive to support Utopian as Witness. The text may still slightly change, but here is the preview: Task Requests Ahoy!One of the most intriguing devlopments coming to Steem is @steem-1up’s SMT and support of communities on the blockchain. We’ve supported 1UP from the start, and this week they had an interesting TR, looking for developers to create a loot box system for airdrops and cards. Fun! In addition to the Utopian reward, 1UP is offering 50,000 UP tokens for the Loot Box system and another 25,000 UP tokens for a well animated content reveal for the loot box. Another TR we’re happy to see is one that was suggested by a Utopian moderator in response to a post looking for a logo designer. @irelandscape is looking for someone to design a logo for StemQ, the open source STEM focused Q&amp;A system.

As Utopian’s impact grows beyond the Steem blockchain, we want to keep supporting our birthplace by creating initiatives specifically tailored to improve some of the most prominent pain points. As a Steem Witness, Utopian aims to empower the steem blockchain by providing bespoke solutions. The anti-abuse initiative fits that bill perfectly. Utopian Anti-AbuseUtopian wants to spread knowledge, awareness and participation around the anti-abuse efforts being made daily by many awesome members of our beloved Steem communities. Anti-Abuse is a new category available in Utopian and its guidelines are available on https://join.utopian.io/guidelines. This is how to find them: The Utopian anti-abuse initiative will incentivise the best abuse figthers of the Steem blockchain for providing and sharing their knowledge, projects, initiatives, analyses, ideas, tools, and more. Our aim is to make this knowledge available to everyone. Additionally, Utopian wants to support the great work being done by abuse fighters by providing incentives for their efforts. An ExperimentThe anti-abuse initiative will run for one month as an experimental trial run. After the first month, we will take a short break of 10 days to do an internal audit and resume the improved category immediately after. It’s important to notice that the Anti-abuse category is, for the time being, “whitelist only”. Once the trial period ends, and depending on how we choose to proceed, we may provide you with the details needed to enter the whitelist. The TeamWe couldn’t be happier to see our team growing. We want to welcome @iamstan as the new Community Manager for the Anti-abuse category. He has been absolutely amazing and incredibly fast in setting up the requirements for the category. We also want to thank @lovenfreedom, @enforcer48, and all the people behind SteemCleaners and SteemFlagRewards for their support in setting up the guidelines and the quality questionnaire to make this new initiative a reality.

Let’s catch up. In this post: Welcoming Rocket.Chat to VIPO Big witness update Welcoming @Suesa Big Tasks, Big TRs Build Utopian.io v2 with us! Our radio show is back! Welcoming Rocket.Chat to VIPO For the second week in a row, we have a huge addition to our VIPO (Very Important Project Owners) club: Rocket.Chat. As covered in the announcement, they are a fast-growing communication and collaboration platform that is now installed on over 180k servers and counts over 10m users worldwide as well as having an active, passionate community of over 700 developer-contributors who help Rocket.Chat’s core team of developers to constantly improve the product. Big witness updateAs covered in this announcement post, We’ve recently upgraded our server’s hardware. As part of the upgrade, our main and backup servers are located in different countries with different providers in an effort to decentralise and remove single points of failure. We also doubled the RAM on the production server. The biggest news in regards to the Utopian-io witness is that we finally have a seed node at seed.utopian.io:2001. This is something we’ve wanted to do for some time, and we are very glad to have it up and running. Welcoming @Suesa This was also announced in the big witness announcement post, but it deserves its own headline here: We have a new COO! @Suesa isn’t just a future mad scientist, she is a Steem powerhouse who comes to us from @steemstem. During her trial period, she has already added order and discipline and a whole bunch of Jira tasks. That’s what happens when you put the self proclaimed “scary German” in charge. We love you, @Suesa! Big Tasks, Big TRsWe’ve had a couple of huge task requests this week. @lemouth’s incredibly ambitious idea of running a full particle physics research project on Steem is starting to take shape with a TR about Managing particle physics model information in Python. The second one, from @surpassinggoogle, is for ulogs.org, and is about creating a bot which can vote and comment but shaped for communities. Click the links for all the info! Build Utopian.io v2 with us!As you probably know, our development team has been hard at work in creating the base for the next Utopian.io, with features and functionalities requested by the community. If you’re a developer and want to help, visit our repo and take a look. Utopian.io Open Source Radio Show on MSP Waves We had another huge, huge, huge radio show this week. Following up on last week’s addition of an Anti-abuse category to Utopian, we hosted some of Steem’s biggest abuse fighters for a talk about the state of the blockchain. We had @SteemCleaners’ founder @patrice, blacklist creator (and semi-regular guest) @themarkymark, our very own Anti-abuse category manager (and also @steemflagrewards powerhouse) @iamstan, @steemcleaners and Utopian abuse fighter @Naturicia, @steemcleaners abuse fighter and witness @guiltyparties, and @helpie founder and witness @meno. The discussion was lively, to say the least. Be sure to tune in next week at 6PM UTC on Wednesday on MSP Waves!

We’ve been hard at work behind the scenes on things we can’t announce yet, and preparing for Steemfest. But we do have a couple of major task requests and a brand new VIPO manager. And we’ve had yet another huge episode of our radio show. Let’s catch up. In this post: Two huge tasks Welcoming @lovenfreedom Upgraded nodes Build Utopian.io v2 with us! Huge radio show episode! Two huge tasksWe have great task requests just about every week these days, but this week stands out. The first of the two major tasks comes from our friends at the European Commission EFTG Project (European Financial Transparency Gateway)-Project), who have a TR to develop a live witnesses status monitor map in the Block Explorer web interface. The second major task requst comes from our very own @knowledges, who is putting up a massive 800 Steem bounty for a big task: Improving @knacksteem’s front end. The bounty is split up into specific tasks as detailed in the post. knacksteem is a great Steem condencer by one of our key people, and we are delighted to help facilitate this request. Welcoming @lovenfreedomAs you may know, we’ve been looking for someone to take over our VIPO (Very Important Task Owners) club. That position is now filled, as the excellent @lovenfreedom has taken it on. @lovenfreedom, the self described lady farmer trapped in the matrix, is a moderator for our new Anti-abuse category, and a veteran abuse fighter on Steem. She’s super smart, very talented, and we’re absolutely delighted to have her on board. This is the last major position we were looking to fill before Steemfest and Utopian V2. Upgraded nodesAs detailed last week, we’ve stepped up our game as a Steem Witness. As part of that, we’ve now upgraded our production, backup, and seed nodes to version 20.6 of Steem.

Utopian.io Open Source Radio Show on MSP Waves We had another great radio show this week, which ties in very nicely with our news.

Total payout: 5.74 STU Number of votes: 178 Flagging comment spam is a regular part of curation. Let’s learn how! by @steemseph [anti-abuse] This is one of the best posts for the new antiabuse category. @steemseph explains how to find spam content on mobile devices and on personal computers. This work is very helpful to anyone who would like to curb abuse on steem dApps. @steemseph uses some humor, and despite being a long post it is easy to read. You will enjoy his way of teaching you about this very important subject to proper curation on steem dApps. Total payout: 3.36 STU Number of votes: 65 Tutorial: Defensive programming in Python; Using and extending the typeconstraints module by @mattockfs [tutorials] @mattockfs brings us another great tutorial, that sheds light on using defensive programming techniques. He focuses on typeconstraints, a Python library. For all python lovers and enthusiasts, this is a recommended tutorial to help avoid certain limitations and/or potential coding issues. Those could otherwise easily waste hours and hours of debugging, and/or cause incorrect output of your scripts.

We worked hard every day to get there and today we are going to propose the biggest rule update we have ever done.. This update will have an impact for all the Utopian contributors, we strongly suggest to review all the new rules before contributing. All the posts submitted before this announcement will be reviewed as per the old rules, all the new posts will have to bind to the new rules. The Translations Category is now opened again. You can submit new contributions in that category as long as they bind to the new rules https://utopian.io/rulesEditor TemplatesWhen creating a new contribution or task request, now the Editor will propose predefined templates for each category that contributors should follow. Example: Sample Template for Video Tutorials What Will I Learn?Write here briefly the details of what the user is going to learn in a bullet list. - You will learn Example A - You will learn Example B - You will learn Example C RequirementsWrite here a bullet list of the requirements for the user in order to follow this tutorial. - Example Requirement A - Example Requirement B - Example Requirement C DifficultyEither choose between the following options: - Basic - Intermediate - Advanced Tutorial ContentsA full description of the topics of this video tutorial, plus the contents of the tutorial itself. CurriculumPlace here a list of related tutorials you have already shared on Utopian that make up a Course Curriculum, if applicable. - Example Tutorial A - Example Tutorial B - Example Tutorial C - Example Tutorial D Immediate RejectionWe proposed to reduce the waiting period after a moderator requests for a change to 24 hours, but then realised there should be no waiting period at all. Contributors are enforced to read all the rules before contributing. They won’t have a chance to edit, the contribution will be either accepted or rejected. Significant Rules Changes Translations minimum 1000 words. Translations must have been done no longer than a week before the contribution. The same for code contributions. Tutorials and Video Tutorials can be now only about highly technical how-tos that have coding implications. If your account on an external platform does not match the Steem/Utopian account you must either change it or use another field to show you are the author. Screenshots of you logged in other platforms won’t be accepted any longer. Other significant rules have been changed. Review them all on https://utopian.io/rules On The HorizonModeration Editing FunctionalitiesSoon moderators will be able to change category, repository and tags on behalf of the contributor since It is there where we have the biggest amount of mistakes. Moderation Questionnaire and Quality SliderSoon moderators will have to fill a short questionnaire and assign a quality to each reviewed contribution. The Utopian Bot will mainly take into consideration the quality assigned as a factor to decide the voting weight.

We have been testing the voting distribution for over an year. We’ve seen how it affects the rewards, and therefore the usage behavior, quantity, and quality of the contributions incentivised by Utopian. It is clear that rewarding everyone is unsustainable, and the new bot, just released yesterday, takes this simple fact into account. The Issues No amount of delegation or stake can guarantee scalability of incentives with the aim of rewarding everyone. Delegation itself is not a sustainable component for an organisation wishing to grow and walk on its own two feet. Incentivising each and every contribution does not produce positive competition. Every contributor expects a reward, whatever the quality provided. Distributing the rewards to everyone lowers the value available to high quality contributions, making the rewards distribution potentially unfair or insignificant in the long run. Focusing solely on Utopian as a source of rewards is against the basic principle of decentralization. The community has to buy into the system to grow their own incentives and those of others, independently from what Utopian can deliver. Distributing the rewards across all categories, based on the numbers of contributions received per category, hurts the opportunities categories with lower participation have to grow, as categories with a bigger number of contributions consume the voting power that could have pushed those categories forward. Collision between the rewards assigned to Utopian contributions and those followed by the trail, when the queue was growing too fast, often denying the trail the opportunity to catch valuable posts from the trailed communities. The SolutionsThe solutions the new voting bot provides aim to bring to the table a sustainable voting distribution. This distribution is biased toward quality and not quantity, as it should for our long term aims. Precedence of the scoreThe Utopian Quality Score is assessed by our moderation teams, comprising over 50 professionals in their respective fields. The score is what makes the Utopian engine work, reducing abuse and supporting professional quality assurance on the platform. In the last 2 months, our dedication to moderation processes has been immense. We have collected dozens of materials and publications to create a new version of the guidelines, suitable to assure quality for organisations of all sizes, implementing industry standards across all the categories. A new Utopian quality questionnaire is also in the works. This new questionnaire will guarantee more granular and accurate reviews. Utopian v2 will bring multiple reviews per contribution, which will help our quality assurance become even more professional and fair for everyone. The new voting bot will give precedence in the queue to contributions with the highest score and will consume the available voting power daily to reward those. We are very proud of this new approach. It incentives positive competition across all contributions, and turns the voting distribution into a sustainable system. In this new system the minimum quality to get an Utopian incentive is dictated by the community itself, and the value it can provide. Reserved PoolsOne of the main issues with our previous voting bot was that categories with higher contributions were consuming most of the incentives that would otherwise be available categories with lower participation. This is why the new voting bot reserves the same amount of voting power pool for each category and dynamically shares the pool between all the categories as demand requires. If a category goes over the reserved pool assigned, it can share the reserved pool of categories that are not not using theirs up, until those categories grow enough to consume their reserved pools. This change assures each category can grow at its own rate. The TrailUtopian incentivises awesome initiatives with which we share vision and effort, such as @SteemStem, @steemmakers, MSP-Waves, and others. Quite often our voting bot hasn’t been able to reward these contributions due to the internal queue growing too fast and denying the trailed communities our incentives. To fix that, the new voting bot reserves a pool for the trail as well. Just as it does for our own contributions, the queue will be biased toward the highest quality contributions. Technical DetailsIf you wish to learn more about the technical details of the new bot and the story behind it, have a look at https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@amosbastian/developing-the-new-utopian-bot To sum upThe new voting bot will make sure to prioritise the best of the best. As a ongoing contest, running 24 hours and 7 days a week, only the best contributions will access Utopian’s incentives. We hope our community of contributors and project owners will challenge itself to provide the best quality. That is how you can win the Utopian’s ongoing contest. We also believe the new voting bot will sustain the growth of the communities we support outside Utopian, under the same framework Utopian has adopted. Credits@Amosbastian is the tireless machine behind the creation of the new voting bot, which can be found here https://github.com/utopian-io/utopian-bot. We also want to thank: @scipio @crokkon @espoem @holger80 @miniature-tiger @nothingismagick For helping set up the requirements for the bot, spotting issues and providing input to improve the codebase structure and scalability of the bot.

If you want to know how to best contribute to Utopian, reading these posts is an excellent idea. This week, you’ll find contributions from the Analysis, Translation, Blog, Tutorials, and two from Anti-abuse! Staff PicksDon’t cast worthless votes - zero-value votes in HF20 by @crokkon [analysis] This was a good week for quality analysis contributions, including a resteem from @ned for @paulag’s exploratory analysis on benefactor rewards. However, this week’s staff pick goes to @crokkon, for another excellent analysis of vote values, and how Hard Fork 20 has affected them. The changes have meant many votes sacrificing rShares, and the findings report that whilst there is still a number of votes turning to ‘dust’, voting percentages have risen on average in order to compensate for this. The report is excellently presented, and supported with clear and understandable charts. It concludes that vote percentages, particularly with regards to trail votes, should be reassessed to avoid having no value. Total payout: 115.14 STU Number of votes: 169 [Translation][Spanish] Node.js, from English (1090 words) [N’15] by @alejohannes [translations] The translator has done an excellent job with perfect accuracy. As noted by the Spanish moderator, the writing style is correct and most appropriate for the Spanish language. The translator has also put in a detailed effort to write out an overview of the translation process and what he had learned, especially in explaining the Module System and Code Refactoring. We appreciate the personal touch he put into writing the submission post. Total payout: 1.62 STU Number of votes: 105 Introducing Contest Hero - Create contests on the Steem by @contest-hero [blog] We had some stellar contributions in the Blog category this week, and picking the best one was not easy. Posts by @actifit, @jaff8, and @the1ramp were all worthy. I ended up selecting @contest-hero’s post for writing quality, beyond the excellent content all of these posts shared. @tobias-g’s introduction of Contest Hero was just well done in all aspects. Not only is the project itself exciting, it was also well presented, and well illustrated with screenshots. This is the sort of post one can later point to and say “this is how you do that.” Total payout: 219.34 STU Number of votes: 223 Machine learning and Steem #5: Account classification - understanding and using Ensemble Methods + tweaking performance by @jacekw.dev [tutorials] Another beautiful tutorial by @jacekw.dev, tackling the aspects of his (and many’s) favorite topic: account classification on the Steem blockchain. Using machine learning techniques, he provides an approach to use a diverse set of Ensemble methods. He leads the reader in the proper steps to utilize and implement those methods, while explaining the differences and the relevant results. Great dynamic charts throughout the tutorial make it simply a feast for the eyes. We await further work, particularly as the API of his classifier works becomes available in upcoming contributions. Total payout: 42.07 STU Number of votes: 182 Copy/Paste: Friends With Controls (C + V) by @lovenfreedom [anti-abuse] This was the best week yet for the new antiabuse category. We had 5 very good contributions this week. This is the second time @Lovenfreedom’s has been a staff pick. This recent contribution, about copy/paste, shows how to detect this type of abuse. By simply watching the “New page,” she teaches you what copy/paste is and how to find and report it to @steemcleaners. @Lovenfreedom’s antiabuse series is easy to follow, and everybody should read it. Total payout: 75.59 STU Number of votes: 51 Plagiarism &amp; Cheetah - An Antiabuse Series #1 by @iamstan [anti-abuse] The anti-abuse category aims to fight abuse and educate users on the Steem blockchain. Utopian reward users trying to keep the Steem blockchain free from abuse. This is an excellent post by the category manager, who did not select it as a staff pick. So we did. This contribution presents vital information on how to report abuses to @steemcleaners, as well as detecting plagiarism in any publication. We hope to keep seeing more anti-abuse efforts like this. If you wish to participate, consider going through this post to understand how to present your effort. Total payout: 83.42 STU Number of votes: 50 Utopian.io Post StatisticsThe staff picked contributions are only a small (but exceptional) example of the mass of contributions reviewed and rewarded by Utopian.io. Overall, the last week saw a total of 232 posts, with 112 of them rewarded through an upvote by @utopian-io. In total, Utopian.io distributed an approximate of 4834.15 STU to contributors. The highest payout seen on any Utopian.io contribution this week was 219.34 STU, with a total of 223 votes received from the community. The contribution that attracted the most engagement was Dynamic sitemap.xml for Steemdocs.net, with no less than 6 comments in its comment threads. The average vote given by Utopian.io was worth 42.40 STU.

Here’s everything you need to know! In this post: New Voting Bot! Amazing Tasks! Come To Our Presentation at Steemfest! Build Utopian.io v2 with us! Huge radio show episode! New Voting Bot We’ve been busy working on Utopian V2, and two of this week’s updates are related to this massive undertaking. The first is the launch of our new voting bot. This bot is our solution to major issues of sustainability: With more and more contributions being reviewed, and voting power a finite resource, how can we reward the best of the best? And with some categories more active than others, how can we make sure the rewards are distributed fairly? As you can read in the announcement post, our solution is to prioritize highly reviewed contributions, as well as sharing the voting power reserve pools between categories as needed. If you want the technical side, read @amosbastian’s post about developing the new bot. Amazing Tasks!We’ve had some truly awesome task requests this week, and we’ll highlight the two presented by members of our VIPO club. Our friends at @byteball have a tutorial task request for Byteduino, their co-signer library for Arduino based chips. If you’ve got what it takes to make this tutorial, this task is still open, and the bounty is already quite significant. Our pals at @coingecko have a task request for Ruby developers. They need help with public WebSocket API connections for Exchanges for Cryptoexchange, a rubygem that allows Ruby developers to interact with over 240+ cryptocurrency exchange market data APIs in a single library. This rubygem is used to power CoinGecko. This TR is also still open, and has a nice bounty. Come To Our Presentation at Steemfest!As you probably know, Steemfest 3 is next week! The celebration of all things Steem will take place in Kraków, Poland, and we’ll be there! We will be part of the “Wall of dApps” expo, of course. But if you want to be the first to have a glimpse of Utopian V2, the place and time to be will be the main stage, at 10:50 on Thursday. That’s where our CEO, @elear, and our CMO, @techslut, will present the design and main features of Utopian V2, and give attendees a chance to see the future. If you miss the presentation, or have questions about it, do visit us at our booth at the expo. Build Utopian.io v2 with us!As you probably know, our development team has been hard at work in creating the base for the next Utopian.io, with features and functionalities requested by the community. If you’re a developer and want to help, visit our repo and take a look. Utopian.io Open Source Radio Show on MSP Waves We had another great radio show this week, focusing on two things people love: Games and music. On the gaming side, we had one of the developers from chainbreakers.io, a strategy-RPG that runs on the Etherium blockchain using Decentraland’s MANA token. On the music side, we had Dale, who develops plugins for open source synthesizer VCV Rack. As she does every week, the excellent @techslut delivered the FOSS news. And our brand new VIPO manager @lovenfreedom won the raffle. A great time was had by all! Be sure to tune in next week at 6PM UTC on Wednesday on MSP Waves!

This week, we feature posts from the Development, Anti-abuse, Blog, Tutorials, and Translations categories. These are the best of the best. Read them to know what it takes. Staff PicksDeveloping the new Utopian bot by @amosbastian [development] After several days during which Utopian received a large number of contributions, a new voting bot was needed. None other than @amosbastian took the task to improve the bot, so that contributions with higher scores are not excluded, which means that contributions that are of lesser quality do not stay at the top of the voting queue. In his post, @amosbastian introduced the issue and described the needed changes. Unlike in the past, the bot now votes for 3 different types of content: The comments written by reviewers, the contributions, and selected trails. Total payout: 122.52 STU Number of votes: 122 Introducing ‘Competition Pools’ on 1Ramp - With 2 Ongoing Contests by @the1ramp [development] With this update 1Ramp has made hosting contests on Steem much easier. From creating contests to announcing results, the entire process can now be done with 1Ramp’s Android app. The amount of work and attention to detail that has gone into this contribution is a great example for other contributors! Total payout: 93.16 STU Number of votes: 48 Removing delegations from faucet abusers by @crokkon [anti-abuse] This was a great week for the antiabuse category. Starting with @crokkon, the quality of the contributions exceeded our expectations. Crokkon’s post about unwinding a faucet delegation vote farm educates the steem blockchain community about a type of abuse most have never heard of. This post teaches you how to find and recognize a vote farm. Then, it shows you what needs to be done to remove the delegations and return them to steemit inc. This is an eye opener to many who may think there is no reason to fight abuse on the platform. Read this post and learn about the Irredeemables. Total payout: 152.11 STU Number of votes: 177 The Creative Crypto Magazine [A Global Steem-Powered Publication] by @sndbox [blog] In the Blog category, we’re always striving for posts that are at a high professional level. This post by @sndbox is exactly what we’re looking for. The writing is crisp and clear, and the post is beautifully illustrated. While the project itself is only open source thanks to its front end, it is a magazine that is of interest to all Steemians with an interest in quality writing and lovely art. We are very happy to be able to highlight it as a staff pick. Total payout: 237.14 STU Number of votes: 480 Writing a simple Compiler on my own - Type Declaration and Checking [C][Flex][Bison] by @drifter1 [tutorials] Another well-crafted part in @drifter1’s series about creating your own C compiler. As we progress through the different steps of this process, the author takes us in a very coherent, well-detailed approach into finalizing all the prep work needed to get the compiler fully up and running. In this phase, type declarations are presented along with type checking and integrating with the symbol table. We look forward to the next steps in bringing this compiler to reality. According to the author, those will involve semantic analysis, intermediate and machine code generation. Total payout: 39.67 STU Number of votes: 107 Abuse Series: Call to Action by @enforcer48 [anti-abuse] This is the second staff pick for the Antiabuse category. @enforcer48 has built a beautiful and entertaining contribution. It walks the reader smoothly through a type of abuse that is very debated on the platform: Bid Bot abuse. Through a tip in a comment from a thoughtful steemian, a web of deception is exposed. Because this person changed their identity and used bid bots, they were also caught plagiarizing content from the web. This article shows that many of the well known bid bot owners do care about abuse and are willing to remove votes from the abusive accounts. Don’t miss this great post, that starts with an account at 56 rep and ends at a -6 rep. Total payout: 111.69 STU Number of votes: 116 [Translation][Spanish] Node.js (1597 words) (Part 30) by @dedicatedguy [translations] The translator translated 1,597 words accurately. He explained the dynamics of changelog commits and definition of important terms learned during the translation process. Readers of the post can now know what TLS and dotfiles are. He also added a few examples of the translated content and correct terminologies used in the translation.

Roadmap inside. Building a sustainable business on Steem.","text":"The hot topic for dApps at this year’s @SteemFest was how to build a sustainable business on the Steem blockchain. Utopian has been focusing for the past year on creating a business that scales and can walk on its own two feets. Find out what we’ve learned. Building a sustainable business is no easy game, and it becomes even harder for initiatives like ours, working on pioneering blockchain technologies. Utopian has gathered thousands of use cases, building Utopian V2 to meet the needs of open source projects and contributors. Established a bit over a year ago, Utopian has been empowering open source projects on the Steem blockchain and beyond through continuous support. As Utopian was born on the Steem blockchain, our commitment to it is immense. We appreciate the positive feedback from the community, which has chosen us as one of the consensus witnesses. Utopian, which began as a proof-of-concept fork of Busy.org, has proved to have the necessary ingredients to become a full-featured product. The success of the Utopian POC is shown by the numbers: We’ve incentivised more than 65,000 contributions, embraced over 5,000 professionals and supported almost 9,000 open source projects. Utopian is a data-driven project. Thanks to our POC, we have learned a lot. As in every learning process, challenges are inevitable. Where monetary incentives are involved, abuse is always around the corner. Continuous audits are necessary to make sure the framework can mitigate them. Retention is another challenge every dApp has faced. The volatility of the market, and especially the current bearish trends, make retention hard. It is critical to highlight long-term benefits and build incentives beyond the monetary ones. You can never have enough security. It is critical to dedicate a great deal of attention to the topic. One must consider the weak points of both the infrastructure and the organisation. Cost &amp; sustainability is the biggest challenge a dApp on the blockchain faces. It is critical to consider the importance of balancing INs and OUTs. Specifically for the Steem blockchain, it is important to keep in mind the unreliability of delegated stake. Monetary incentives are definitely not the only incentives Utopian can offer, and we believe the focus shouldn’t be fully on them. The right community is the one which sees the long-term benefits and contributes to the greater mission. This is where our full focus has been and will remain. As the community is such a critical component, we have been very careful in on-boarding and supporting the right members. Our core team is indeed made up of some of the best community members. Through hard work and commitment, they have demonstrated the skills and will to make Utopian a reality. Utopian counts 11 core members and over 50 reviewers and community managers across the world, speaking almost 30 languages. Overcoming our challenges wouldn’t have been possible without constantly learning from our partners. We are proud to support relevant open source initiatives on their journeys to build open source innovation. The Utopian POC was born on Steem and we are forever grateful. Utopian has been working hard to support the growth of the Steem blockchain. We’ve been proactive as a witness, encouraged the development of the blockchain and dApps, as well as incentivising education for the community. It’s about time to use the lessons we learnt to create a product aimed to solve effectively challenges and needs: Utopian V2. Utopian v.2 The Social Platform for Collaboration and Collective Funding of Open Source Innovation. Such a fancy sentence to say a simple thing: we have been working hard over the last year to gather as much data as possible to come up with a solution that really works for our audience. Open source projects are looking for spreading knowledge and awareness, building connections, and raising funds. Utopian has supported sharing knowledge since day 1 and we believe this is an important component to attracting more professionals to the blockchain and to the open source ecosystem, enabling valuable content for a variety of categories such as tutorials, analyses, project updates and more. To facilitate incentives for awesome content, Utopian V2 will enable you to send and receive liquid tips in a multitude of coins. Of those, STEEM will stand out, being super fast, featuring cost-free transactions, but most importantly being the only coin from which Utopian will get zero commissions. If you have been following Utopian, you have probably noticed that we have been running a bounty-alike system on the Steem account @utopian.tasks. Working with our partners and project mantainers, we have learned much. It is crystal clear to us that the community wants to have a voice when it comes to proposing changes. This is the reason that Utopian V2 will feature a decentralized bounty exchange, enabling project owners, project collaborators, as well as external contributors to host bounties and load them up. There’s a special sauce which makes the Utopian bounty exchange uniquely smart: Professional Quality Assurance. We have been supporting project owners and contributors in their decision making processes since the start. We have enabled them to make better and more informed decisions when distributing rewards. Utopian V2 will bring this powerful concept to the next level, as we have been gathering materials studies and industry standards to shift our quality assurance process and make it work for organisations of all sizes. Utopian wants to be the place for professional open source contributors. We want to give them an identity. You will be able to create detailed profiles, showing your carreer, education, as well as your activity and reputation built during your journey on the platform. As we want to build the bridge between contributors and projects, it makes sense to give these project a home. You will be able to create awesome pages for your open source projects, showing details, a personal blog and bounties pages. To make sure we can facilitate the connection between contributors and project maintainers, Utopian will feature an on-site messaging and notification system. The foundation of the messaging app is already available, have a look at this contribution from @Tensor. Utopian V2 is being built around two fundamental concepts: sustainability and mass adoption. The majority of the potential audience doesn’t know what the blockchain is, or is not confident enough to try and understand its complexities. This is why Utopian V2 gamifies users’ experience with the Steem blockchain and the other coins listed on the platform: Receive tips on articles and donations for your bounty solutions even if you don’t have a Steem wallet. Interact with Utopian by using standard, one-click, social oauth providers. Have the ability to choose whether to post your contributions to the blockchain or not. This will determine your ability to access SP rewards. As Steem remains the most important nexus for Utopian, we have made sure to highlight the benefits of using it compared to the other listed coins: Pay zero commissions on Steem tips. Access additional incentives thanks to the SP rewards capabilities. Withdraw your Steem balance instantly and automatically as soon as your Steem account is synced. All other coins will require manual verification up to 72 hours. A significant chunk of the commissions taken from all the coins, will be powered up to sustain the voting distribution and reviewers rewards, effectively growing the Steem ecosystem both directly and indirectly. Utopian V2 Roadmap You may have noticed we had to shift our deadline quite a few times. The reason for that is simple: We have collected almost 70K contributions, which to us represent 70K experiments and use cases. During our journey of building the platform, and as our partners have been growing, we have discovered functionalities we now view as critical for the success of our platform. We believe that we are at the point where we have gathered enough data to build a product that works. We have also had our issues and realised how much is important to have the right team. @Gregory.Latinier, our recently added CTO, has done an incredible job of splitting the work into tasks.

The Utopian V2 Presentation Great Tasks! Anti-abuse trial period done Great radio show episode! Utopian V2 tasks! We usually use the weekly to highlight some of the best task requests we’ve had during the past week. This week, those best task requests are our very own. Following his complete tutorial on how to contribute to utopian V2, CTO @gregory.latinier has posted three tasks. The first task posted, Project module, has already been assigned. But the other two, building the pro review module for our articles and building the language module for our articles are still open. One partner task that deserves further attention is Coingecko’s request to implement public websocket API connections for Coinbase Pro. You may remember it from last week’s Weekly, but no one has taken up the challenge yet. We also had some other great tasks, so be sure to check @utopian.tasks for all the details. The Utopian V2 Presentation If you want to know what you’ll be cotributing to, please take a look at our presentation from SteemFest (the fest may be in the rear window, but it is forever in our hearts). That post has the lessons we’ve learned, and our plans for the future. It is a must read. Anti-abuse trial period doneFor the last month, we’ve been running a trial for an Anti-abuse category at Utopian. That trial has ended, and we’ve now entered into a period of internal audit. We want to thank @iamstan and the entire team for the great job they’ve done with the category during the trial. It’s been a pleasure working with this group of dedicated abuse fighters. After applying what we’ve learned from this trial, you can expect the category to return with a vengeance. Abusers beware! Utopian.io Open Source Radio Show on MSP Waves Everything ties together this week, including our wonderful radio show, as CEO @elear visited the show to talk about the task requests linked to above. We also hosted @jringo from Gridcoin, to talk about Gridcoin’s new economical model and the change to their block rewards. They will now be fixed, which makes the coin more stable and more calculatable In addition to reporting the open source news, @techslut joined @elear to talk about SteemFest 3. We also had a fun raffle! Be sure to tune in next week at our new time of 7PM UTC on Wednesday on MSP Waves and on the Utopian Discord server!

With that in mind, we’re announcing our newest initiative: The Utopian Idea Hub. This project, which will be taking place in the Utopian Discord server, will allow people from different part of the world to come together. It will serve as a place for likeminded folks who are capable of providing a solution to almost any kind of problem. The heart of the hub will be a weekly radioshow on the Utopian Discord server. On this show, two guests will be able to come and present their ideas and suggestions to our dedicated community of developers, project owners, and tech savvy folks. We want to bring people together to start a discussion and have a brainstorming session to solve issues through open source software. Ultimately, we want to pave the way for people with unique ideas to bring them to fruition. This has always been one of the goals of the open source community. With Utopian empowering open source initiatives, we are limitless. If you have an idea, jump onboard the Utopian Discord server, visit the get-onair channel, and register your interest to appear on the show. We’re still finalizing the details of the show, the hosts and the time slot, and these will be announced in due time. Why are we doing this?We have many reasons for launching this initiative, which we believe is going to have a significant positive impact on the community and the world at large. We want to see more Unique ideas turn into a usable product. We feel that most ideas never come to fruition because of lack of funds and resources, or even lack of people to share the ideas with to turn them into reality. We are trying to close the gap between ideators and the developers who can help realize them and make them useful in the real world.

Utbot Is Listening! @Espoem has created Utbot, a new Discord bot that “listens to blockchain operations and waits for the right trigger. Its purpose is to gather necessary information about a Utopian task request and create a consistent message for a Discord server/channel.” This bot will help get the word out on Utopian task requests on Discord. And, being open source, people can use it for different triggers. So Many Tasks! We have a bunch of interesting TRs over in @utopian.tasks. Our own tasks this week have already been assigned, so make sure to follow both @utopian.tasks and Utopian CTO @gregory.latinier so as not to miss them when posted. We want to highlight the latest task request by our partners at @CoinGecko. They’re looking for a Ruby developer to implement public websocket API connections for Binance. With Binance’s prominence in the Cryptocurrency arena, this is obviously an important API to connect to. More About Anti-abuse’s Return In the last weekly, we announced the return of our Anti-abuse category. This week, we’ve got a post up with all of the information, including the most important part: The end of the Anti-abuse whitelist. If you’re engaged in fighting abuse on Steem, you’re welcome to join us. Please read the linked post for all the details. Utopian.io Open Source Radio Show on MSP Waves This week’s radio show took place a short time after the announcement of cuts to Steemit Inc, which definitely made for a fascinating show. We had one of Steem’s most important partners and witnesses, @blocktrades, on to talk about everything that’s going on plus their future plans. We also had tutorials master @tensor on, and pulled in @rhondak to talk about everything that’s going on. Past and future guest @nothingismagick chimed in with a fun rant about everything being open source. As usual, the illustrious @techslut had the open source news, and we ended with a raffle in which @natu won the Humble Warhammer Bunde.

As previously announced, this week was the debut of the Utopian IdeaHub, a new weekly show taking place in the Utopian discord server. This debut was something of a pilot episode for the show, as lessons learned from it when it comes back in the new year. In this pilot, @jedigeiss hosted two guests. @helo came in to pitch an idea for the Volentix project, and @Imacryptorick presented his idea about Steem revenue calculation in Fiat for tax purposes. DTrip Logo Task! With the holidays approaching, we’ve had less activity on the tasks front. However, @arval had an interesting one late in the week for designers in the audience. DTrip, the Steem based dApp for travelers, is looking for a new logo. Check out all the details in @arval’s post Utopian.io Open Source Radio Show on MSP Waves This week’s radio show was the last before the show takes a break to reload during the holidays. Appropriately, it was a festive Christmas special, with a plethora of guests and an avalanche of raffles. Think we’re exaggerating? Check this out: @Raycoms came on to talk about minecolonies. @aggroed showed up to discuss plans for decentralized SteemMonsters tournaments. @themarkymark talked about hopes for a more efficient Steem. @nothingismagic surprised us all by announcing Quasar 1.0. @didic gave a small preview of the upcoming Utopian guidelines. @therealwolf discussed his upcoming Steem Apps project. And, just when we thought the show was done, @punqtured arrived to talk about the new Byteball airdrop draw bot. Packed doesn’t begin to describe this show. After every one of the guests, producer @buckydurddle ran a raffle. Games and books were won by happy members of the audience.

Pausing OperationsDue to the current technical situation, we are unable to review submissions made to Utopian or vote on the contributions scored. Unfortunately, this means we are forced to pause all operations until the Steem blockchain is once again accessible and usable for all community members and moderators.

To stay up-to-date and speak to the Utopian team, we invite you to join the conversation on our Discord server. Witness Server StatusCoinciding with the hardfork is Utopian’s rise to the top 20 list of Steem witnesses. We have been working closely with the other top 20 witnesses throughout the night to make sure the blockchain could resume normal operations. Both main Utopian witness server and backup witnesses have been upgraded to version 0.20.3 and are running properly. We couldn’t be happier to make it into the list of top 20 witnesses, especially at this critical time, and we’ll make sure to publish a dedicated witness update post with all the exciting plans we have for it, as soon as the blockchain returns to normal operations.

Despite the issues with the blockchain we were able to score and pick the winners! But we’re not quite ready to reveal them. Due to the voting power recharge process, we won’t be able to release rewards for the winners just yet. We’ll make sure to publish the list of the winners shortly, and immediately release the liquid prizes. For the post upvotes on the winning submissions, we will ask the winners to publish a comment under their contributions in order for Utopian to give them the upvote value their submission is due.

Investor UpdateUtopian CEO @elear is currently on his second visit to Israel, meeting with potential investors. We’ve learned many lessons from the first visit, and feel even more prepared. We are confident that these meetings will bear fruit, and they’ve been going great. However, investments take time, which leads us into the next prong in our attack: Are you ready for our Indiegogo?One of the main focus points of the Utopian team these past few weeks were our preparations for an Indiegogo campaign. In an aim to sustain and accelerate the development of the Utopian collaboration platform, we’ll be turning to the community as the collective power of the community has always been the engine behind this endeavor. We’re lining up some cool rewards, for contributors and project owners alike, and we are so excited about this. As we prepare to launch the campaign, we’re also making sure to create unique oportunities for you to participate in helping us spread awareness of the Utopian Indiegogo campaign.

Now, as start a branding process of Utopian as a futuristic paradise for open source, it’s time to unveil the market product name of the next stage in our evolution: Utopian Colony. The Colony is our name for the crowdfunding and crowdsourcing reward exchange and content creation platform that we’ve been calling Utopian V2. DevelopmentWe’re are still going strong. Our CTO, @gregory.latinier, is still leading his team in developing Utopian Colony, and things are progressing nicely. Naturally, development will speed up and slow down in accordance to the community’s willingness to be a part of the action, whether as developers or as crowdfunding supporters. Podcasts Are ComingYou may have wondered why have our radio shows have yet to return after the holidays. Well, there’s a reason for that: Both shows are getting a makeover, and both will be available as podcasts. We’ll still have the livestream experience, where you’ll be able to participate in the discussion and be a part of it. But we know that for many people, appointment media is a thing of the past. So we want to make IdeaHub and FOSSHub (formerly the open source radio show) available via your podcatchers. Also, the action will all be taking place in the Utopian discord server. We’ll be simulcasting the show on MSP Waves, but the discussion will be on our own server.

Staff PicksSteem: Account Claims Analysis by @abh12345 [analysis] During the most recent Steem Hardfork, HF20, the Steem blockchain added a feature to help quickly register new users to the ecosystem. This is done by burning Resource Credits (RCs) to create discounted accounts which are later claimed by a user. @abh12345 is one of the finest analysts we have on Utopian and has provided a very detailed and illustrative analysis of account claims on Steem.

With this update we are giving you the opportunity to participate in the creation and distribution of these incentives. Following @utopian.trail upvotesOur beloved Development Community Manager and awesome Pythonist @amosbastian has just released a new bot, working under the account @utopian.trail, that will do the following: Check the reviewed contributions with a score equal or higher than 60/100 across all the categories Give the contributions which qualify an upvote, as soon as possible, with the same voting weight the main @utopian-io account will use @utopian.trail will always vote before the main @utopian-io account does By creating @utopian.trail, Utopian wants to enable more Steem stakeholders to actively participate in the incentives distribution. Utopian holds significant voting power on the Steem blockchain, but that alone will never be enough to scale our support for the open source ecosystem. This is where you come in now. Learn more ways to build open source software via Utopian by creating bounties and tips. Get in touch with us on http://discord.utopian.io Thanks to this simple but effective @utopian.trail bot, you can now follow the @utopian.trail account and manually or automatically upvote high quality Utopian contributions before they are upvoted by the main @utopian-io account. This will assure you excellent curation rewards. Thanks to the way the Steem blockchain operates, every time you upvote a contribution, not only are you contributing to the open source mission, you are also generating curation rewards for yourself. By upvoting before the main @utopian-io account does, you are accessing even more of those. It is important to note that not every contribution with a score equal or higher than 60/100 will be upvoted by @utopian-io. However, we expect the majority of them will. We do this to enable a wider distribution of incentives to deserving contributions. By following the @utopian.trail you can rest assured that your vote will always go to contributions that are of high quality, as well as helping the growth of the Steem blockchain directly and indirectly. How to predict @utopian-io upvotes by following @utopian.trailYou can manually check which contributions are upvoted by @utopian.trail, and have not yet been upvoted, by @utopian-io looking at https://steemd.com/@utopian.trail. You can also use one of the tools to automate your votes: Steemvoter Login or signup on https://beta.steemvoter.com Visit https://beta.steemvoter.com/streams/edit Enter Upvotes in the dropdown “Upvote On” In “Target Account” enter utopian.trail Select the voting power you want to use Steemrewarding Login or signup on https://steemrewarding.com/ Visit https://beta.steemvoter.com/streams/edit Visit https://steemrewarding.com/new_trail_rule Enter utopian.trail in vote to follow (must not be empty!)

More enhancements to the voting behaviourIn order to incentivize as many quality contributions as possible, our main voting bot has been enhanced to: Also consider the age of the contribution in the post, in order to give quality contributions a better chance to get upvoted when they are nearing the payout window. Reduce the voting power reserved for external initiatives, which is going back to Utopian contributions across all categories. Reduce the voting power reserved for the #iamutopian category, which is used by our reviewers and community managers. The voting power reserve will be spread to all contributions in all categories.

We’ve been working towards that for some time, and we’re very excited to tell you all about it! Look for us on Apple podcasts, Stitcher, or any other podcast apps. Look for Utopian Podcasts in podcast name, or for FOSSHub in episode name. https://i.imgur.com/i3VojmZ.png Our schedule, right now, contains 2 episodes per week. Thursdays will have that Monday’s IdeaHub, whereas Saturdays will feature that Wednesday’s FOSSHub. Episodes are likely to arrive fairly late in the day, so don’t worry if you don’t see them first thing in the morning. If you want to add our rss feed manually to your podcatcher, that’s also quite easy. You’ll find us at https://utopian.podbean.com/feed.xml. If you like to listen to episodes on the web, our home is at https://utopian.podbean.com/. There you’ll also find show notes for each episode. Finally, if you want a handy web player for Utopian podcasts, we’ve made a nice little hackmd page for it. We’re very excited about this development. We believe the podcast will help us get greater exposure for open source projects and ideas on and off the Steem blockchain. Our shows are live conversations between open source experts and fans on a variety of topics with valuable insights from guests and audience. Open source is about community. These podcasts aim to give the community a place to speak and listen. About Our Showshttps://i.imgur.com/0uDJbht.png FOSSHub, which has recently started its second season, is our flagship show. Host @jedigeiss, news presenter @techslut, and producer @buckydurdle talk with a variety of developers about their open source projects, and also deliver the open source news. The show airs live every Wednesday at 8PM UTC, and you can find it on Facebook, Youtube, Vimm, and on our discord server, where the conversation is happening in real time. https://i.imgur.com/IVQe0ju.png IdeaHub is our newer show, airing every Monday at 8PM UTC, with the same host and the same producer. Ideas category CM @knowledges is also part of the fun, as folks with new and exciting ideas for open source projects come on to talk about them, and maybe find developers to help them out with them. You’ll find it live everywhere you can find FOSSHub. About Our Host and CrewOur host, @jedigeiss is a developer, a banker, and a Steem veteran. He’s a member of the new steering committee aimed at creating the Steem Alliance foundation that will take over much of the managing of the blockchain from Steemit Inc. Producer @buckydurdle is a veteran producer of both video and audio, and the CM of our Video Tutorials category. He edits the shows, runs the raffles, and makes sure everything works. News presenter and occasional co-host @techslut is Utopian’s CMO. She’s really the boss, but she doesn’t make a big deal of it. She’s a recovering tech journalist and an open source enthusiast.

The goal of the campaign is to raise funds to complete and launch an early version of Utopian Colony in Q2 of this year. The Journey from Home to ColonyOne of the main points of the Utopian presentation at Steemfest 2018 was that Steem is Utopian’s home, and not only because Utopian was transformed from an idea to a business on this blockchain. The Utopian community has grown mainly from the Steem community, allowing Utopian to explore ways to crowdsource open source in ways that would not be possible without this uniquely versatile community. With a vision to empower open source innovation through incentivizing contributions to open source projects, and with the delegated stake invested in Utopian on the blockchain, in a little over a year Utopian has supported over 5,000 contributors who have made over 70,000 contributions to over 9,000 open source repositories. But that’s only the beginning. Operating Utopian on the Steem blockchain for over a year has allowed us to learn many lessons from the contributors and projects who joined Utopian. With the insights gained, we’ve designed and began the development of Utopian Colony - a fully featured collaboration and collective funding platform for all digital professionals. With features like user and project profile pages, task bounty exchange, tipping system, as well as tools for project owners to make better decisions about accepting contributions - Utopian Colony strives to serve all the the needs of the open source community. It is our hope that Utopian Colony will not only bring a mass of new users to the Steem blockchain, but also add value to it. About The Indiegogo CampaignWe’re offering some really cool perks for supporters, including early access, cool profile badges, and some great promotional opportunities for projects and contributors alike. All campaign details are published on our Indiegogo page, and we welcome you to be the first to review it and submit any question you might have about Utopian Colony and the Indiegogo. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI6iil1gMsA Get the word out!Whether you contribute funds to the Utopian Indiegogo Campaign or not, spreading the word and exposing more people to the campaign will help us to reach the campaign goal. We invite you to blog about it, post the campaign on social media, tell your friends and family and anyone who loves open source and wants to support a truly Utopian project. To get the latest updates on the campaign, follow us on Twitter, Facebook and subscribe to the Utopian Colony Newsletter. If you have any questions, comments or ideas for us to implement in making this crowdfunding campaign a record-breaker - please chat to us on the Utopian Discord Server. Utopian was born on Steem, and we believe that the inspiring community on this blockchain will be, as always, incremental to the success of the Utopian company vision.

If we reach the goal, the campaign will attract greater interest and gain attention from bigger media outlets and influencers outside the crypto world. That would give Utopian and other Steem dapps a chance to be better known. Contributing via Fundition will enable you to participate in the campaign if you can’t help Utopian with fiat funds on Indiegogo. We will use the funds raised on Fundition to complete the development of Utopian Colony, as well as boosting the Indiegogo campaign to achieve the greatest exposure we can. What about limited perks?Many of the perks offered via Utopian are limited in number. We will remove perks that has reached the maximum number of purchases combined on Fundition or Indiegogo. 10% beneficiaries will go to FunditionWith this opportunity we wish to support also Fundition, which is enabling so many awesome projects to flourish on the Steem blockchain and beyond. Utopian ColonyUtopian Colony is a platform for open source collaboration, home to all digital professionals with a passion for open source innovation, the culmination of over a year of learning and experimenting, being built on top of the Steem blockchain. By supporting this campaign you can expedite the development of Utopian Colony and help us release it to the public by Q3-2019. We are closer to the release than ever and with your help we can finally turn the Utopian dream into reality. Utopian Colony is fully open source. Check our progress on Github. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI6iil1gMsA Special Perks for SteemiansOn our Fundition and Indiegogo campaigns we have some special offers for contributors and projects, but one of them is only available for Steemians and you can access that now using STEEM via Fundition.

Let’s be honest: without the many open source libraries, plugins, frameworks and apps, the life of developers would be so much harder. Using the awesome work of so many contributors comes easy, contributing further requires more. That’s where I saw a lack: Time, resources and opportunities to grow and expand my open source ideas. I have long struggled to find a solution that would let me dedicate more time to contributing, as well as a place for me to connect more and do more. Open source has been, almost exclusively, an arena for developers. The many benefits, both personal and collective, have only been available to us. I felt there was room for a change: A one-stop-shop for open source collaboration that would empower more digital professionals — developers and beyond — to contribute and reward the awesome work of these innovators. This is where the idea of Utopian came from.It was the usual cold day in Germany, where I was working for an energy company as Javascript consultant. I can clearly remember that typical white light from the German sky burning my tired eyes after hours in front of the computer, when I came across Steem, a social blockchain that grows communities and makes immediate revenue streams possible for users by rewarding them for their work, the perfect place for Utopian to rise.It was Sept. 2017 when I have founded Utopian as a proof-of-concept platform, to explore the needs of projects and contributors in the open source ecosystem. The concept was simple: Create a platform that would enable project owners to connect with a greater variety of digital professionals to finally make open source innovation accessible and inclusive. As soon as the PoC was launched, the response from the community was amazing. Professionals who never contributed to open source projects before started realizing the benefits and the potentials of open collaboration.In a little over a year, Utopian was able to facilitate over 70,000 contributions to over 9,000 repositories and embrace a community of more than 5,000 contributors.One of the many things I have discovered running the proof-of-concept was that content creators, translators, graphic designers and many other digital professionals are eager to connect and collaborate on open source projects. The data was clear, only 7% of the all contributions were code related. There was a huge potential of giving open source innovation in the hands of many more contributors.The journey was full of successes, as well as tough times. One thing was evident, however, Utopian was ready for the next step.On May 2018, with a great team and many lessons learned, we decided to deprecate our proof-of-concept platform and continue to maintain operations with our dedicated users through many partner apps on the Steem blockchain. With a greater vision in mind, and with the knowledge acquired collaborating with dozens of open source projects and professionals, we have started the development of a scalable solution: Utopian Colony.Utopian Colony is the result of a year of learning and experimenting, aimed at solving the needs of open source projects. We have been working tirelessly to bring it to life. Thanks to the efforts of our team, we are ready for the release by Q3–2019 and give early access to our supporters by the end of Q2-2019. Utopian Colony will include a set of key features necessary for project growth and community participation:Personalized Profile &amp; Project PagesBounty Marketplace &amp; Tipping SystemIncentivized Knowledge SharingTools for Collective Financing of Project Development..and so much moreUtopian Colony is fully open source and our development team is working tirelessly to bring it live. With the support of our community and many new Utopians we hope to reach the goal on Indiegogo and Fundition to have the budget we need to finally complete the release.
