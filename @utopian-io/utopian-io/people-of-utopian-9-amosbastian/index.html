            <p><strong>The Community Manager of the Development category on Utopian.io, @amosbastian, loves beer, football, gaming and (obviously) programming. With his vast experience, humble nature and expertise in Python, it&#x2019;s hard to believe how young he is.</strong></p>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cu5eC5v.png" alt="amosbastian"></center>

<p>On Github: https://github.com/amosbastian</p>
<p><strong><em>Who are you, @amosbastian?</em></strong></p>
<p>I&#x2019;m a 24 year old computer science student, half English (born there) and half Dutch (lived there the majority of my life), currently living in Lisbon. I&#x2019;m really interested in programming (which is quite obvious), football (Glory Glory Man United!), gaming (1v1 me) and, if I can be bothered, lifting weights. </p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t think I have any special talents; I can&#x2019;t play any musical instruments and it&#x2019;s a wonder I can speak more than one language (English and Dutch). I guess I do have a lot of knowledge about beer, if that counts for anything.</p>
<p>One may say I&#x2019;m a pretty open guy who enjoys meeting new people, talking to them and joking around. I&#x2019;ve had people tell me that I am one of the most laid back people they have ever met (maybe it&#x2019;s just my laziness), which I tend to sort of agree with since it&#x2019;s pretty hard to phase me. </p>
<p>However, since I&#x2019;m half Dutch (maybe it&#x2019;s just an excuse), I&#x2019;m quite straight-forward or &#x201C;blunt&#x201D;. I dislike people who beat around the bush without getting to a point. Also, despite my laid-back nature, if I disagree with something I will make sure to let you know, and can get quite passionate when that&#x2019;s the case (sorry!).</p>

<p><strong><em>How long have you been involved in Open Source projects?</em></strong></p>
<p>I actually wasn&#x2019;t really involved in open source projects before joining Utopian. I was mainly busy with stuff on Reddit, though I have created some things for the post-match thread team on /r/leagueoflegends, and a bot for /r/fantasypl. They were all kept closed source - the main reason being my embarrassment at my admittedly shitty code. Looking back at it now I wish I was a bit more confident and had gotten involved in open source projects years ago. It&#x2019;s a great way to improve your programming skills while meeting cool people, so I would definitely urge people who feel the same as I did to just say &#x201C;fuck it&#x201D; and take that leap.</p>
<p><strong><em>Do you own / manage one or more projects of your own?</em></strong></p>
<p>Currently I have a few projects that I have been maintaining, as you can see on my GitHub profile, and have a few plans for projects I want to further improve or create over the next few months. I&#x2019;m really excited about them, but will keep them under wraps for now.</p>
<p><strong><em>What does your professional skill-set offer the Open Source community and what type of contributions do you normally make?</em></strong></p>
<p>I actually started on Utopian.io by contributing mostly tutorials (collaborating with a friend on the account @steempytutorials). At the time, I was learning how to use steem-python, so I thought it would be a great way to help people solve the problems I was encountering myself. </p>
<p>I feel I was burnt out writing tutorials and also came to the conclusion that I really wanted to focus on myself more and get additional experience actually developing stuff. So nowadays I mostly submit contributions to the development category, but sometimes I also report bugs to the bug hunting category.</p>
<p><strong><em>Which programming languages / platforms do you feel most at home with?</em></strong></p>
<p>As you may have guessed, I am most comfortable programming with Python - I use it daily and it has pretty much become my bread and butter. I&#x2019;m still far from satisfied with my skill level, so I will soon be buying a physical copy (I hate reading PDFs off a screen) of Fluent Python, as I&#x2019;ve heard great things about it. I have also been busy with learning some more JavaScript and a bit of Vue.js, as I really want to be able to help out Utopian internally (and also some of my aforementioned planned projects require this as well).</p>
<p><strong><em>How did you discover Utopian, and how do you think Utopian affects your relationships with the Open Source community and ecosystem?</em></strong></p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve always been interested in helping others by either showing them how to do or create something. When I saw that you could get rewarded for doing exactly that by contributing to Utopian I thought that was really cool. So I joined.</p>
<p>I am, without a doubt, more involved in the open source community than I was before I found Utopian, which makes me feel really grateful. It has really incentivised my thirst for learning new things. Previously, I used to spend a lot of my time playing League of Legends, but now I mostly spend it on actively learning about new things (by either reading, programming, discussing etc.), so I definitely don&#x2019;t feel like I&#x2019;m wasting my time as much as I was before. Obviously this also feels very rewarding, especially when it makes me feel like my personal growth isn&#x2019;t stagnating and that my time is spent on more valuable things. So yeah, I would definitely say it has affected my relationship with the open source community in a very positive way: I&#x2019;m more involved, learning a lot, which in turn means I can contribute more value - it&#x2019;s amazing!</p>
<p>Utopian.io also changed the way I see the impact of the open source movement. As I mentioned earlier, I didn&#x2019;t want to share my code when people asked, mostly because I was embarrassed at its quality. I also didn&#x2019;t really understand why they wanted me to share it. Now my mindset is completely different and I feel like I really do understand why code should be shared. This makes me feel very passionate about open source in general, but also regretful I didn&#x2019;t come to this conclusion sooner. Well, let&#x2019;s just say I&#x2019;m more than happy I found Utopian.io and made it part of my life.</p>

<p><strong><em>What made you decide to take on additional roles in the organization itself?</em></strong></p>
<p>When I first started contributing I just had this overwhelming sense of excitement and inspiration. After everything sank in and I realised how great Utopian&#x2019;s vision actually, was I applied to be a moderator pretty much straight away, as I knew I needed to be a part of it. </p>
<p>I was initially rejected by @mkt because his team was full (&#x1F62D;), so after two weeks of bugging @jestemkioskiem I finally got my foot in the door and was allowed in as a tutorial moderator. I actually still vividly remember my first day moderating as back then contributions could be any language and a large part of tutorials were really below par. I spent most of my time busting plagiarists and rejecting low quality contributions. This became some kind of routine for me (also tag teaming contributions with @roj) and I guess I sort of built up a reputation as a &#x201C;strict&#x201D; moderator, as I took quality over quantity quite seriously. </p>
<p>During a weekly management meeting @elear mentioned that there might be a need for a new supervisor (as they were then called). Out of nowhere, @espoem suggested it should be me, which came as a very pleasant surprise. I was asked if I would be interested, and of course I answered yes - to me it seemed like a great opportunity to get myself in a position where I could have some more influence within Utopian and try to help guide it in the &#x201C;right&#x201D; direction, in my own way. </p>
<p>A few weeks passed and it wasn&#x2019;t really mentioned again until @mkt announced he was stepping down. After having a voice call with him (where we mostly talked about recreational activities :^)) I found myself in the position of development supervisor/community manager - a position I have latched onto ever since.</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you see the future of Utopian? What would you want it to be, and where would you like to see yourself in it?</em></strong></p>
<p>I really think the future of Utopian.io is bright, especially when I consider all the amazing people that are already involved in the organization. It would be really great if it could break through to a broader audience, though, as I&#x2019;d love to see every open source contributor receiving some kind of support from us. There&#x2019;s definitely a long road ahead, but I&#x2019;m sure we can do it. I&#x2019;m bad at expressing my feelings properly (unless beer is involved) so bear with me - I&#x2019;m trying my best to get across how excited I am about its potential!</p>
<p>Where I see myself in the future&#x2026; at THE TOP after having ousted @elear! Just joking! As I mentioned earlier I want to work hard on improving my programming skills so I can help more on that front, but other than that I have no idea - I&#x2019;ll just go with the flow and see where this crazy ride takes me!</p>
<p><strong><em>What is your favorite thing about Utopian?</em></strong></p>
<p>This is a really difficult question as there are so many different things. I would say that it&#x2019;s really amazing that people can get rewarded for contributing to open source projects, which has some kind of benefit to at least someone - I think that&#x2019;s a great goal. Also, all the cool people involved! There are all kinds of people from different countries that all bring something unique, be it their personalities, skills or knowledge. I just love meeting new people and we definitely already have a great bunch. Huge shout-out to the development moderators in particular - you guys are the best!</p>
<p><strong><em>Was it Steem first and Utopian second for you, or did you discover Utopian before steem?</em></strong></p>
<p>Actually, the person (@juliank) who I collaborated with on @steempytutorials is also the person who brought me onto the Steem blockchain. We know each other from university and one day, out of nowhere, he asked me if I wanted to help him out with a project he had planned. During the call where he was explaining what the Steem blockchain actually is, he showed me some projects he thought were cool - including Utopian.io, of course. </p>
<p>I guess I &#x201C;discovered&#x201D; both sort of simultaneously, and so I started contributing to Utopian pretty soon after actually joining Steemit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Are there any particular projects on Utopian you&#x2019;re a fan of?</em></strong></p>
<p>There are quite a few projects that I&#x2019;m a fan of, actually. They are also made by some of my favourite developers on Utopian:</p>
<p>@miniature-tiger&#x2019;s Archipelago game has been improving with each contribution, and he&#x2019;s really a great example of someone who always submits quality contributions!</p>
<p>@sambillingham is also great. He is constantly churning out amazing projects, but if you only have time to check out one I would definitely recommend checking out his Finally Comments project!</p>
<p>Our very own @emrebeyler always has cool projects as well, and is definitely a source of inspiration for me!</p>
<p>@mkt&#x2019;s The Magic Frog (@the-magic-frog) is such a great idea and really a lot of fun - go participate if you haven&#x2019;t already!</p>
<p>There are so many more great projects on Utopian, so I can&#x2019;t mention all of them (sorry!). I really look forward to seeing what kind of projects the future holds for us all.</p>
<p><strong><em>Steem is the home for many apps aside from Utopian. Which are your favorite and why?</em></strong></p>
<p>Admittedly I don&#x2019;t really keep up with the Steem world outside of Utopian as much as I should, so I don&#x2019;t actually know. Steem Monsters seems like a pretty cool idea, but other than that I can&#x2019;t think of any.</p>
<p><strong><em>What other Steem communities / initiatives are you part of? Any you would like to create?</em></strong></p>
<p>I wouldn&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;m really involved with other communities, but I&#x2019;m mostly (outside of programming) interested in football, so I always participate in predictions and similar things to that. Especially fantasy football is something I&#x2019;m very interested in! Actually, the first thing I did when I joined Steem was looking for something related to the Fantasy Premier League and found out that @acidyo was hosting a league - I even wrote some articles about it back then with hints and tips, which I might start doing again in the future&#x2026; maybe.</p>
