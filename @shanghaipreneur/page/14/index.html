        <div class="content">
            <p>Well, a couple days ago, I posted my thoughts on where the crypto markets were headed and where we needed to pay attention to the charts.</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@shanghaipreneur/cryptocurrency-global-market-cap-technical-analysis-with-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@shanghaipreneur/cryptocurrency-global-market-cap-technical-analysis-with-charts</a></p>
<p>Of course, the shellacking put on all cryptos on February 2 has forced me to reevaluate where I think the markets will find support. Hence, I present to you my updated global crypto markets support line!</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmTP9GQZK1V1HW1QAzPB8wtdkMPVrCMByT32iTeUi6HRdV/Global%20Charts%202.3.png" alt="Global Charts 2.3.png"></p>
<p>As I posted yesterday during the crash, it looks to me like $8200/BTC and the $390 B market cap line are critical levels of support. Although we dipped significantly below the $390 B line yesterday (CMC shows a low of $348 B at 8:47 UTC), we only spent at total of 3 hours trading below that critical $390 B line.</p>
<p>On February 3, markets again tested the $390 B line and, so far, have held. At the time I&#x2019;m writing this, the global market cap for cryptos stands at about $414 billion. So it looks like we are getting some breathing room.</p>
<p>For myself, I&#x2019;ll go back to managing my investments, planning my classes, and caring for my daughter&#x2026; But I definitely am gonna set an alert for the next time the market cap gets around $390 B!</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

            <p>With all the pessimism and let&#x2019;s call it &#x201C;Toyotaism&#x201D; (as opposed to Lamboism) in the cryptoworld these days, I thought I might like to think positively for a bit this morning. If I am trying to think like Warren Buffett, I might console myself with the old Rothschild quote to only &#x201C;buy when there&#x2019;s blood in the streets.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmPpET1tQ8n6duyd85aEu1o3p3TTUYjUipt5sdJqfCVreN/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Buffett, however, in his old folksy way toned that down a bit. His famous quote for days like today is be  &#x201C;fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.&#x201D;</p>
<p>No mention of blood at all.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmNr7cDwp1gv6MH7UBDyiQWWLy2fsFLvmTmdaEDykLingu/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>So how we might be able to think like Buffett in the crypto markets?</p>
<p>The goal is to look around for the fallen angels of a month ago and see where there might be some bargains lying about. Today I want to highlight one of these &#x201C;pearls&#x201D; of the cryptoverse and talk about Oyster (PRL) token.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmbQVgcFa3tkWug6X4CJAspZ99QZD451fQcjrtP1Zy5dej/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It goes without saying that I am obviously not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice and don&#x2019;t listen to me because I only looked up this coin initially because my daughter&#x2019;s name is Pearl and then I read the whitepaper and I thought it was kinda neat and you should always invest your own money while considering your own unique circumstances etc. I have a very little amount of money in this investment so you shouldn&#x2019;t listen to me anyway. This is not financial advice. Investments carry risk. At the very least, please just go and skim the whitepaper!</p>
<p>Here: <a href="https://oyster.ws/OysterWhitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://oyster.ws/OysterWhitepaper.pdf</a></p>
<p>Okay. Done.</p>
<p>Oyster (PRL), formerly Oyster Pearl, is an interesting project that melds together a rather elegant solution for two of the more interesting and achievable early crypto use cases.</p>
<p>The first crypto use case involves decentralized storage. Other projects in this space that you might know are Sic (SC), Filecoin (FIL), and Storj (STORJ). With the exponential growth in data and also the growth of the companies that generate, manage, analyze, and interpret our data - the FAANG/BAT internet &#x201C;barons&#x201D; of the modern era - ways to decentralize and reduce the cost burden of data for megacap companies, not to mention just regular everyday Joes like me, are going to be the foundation of a few quite valuable companies. For comparison, Dropbox and Box are the centralized competitors in this space. Dropbox is currently estimated to be worth about $10 billion. Box trades on the stock market as BOX. It is currently valued at around $3 billion.</p>
<p>The second crypto use case for PRL involves disrupting the entire media monetization industry. The debate goes back at least as far as media has been a thing. There is a constant battle between content creator and content distributor. In this traditional scenario, the centralizing force in the economy is the distributor. In the blues era, artists literally sold their rights for a song. They would get paid for the performance, but the capitalist behind the recording desk would own the rights to that song and the recording. Later, agents would come along to &#x201C;save&#x201D; the artists. But that&#x2019;s just a less-powerful centralizing force (the agents) doing battle with a more powerful centralizing force (the labels). With the digitization of music, the industry became more decentralized. But we still have the Apple Music Store, so there is still quite a bit of power left in this system to the distributor at the expense of the creator.</p>
<p>But that is all about to change. The rising costs of live sports media to wholesale entertainment distributors like Disney shows the potential for what happens wise up to the value of the content they create.</p>
<p>They get paid. When the NBA renegotiated its media rights deals with Turner, ESPN, Tencent and others, value of the teams skyrocketed! The Houston Rockets, whose best player is set to start a $50 million a year contract, were not coincidentally just sold for more than $2.2 BILLION.</p>
<p>Media is by its very nature traditionally a highly centralized industry. They make money by being the gateway through which you consume your media. But they don&#x2019;t make any media. Not really. The content creators (the artists) themselves do.</p>
<p>Previously, independent content creators were not powerful enough to confront entrench centralized media forces. But with technology like the Oyster Protocol, they have a fighting chance to have their, at first, tiny voice heard and get compensated fairly by those that hear it and appreciate it.</p>
<p>Other projects on the more ambitious, and rather broad, side of this space are the Basic Attention Token (BAT), Kin (KIN), and our beloved STEEM. I&#x2019;m sure there are others.</p>
<p>More specific to the advertising media industry, where projects are essentially trying to &#x201C;blockchain-ify&#x201D; the existing agent business model, are AdEx (ADX) and Chinapex (CPX).</p>
<p>A couple of blockchain projects that disrupt the media monetization industry are gonna be ridiculously valuable. And, hey! It maybe could end up being Oyster (PRL).</p>
<p>So what got my attention from a chart perspective in the past day of &#x201C;blood in the street&#x201D; crypto pricing? Well, check out my highly advanced technical analysis below!</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmVtwdGC7BNEXKBLRym96Ywa2rtV9zQZ1PcPaLEnF3cso7/oyster%20pearl%20feb%202.jpg" alt="oyster pearl feb 2.jpg"></p>
<p>From 7,516 to 14,078 satoshis in BTC is a really serious high-volume move in a way-way-down market. When the entire global market cap for cryptos starts to creep back up, this pearl of the cryptoverse could generate a little alpha for risk-tolerant crypto investors.</p>
<p>What do you think about Oyster (PRL) as a potential cryptoasset investment?</p>

            <p>Big news on what is becoming the &#x201C;new normal&#x201D; in the crypto markets today - low volume down days. Hey, it happens to all the markets at some point. It&#x2019;s a normal part of a consolidation phase. Consolidation patterns look like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://media.dailyfx.com/illustrations/2012/04/27/Two_Proven_Ways_to_Trade_a_Consolidation_Zone_body_Two_Proven_Ways_4_25.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So I&#x2019;m still not worried about the cryps. Plus, there&#x2019;s exciting news today that could be potentially profitable!</p>
<p>RaiBlocks - the crypto you never really knew what exactly it was about&#x2026; Did they just forget to put an L in the name? Is it like a railroad blockchain project? Does XRB have anything to do with being exorbitant? &#x2026; Well they have now rebranded to NANO, according to an announcement posted on their Medium page: <a href="https://medium.com/@nanocurrency/nano-rebrand-announcement-9101528a7b76" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://medium.com/@nanocurrency/nano-rebrand-announcement-9101528a7b76</a></p>
<p>And you might be thinking, &#x201C;Wait a minute, didn&#x2019;t some other coin do a rebrand and make a bunch of gains afterwards?&#x201D; And you&#x2019;d be right. You&#x2019;d be thinking of NEO, which concluded its rebrand from AntShares on, of course, 8-8-17. The significance there being that NEO is THE China coin and Chinese people are just obsessed with 8s. I mean, they even arranged to host the Summer Olympics just so they could start the ceremony exactly at 8:08 pm on 8-8-08. It&#x2019;s true.</p>
<p>So how did NEO do since the rebrand? Oh, I&#x2019;d say not bad.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmVq7cNAVTyx6n22jWi8VXyxQFeroi6UrTZP5LvcFa4BFE/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At its high of near $200 per coin, NEO returned nearly 10x since its rebrand. At today&#x2019;s prices of around $130 per coin, that&#x2019;s still a healthy six-bagger IN LESS THAN HALF A YEAR.</p>
<p>Could a similar ramp-up be in store for RailBocks, um, I mean NANO?</p>

            <p>Call me an old fashioned stock investor but I sometimes gotta remind all my whippersnapper crypto guys to step back and take a bit of a look from the long-term perspective. Sure, crypto markets right now are &#x201C;boring&#x201D;&#x2026; But that&#x2019;s actually great! More on that later&#x2026; But come on, what&#x2019;s &#x201C;boring&#x201D; about a market where most investors are up 3x-4x in the manner of a couple of months?</p>
<p>There are some obvious and unavoidable calendar reasons for this recent &#x201C;boring&#x201D; crypto market. But let&#x2019;s take a look in this post at just the technical side of analyzing price movements.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmSAf7u8CV8JRxHNfsTp9Suw2SxoMivTvrNCbVxjgv8d5K/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here we have a screenshot from our favorite CMC screen - the total market cap of the global crypto market. Not bad! We&#x2019;re almost triple from where we were 3 months ago. Yeah, we were at one brief point more than quadruple up in the past 3 months. But dems da breaks. It&#x2019;s like that.</p>
<p>But I&#x2019;m really not worried. And I&#x2019;ll show you why in this next image:</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmcjEsxps3P2GNA9Sfa339f9WtGnHczSNLyu8EVzaAnNsA/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here we have a long-term support line for the global crypto markets. As long as we are bobbing along this line, with continually slightly higher lows at low volume, when trading volume does reappear on the crypto markets, most likely after the conclusion of Lunar New Year festivities in East Asia - coincidentally home to most of the world&#x2019;s crypto trading volume - we are likely to see a positive impact on the global crypto market cap</p>

<p>Amazon is an e-commerce behemoth, a sprawling media empire, an airport, soon a luxury grocery store&#x2026; No wonder Jeff Bezos was officially the richest man in the world for maybe 24 hours. Though he is now an unceremonious #2, he still gets President Trump fired up. Maybe the Great Coiffed One does not threaten the &#x201C;fury&#x201D; like he does with No. 3 Fat over in the Hermit Kingdom, but Trump does on occasion get himself in a tizzy over the &#x201C;Amazon Washington Post.&#x201D; And though, yes, Bezos&#x2019; company has nothing technically to do with Bezos&#x2019; newspaper, it&#x2019;s probably time that we officially begin the watch for this administration&#x2019;s high-profile anti-trust investigation into the purveyors of Prime entertainment and online products.</p>
<p>Remember the last time this happened? The United States v. Microsoft Corp. basically forced the company run by the world&#x2019;s then-richest man to stand still for a decade. On the day the settlement was proposed on Nov 2. 2001, MSFT traded at $27 per share. When the settlement decree finally expired, unenforced, it traded at $25. During Microsoft&#x2019;s lost decade, the company missed out on massive opportunities in search, e-commerce, smart phones and social media. Would Bill Gates&#x2019; company have acted differently without the specter of anti-trust action perpetually hanging over it?</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmWLP71wHS4x2x1XTGDSmjWAsJ3itMNJmS5pcydyUMxh5S/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Absolutely. Michael Cusumano, a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management in 2011, told the Seattle Times, &#x201C;Since the antitrust suit, they have become much more cautious and much less aggressive&#x2026; They&#x2019;re afraid, it seems. Whether it&#x2019;s antitrust in U.S. or in Europe, they seem to be slowly reacting to the world around them, rather than trying to get in there fast.&#x201D;</p>
<p>During the period dominated by potential anti-trust legislation, Gates would broker a deal to save Apple. From a purely business standpoint, this move made no sense. But taking into account the anti-trust concerns, Gates felt compelled to make a $150 million investment in Apple preferred shares. The cash infusion would save Apple from bankruptcy and preserve a viable competitor to Microsoft. Apple then went on to reinvent the music and cellphone industries. Microsoft stuck to its knitting, selling operating systems and office software and not much else. What else could it do?</p>
<p>If Amazon faced anti-trust action, would they be able to continue their aggressive expansion into nearly every sector of the US economy? Could they do much more than Microsoft did?</p>
<p>There is no love lost between Donald Trump and Jeff Bezos. Campaign Trump warned us that Amazon has &#x201C;a huge antitrust problem.&#x201D; Is it possible that a new attorney general to replace the neutered Jeff Sessions would be encouraged to go after Bezos&#x2019; pride and joy? Could Trump just wake up one morning and feel like doing it and do it?</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmNf2wuteKKbiYYztAV97n53iikjaTbd1kk2ks7ivueo35/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The first step may occur when Democrats in the Senate bluster over Amazonopoly&#x2019;s proposed Whole Foods acquisition. U.S. Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) penned a letter to the House Judiciary Committee requesting hearings on Amazon&#x2019;s Whole Foods acquisition. He claims that the deal is another in a long line of mergers that have &#x201C;decreased wages and resulted in gross inequality in the workplace.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Amazon&#x2019;s proposed acquisition of Whole Foods raises important questions concerning competition policy, such as how the transaction will affect the future of retail grocery stores, whether platform dominance impedes innovation, and if the antitrust laws are working effectively to ensure economic opportunity, choice and low prices for American families,&#x201D; Cicilline wrote.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmf1rgxhFfqcEdjd9BtvfXzvWjyXqNnPehmE4EXEYxmQVJ/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Another arrow in the anti-trust quiver is Amazon&#x2019;s appetite for airports. In January, Amazon announced a $1.5 billion investment in Northern Kentucky to develop its own air cargo hub. The lease is for acreage nearly one-and-a-half times FedEx&#x2019;s headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee. There are also rumors that Amazon may buy an airport in Germany. Wait&#x2026; so Amazon is trying to put how many companies out of business?</p>
<p>At some point, government regulators have to ask, &#x201C;How is having all of these disparate assets under one corporate umbrella not violate some or all of the extant anti-trust statutes?&#x201D;</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m not a lawyer. But I can read the legal writing on the wall. Amazonopoly is happening right before our eyes. Eventually, some lawmaker or regulator is going to want to make a name for themselves by going after the richest guy in the world and his leviathan company.</p>
<p>It is here that Amazon&#x2019;s strategy will backfire. As opposed to the rising Asian internet super-conglomerates like Alibaba, Softbank, and Tencent, which emphasize complex cross-ownership structures in their capital accumulation, AMZN prefers to wholly own and operate all of its various operations and subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Not exactly a good argument when you&#x2019;re trying to prove you&#x2019;re NOT an Amazonopoly.</p>
