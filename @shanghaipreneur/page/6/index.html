            <p>It&#x2019;s not been a very good few days in Cryptoland. Bitcoin is down. Ethereum is lower than I&#x2019;ve ever seen it, except for that time my buddy told me to look into it back when it was trading at $11.</p>
<p>You know that guy. He didn&#x2019;t buy it either, but somehow he knew about it in early 2016. Somehow.</p>
<p>Maybe we&#x2019;ll get that chance again, buddy!</p>
<p>Dark days indeed.<br>#<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmP7v2BnEKN7T23QkCWZvnuHXC52XdSgAgYDvp1nSj7FN2/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>YouTube cryptocurrency advocates are jumping off the figurative bridge like lemmings and &#x201C;blockchain enthusiasts&#x201D; all over the world are, at best, crying in their beer.</p>
<p>A lot of them are taking the label &#x201C;blockchain enthusiast&#x201D; off of their LinkedIn profile. Maybe even for good. This classic meme has lost a couple of its job descriptors. How sad!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmRF253mXTP87ejya6xGiJwk4dpMK6Mo5w5KJpTrHyhkiZ/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But the wind keeps blowing. As it tends to do, the water keeps flowing down to the sea.</p>
<p>People are still investing in blockchain. Yesterday, one huge $16 million investment was made by the big boys, Fenbushi Capital, Michael Novogratz, Block.one, OKcoin, et al., in a blockchain gaming startup named <a href="https://mythical.games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mythical Games</a>. The venture was founded by an impressive array of gaming executives with roots at Activision, Blizzard, and Yahoo.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s cool stuff. Check it out.</p>

<h1 id="So-where-do-I-think-this-market-is-headed-from-here"><a href="#So-where-do-I-think-this-market-is-headed-from-here" class="headerlink" title="So where do I think this market is headed from here?"></a>So where do I think this market is headed from here?</h1><p>I honestly don&#x2019;t know. For months, I held to the glimmer of hope that we would not go below the old Bitcoin Cash FUD low from around this time last year.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNp44ZrFdjWaCF9WCURjwPZyaLpLhJM4MQDmbhUTR4MTh/IMG_1541.jpg" alt="IMG_1541.jpg"></p>
<p>Yeah, that was from back when the last time old Faketoshi got a stick up his butt and started getting angry about god knows what. Boy, was I wrong!</p>
<p>So in reality, I think that this downward spiral is not fully over. But I would say that prices are just beginning to look reasonable around here.</p>
<p>Finally.</p>
<p>I am definitely enjoying the cheap STEEM. We&#x2019;ll see if I pick up anything else in the near future.</p>
<p>Every day that we have a reasonable industry is another day where we rid ourselves of the scammers &amp; fraudsters that ruined this fledgling young industry throughout the past year.</p>
<p>Like Nietzsche said, &#x201C;Whatever doesn&#x2019;t kill us makes us stronger.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Those are the only words of comfort I can think of right now. And I think cases like this <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/grifter-journalist-jerry-ji-guo-jailed-for-alleged-bitcoin-long-con" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pressICO one</a> that I read about today are exactly what he meant.</p>
<p>Oh, just looking at <a href="https://www.pressico.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this website</a> for their ICO makes me mad. It&#x2019;s so easy to scam people with slick graphics and a litany of empty promises.</p>
<h1 id="Agggghhhhh"><a href="#Agggghhhhh" class="headerlink" title="Agggghhhhh!"></a>Agggghhhhh!</h1><p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmR9YkPE3of7PF3y7Uj2XFf3LM3rrNqdDUer1UfmKbCC3V/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So good riddance to this Jerry Ji Guo guy. Have fun rotting in a federal prison. I look forward to hearing more stories like this one in the coming months.</p>
<p>But that&#x2019;s one less scammer/fraudster hype man piece of trash that will distract us from the long-term goal of using blockchain to make the world a better, more equitable, and transparent place. My heart goes out to David Ritter and my friends at <a href="https://www.penta.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Penta</a> for getting duped by this scum.</p>
<p>But hey, it happens.</p>
<p>And when it does, there&#x2019;s only one thing left to do:</p>
<p>Keep BUIDL-ing your startup!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>The fast-moving nature of blockchain and blockchain-related events is that sometimes opportunity comes when you least expect it. The only thing I can say is:</p>
<p>Be ready.</p>
<p>So it was when I was asked a couple days before a Shanghai fintech event held at the posh Ritz-Carlton Hotel in the Lujiazui financial district of Pudong by <a href="https://www.profit-loss.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Profit &amp; Loss</a>, a London-based monthly business magazine that covers the FX (foreign exchange) currency and derivative markets. Blockchain and cryptocurrency is an admittedly very small part of this universe, but P&amp;L is visionary enough to realize that the sector is certain to be part of the way forward. They even have a new magazine targeted toward institutional investors specifically for blockchain assets. It&#x2019;s called <a href="https://ontheblock.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On The Block</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmWak5vz4ioWiQg5X33eG91Utzjgt5jtMumn5rmGeb2iEW/IMG_0618%20steempost.jpg" alt="IMG_0618 steempost.jpg"></p>
<p>Such was the scenario in the precious few hours I had to spare to prepare for the fintech panel I was to be on at the Profit &amp; Loss conference. I used that time to gather my thoughts about the current state of these edge markets. It was an interesting experience and I thought, &#x201C;Hey, why not share my thoughts here in a series of posts?&#x201D; So here you go.</p>
<h1 id="Question-1-Everyone-always-talks-about-fintech-&#x201C;disrupting&#x201D;-financial-markets-Is-it-really-that-disruptive-of-a-force-Will-fintech-companies-prove-to-be-competitors-or-partners-to-financial-services-firms"><a href="#Question-1-Everyone-always-talks-about-fintech-&#x201C;disrupting&#x201D;-financial-markets-Is-it-really-that-disruptive-of-a-force-Will-fintech-companies-prove-to-be-competitors-or-partners-to-financial-services-firms" class="headerlink" title="Question 1: Everyone always talks about fintech &#x201C;disrupting&#x201D; financial markets. Is it really that disruptive of a force? Will fintech companies prove to be competitors or partners to financial services firms?"></a>Question 1: Everyone always talks about fintech &#x201C;disrupting&#x201D; financial markets. Is it really that disruptive of a force? Will fintech companies prove to be competitors or partners to financial services firms?</h1><p>#<br>As usual, complex phenomena are never really well characterized in black-and-white.  Similarly, fintech firms should be arrayed along a spectrum between disruptor and partner, not as either one or the other. Over time, even that essential nature is destined to fluctuate over time.</p>
<p>Visa has got to be THE example of OG fintech. Fintech before it was so cool to shorten those seven hard-to-pronounce syllables (&#x201C;financial technology&#x201D;) down into the two that we know and love so much today.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVqnPVVne5YMxuQNpKzZafirHBGixDgFjqDtUs1SxZ8hv/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Bank of America started Visa in 1958. They called it BankAmericard. Ironically, the innovative concept was born via a concept that should be very familiar to the connoisseur of blockchain assets. Yep, the Visa phenomenon began when Bank of America &#x201C;airdropped&#x201D; 2 million credit cards on the state of California in 1958. They lost over $20 million in the endeavor. The pioneers that thought up the whole project were fired. But, in the end, the company had proven the viability of an all-purpose revolving credit card account. Today, the publicly listed company that became Visa Inc. (V) is now worth more than $300 billion.</p>
<p>Thus, the core motivation for fintech has been, and always will be, disruption. But, technically, that disruption can come from within the very establishments that need to be disrupted. So, the role of a fintech company is destined to vacillate between disruptive competitor and partner. The key, simply, is to create an environment where the five competitive forces, as theorized by Harvard professor Michael Porter, can be unleashed upon, and sustainably exist within, the market.</p>
<p>To return to the example of Visa, it started as a disruptor of its own company. So much so that Bank of America had to move the company out of its control in 1970. Shhhhhh! &#x1F92B;Don&#x2019;t tell any long-term BAC stockholders they could have had an extra $300 billion asset that would basically double the value of their stock.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmayz9L2mcymejzytYBWSmFJk5AXMi4an3T2rtEp1qVHnD/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Under private ownership of a collection of international banks, Visa settled in for decades as an indispensable intermediary for the traditional financial services industry. From disruptor to partner in about 15 years. Time moves a little faster these days, of course. Thanks to the exponential nature of technology&#x2019;s S-curve.</p>
<p>Square is a perfect example of a &#x201C;fintech disruptor&#x201D; these days. The &#x201C;other company&#x201D; founded by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is now worth 20% more than the microtexting platform that made him famous. Square is a bleeding-edge US fintech company that is &#x201C;revolutionizing&#x201D; (this is the vocabulary of fintech disruptors!) the small business payment services, accounting, and business analytics industry. And, oh yeah, it has a Cash app that has more users than Paypal and lets you buy Bitcoin. And guess what? Visa owns 10% of it.</p>
<p>Disruptor, yeah. But also, eventually, partner. That&#x2019;s the nature of the relationship between new fintech and traditional finance. Like yin and yang, they both need each other to evolve and succeed.</p>

            <p>The power of blockchain is often characterized as one that enables two parties to engage in &#x201C;trustless&#x201D; transactions. Lately, I&#x2019;ve been thinking a lot about what exactly that means. I mean, upon further consideration, the word &#x201C;trustless&#x201D; seems like a bad word.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s check the tape then. What&#x2019;s the actual definition of &#x201C;trustless&#x201D;? I went to the dictionary and checked it out.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/trustless" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dictionary.com</a>, the word &#x201C;trustless&#x201D; means &#x201C;untrustworthy, deceitful; distrusting, wary, suspicious.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Uh, that&#x2019;s supposed to make me feel better about blockchain?</p>
<p>We, as an industry, need to rethink this.</p>
<p>I started thinking about this obvious conundrum a couple weeks ago when I saw notorious uber Bitcoin maximalist Bobby Lee give a highly entertaining speech in Shanghai. I then came across this strange feeling that something is just amiss about the way we talk about this topic in general once again while researching the 4th episode in our <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-535980100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Block Runners</a> podcast series about &#x201C;Proof of Work&#x201D; (coming out soon!).</p>
<p>We need to wrap our heads around this concept of &#x201C;trustlessness&#x201D; because it lays at the very foundation of why blockchain technology is revolutionary. As <em>The Economist</em> put it in an <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2015/10/31/the-trust-machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> on the 7th anniversary of Satoshi Nakomoto&#x2019;s whitepaper in 2015, it is this aspect which &#x201C;makes possible a currency without a central bank.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmfYhrZCYPNgwxV8apSTYnDqqTBUNq5zgPkvNjUyMvKXGi/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Thankfully, I&#x2019;m not the first person to call out the misnomer that using the word &#x201C;trustless&#x201D; in reference to a blockchain is. For that, I look to the wonderful <a href="https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Preethi Kasireddy</a>. Her February 5 Medium article on the subject, &#x201C;ELI5: What do we mean by &#x2018;blockchains are trustless&#x2019;?&#x201D; is a <a href="https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/eli5-what-do-we-mean-by-blockchains-are-trustless-aa420635d5f6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great resource</a>.</p>
<p>A truly &#x201C;trustless&#x201D; transaction can only occur when the two parties engaging in the transaction are in physical proximity to one another. All other non-present transactions require some form of intermediary to replace the trust that can only be earned by actually looking someone in the eye and shaking their hand while you are engaging in an exchange of value.</p>
<p>However, this setup is clearly limited and in no way facilitates the scaling of a global payment network. So how exactly does blockchain help to revolutionize the transfer of value instantaneously and globally? Is this conceit a myth? Not really. We&#x2019;re just using the wrong words to talk about what is going on here.</p>
<p>To quote Ms. Kasireddy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a &#x201C;centralized&#x201D; system, we trust a single third party (e.g. Chase Bank) to act as the intermediary who guarantees those two properties [sender authenticity &amp; currency validity] ; in a &#x201C;decentralized&#x201D; system, our trust is placed elsewhere, namely in public-key cryptography and a &#x201C;consensus mechanism&#x201D; that allows us to determine the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, instead of trusting in a centralized party, when we conduct a transaction on a public blockchain, we are placing our trust in an entire ecosystem of <strong>distributed trust</strong>.</p>
<p>Or as Kasireddy puts it, using a public blockchain means that we are &#x201C;trusting everyone in aggregate.&#x201D; All of the developers, miners, and users of that blockchain that have ever existed up to that point in the distributed ledger.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s kind of like jumping into a swimming pool full of warm water, whereas dealing with a bank is like jumping into a potentially ice cold bath full of hammerhead and Great White sharks.</p>
<p>You tell me which one you&#x2019;d prefer.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>A lot of people believe in a narrow definition of blockchain.</p>
<p>Blockchain is a decentralized database. Period.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmWiRJ8caPWD3YPtY4QpZucxC1okxWNaZKUMR3mL87Sw2T/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There are also a lot of buzzwords that get associated with blockchain technology. Some people claim that these aspects are just means to deceive investors. Some people believe that blockchain projects can just focus on a few, or even just one, of these aspects to be a successful and positive contribution to the blockchain community and ecosystem. Even others, like bitcoin maximalist and BTCC founder Bobby Lee, believe that blockchain projects must focus on all of this laundry list of advantages in order to be considered a &#x201C;true&#x201D; blockchain project.</p>
<p>Here is the list:</p>
<ul>
<li>A blockchain project should emphasize pseudonymity to give its users a modicum of privacy.</li>
<li>A blockchain project should utilize permissionless consensus in order to allow anyone to participate in verifying transactions.</li>
<li>A blockchain project should operate independently of any centralized authority.</li>
<li>A blockchain project should transparently provide the information contained in its blocks of transactions so that the transaction log is universally and publicly verifiable by any and all who is interested to see it.</li>
<li>A blockchain project should maintain an immutable record of its transactions so that information is 100% reliable.</li>
</ul>
<p>In combination, these aspects enable a &#x201C;true&#x201D; blockchain to focus without a third-party intermediary, thus earning its ultimate descriptive adjective:</p>
<p><strong>TRUSTLESS</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQyD1tPt9jCPSU6ffhbnfq578TYd1Qvu8AA7EuJZjNXrw/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>trustless</em></p>
<p>Is that the whole point of blockchain? Projects like Ripple and EOS fly directly in the face of the strictest interpretation of this ethos.</p>
<p>But the people who have been in this industry the longest, like Bobby Lee, all seem to gravitate towards this philosophy eventually. Does their experience lead them there? Or is it simply because being early investors in bitcoin have made them rich? Or have they done the 10,000 hours (or more) of research necessary to reach this enlightened conclusion?</p>
<p>You may not agree with this perspective, but the strict bitcoin maximalist perspective is invaluable for letting us know how we got to here - the 10th anniversary of <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Satoshi&#x2019;s bitcoin whitepaper</a> - in the first place.</p>
<p>Working in the blockchain industry, it seems part and parcel of the occupation to be constantly changing your opinion on what is and what is not a legitimate and worthy use case for the technology. That&#x2019;s only natural, in my opinion. We are in a fledgling industry that has not established universal standards. There is new information that constantly informs and reshapes the world we think that is around us.</p>
<p>Engaging in civil debate and constructive discourse will form the basis of this revolution. Not the petty squabbling we often see between various cryptocurrency factions.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s why I listen attentively to old hands like Bobby Lee when they give a speech. It&#x2019;s not like they haven&#x2019;t considered what they have to say. In fact, they have a whole career behind them that forms the basis of their opinion. Nevertheless, I don&#x2019;t have to agree with everything they say. That&#x2019;s a healthy aspect of truthseeking. And when you get down to it, that&#x2019;s what really blockchain is all about.</p>
<p>We are seeking truth and hope to make it available to as many people as possible via blockchain. </p>
<p>But I do agree with Mr. Lee when he says, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not about the tokens or the advisors or the ticker symbol or the exchanges you list on&#x2026; It&#x2019;s about the products and services [that your company offers] if you really want to change the world.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

            <p>When I first started getting into blockchain, I found myself confused by a great many of the new vocabulary I had to learn to make myself dangerous in the cryptocurrency space. My friends and I, who have begun their blockchain journey at different times, started a little <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-535980100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast called <em>Block Runners</em></a> in order to provide the community with a quality resource to satisfy its collective curiousity.</p>
<p>This week <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-535980100/show-3-what-the-fork-is-a-fork" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our podcast</a> we discussed one of those fundamental concepts of blockchain that sometimes people tend to gloss over:</p>
<h3 id="Forks"><a href="#Forks" class="headerlink" title="Forks."></a>Forks.</h3><p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQqrv4gB4wSWLWtmVYvfL9hh8fL7JDodEnwyaC7UhfL7E/image.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So let&#x2019;s begin with the most basic question&#x2026;</p>
<h1 id="What-the-fork-is-a-fork"><a href="#What-the-fork-is-a-fork" class="headerlink" title="What the fork is a fork?"></a>What the fork is a fork?</h1><p>The short answer is that when an existing blockchain is forked it creates two new chains at the block height of the fork. At the point of the fork, the two blockchains would start to create new transaction histories distinct from one another. But all blocks of transactions created before the block where the fork takes place would be the same on both chains. The newly forked chain shares the history of all previous transactions made on the parent chain. As it creates its new history, it does so according to a new set of rules. This procedure is, technically, a <strong>hard fork</strong> and that&#x2019;s where the fun begins! Just like fancy silverware, there are different kinds of forks that have different uses.</p>

A fork can be well compared to a spin-off IPO of an unwanted, or incompatible, subsidiary in the stock world. For example, processed foods giant Conagra <a href="https://www.conagrabrands.com/news-room/news-conagra-foods-completes-spin-off-of-lamb-weston-business-and-becomes-conagra-brands-2221373" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently spun-off</a> its frozen potato products division into an entirely new and separately traded company, Lamb Weston (LW). Some investors reinvest earnings from forked coins back into BTC, others accumulate a fat wallet of forked coins on the off-chance that maybe they will be as valuable as BTC one day. But this is very dangerous! You need to do your due diligence on these projects or you might miss your opportunity to maximize profit, as we&#x2019;ll see below.</p>
<h2 id="It&#x2019;s-an-upgrade"><a href="#It&#x2019;s-an-upgrade" class="headerlink" title="It&#x2019;s an upgrade!"></a>It&#x2019;s an upgrade!</h2><p>My podcast cohost, Mr. Lo, contributes a developer&#x2019;s perspective. The word &#x201C;fork&#x201D; has multiple meanings in software development depending on the context. Most recently, the term has been used as an integral part of the process of social software development, a practice made more efficient when Linus Torvald, creator of Linux, unleashed git to the world. Forking allows collaborators on git-based code repositories to organize a project in a decentralized manner. Each contributor has a copy of the original project (OP) and makes changes and improvements locally that they submit as pull-requests to the OP. It&#x2019;s just a part of the workflow where you &#x201C;fork&#x201D; a copy of the code in order to experiment with it. For blockchain projects, a &#x201C;fork&#x201D; is an upgrade mechanism. If the &#x201C;fork&#x201D; is based on consensus, the blockchain doesn&#x2019;t change. If there are political or philosophical differences, the &#x201C;fork&#x201D; can lead to a new coin and a split in the developer community.</p>
<h1 id="What-kind-of-forks-are-there"><a href="#What-kind-of-forks-are-there" class="headerlink" title="What kind of forks are there?"></a>What kind of forks are there?</h1><p>There are three basic types of forks: unintentional, soft fork, and hard fork.</p>
<p><em>Unintentional forks</em> occur in a proof of work consensus system when two miners simultaneously find and broadcast a block to the network. Some miners will hear about one discovery and will start mining on that block, while another set of miners hear about another discovery and starting mining on that one. This confusion causes two concurrent chains to be constructed with slightly different histories. As a protocol, nodes accept the longest chain as the valid chain. In time, one chain will get ahead of the other and that chain will be the sole accepted chain again. Due to this possibility, miners have adopted a rule of thumb to wait for six block confirmations. If there are six block confirmations after the block containing your transaction, the chances that your transaction resides on the longest block is virtually 100%.</p>
<p><em>Soft forks</em> are backward compatible with the old chain. New block rules are more strict and follow a subset of the old block rules so they coexist in the same chain. Miners can choose to adopt the change and if a certain amount of support is generated, the change will be adopted by the network.</p>
<p><em>Hard forks</em> are when a new chain is incompatible with the old chain. This incompatibility happens if the upgrade causes nodes to reject blocks generated by the old node client software. Nodes must simultaneously switch to the new software in order to continue accepting and generating blocks on the new chain. Hard forks are generally used when there is consensus around a network change. Sometimes you just gotta upgrade that software. This type of hard fork, which enjoys consensus of all the miners on the chain, can be called an intentional hard fork. This very STEEM blockchain has conducted 20 hard forks with community consensus that, although they may have been a hassle to the community, provided robust upgrades and wholesale changes to the protocol.</p>
<p>However, if a hard fork does not enjoy consensus, splitting the network can have dire consequences for the system. The community may splinter into two warring factions due to political or philosophical differences.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-most-important-forks-in-crypto-history"><a href="#What-are-the-most-important-forks-in-crypto-history" class="headerlink" title="What are the most important forks in crypto history?"></a>What are the most important forks in crypto history?</h1><p>In the short history of blockchain, there are two fork events that every crypto enthusiast should know about. The first occurred on July 20, 2016 when developers on Ethereum, led by Vitalik Buterin and Consensys among others, rolled back the DAO hack and created a fork on the Ethereum blockchain. The coders that disagreed with this decision stayed on the Ethereum Classic chain. They were apparently okay with this little bit of crypto history:</p>

<p>The second must-know fork occurred on August 1, 2017 when, again due to philosophical differences, a subset of BTC miners chose to create a fork of the bitcoin core code in order to increase the block size of BTC blocks from 1 MB to 8 MB. This fork created Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Both of these forks represent contentious hard forks. By contrast, </p>
<p>In general, knowing about forks in the blockchain industry is important because, as we like to say on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-535980100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Block Runners</em></a>, we want to delineate the good from the bad. Although many forks occur due to legitimate divergences in philosophy, some of these projects are outright cash grabs! If you want to determine the quality of your forked coins, we suggest checking the project&#x2019;s activity on GitHub and the LinkedIn profiles of project leadership. If you find yourself questioning the future of the project after that little bit of research, sell those forking coins!</p>

            <p>Since moving to the big cities of Beijing and Shanghai, I&#x2019;ve become a huge fan of podcasts as a means to soak up all of the time I spend commuting from one place to another.</p>
<p>Back in the days of hustle, I could spend 4-5 hours per day on the subway and walking around the city, so I probably have close to my 10,000 hours necessary to become an expert.</p>
<p>It only makes sense, then, that I eventually wanted to start my own!</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve teamed up with a couple old friends of mine to start <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-535980100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Block Runners</a>. One is the director of the PwC Media Lab here in Shanghai; the other is an aspiring Ethereum developer in New York City.</p>
<p>Between the three of us - a blockchain worker, a newbie, and a developer - we think we&#x2019;ve got a unique perspective to bring to the space. We hope you&#x2019;ll follow us on either <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-535980100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoundCloud</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/block-runners/id1437172347?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a>.</p>
<p>Those are the platforms we currently are on. If anyone else has any suggestions for cool podcast platforms, please let us know in the comments below. &#x1F447;&#x1F447;&#x1F447;</p>

<p>So why did we choose the name Block Runners?</p>
<p>Well, it&#x2019;s totally based on the classic film <em>Blade Runner</em>, one of the all-time favorite films of my family.</p>
<p>Based on Philip K. Dick&#x2019;s amazing novel <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em>, the film explores the dualistic nature of technology - its dialectic capacity to bring massive positive change to society as a whole while also containing within it the spectre of potential harms wrought by evil robots and malicious governments.</p>
<p>Blockchain, like any bleeding-edge technology, contains both sides of this coin.</p>

<p>In this way, our podcast will operate as a bladerunner, which is the character played by Harrison Ford whose goal it was to seek out a rogue robot trying to kill its creator.</p>
<p><em>Block Runners</em> will highlight the good and weed out the bad in the blockchain space.</p>
<p>I hope you&#x2019;ll come along for the ride!</p>
<p>You can listen to our recently released <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-535980100/show-2-interview-with-amal-sudama-ethereum-developer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2nd show</a> where we interview a real live Ethereum developer!</p>
