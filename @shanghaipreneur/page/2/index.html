        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Steve Jobs was a dreamer. He always tried to do what other people said was impossible. Sometimes he failed. But when he was right, his projects were spectacularly successful. Although he did not invent any of the products he is famous for, he was a visionary that inspired a technological and entertainment revolution.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVe9yztXmkoFuUnarJQDv3oFQLaPt8AtFtnY8nsPyTSd6/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>He was born to a young Syrian professor and his American graduate student girlfriend in 1955. Although they would later marry, they put their newborn son up for adoption. In what was the first of many rejections in his life, the first-choice adoptive parents at the last minute decided they wanted a girl. Jobs&#x2019; birth mother had demanded that the adoptive couple be educated and wealthy. But an uneducated Armenian couple who lived in the San Francisco suburbs adopted her unwanted son. That part of California would soon after become to be known as Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Steve&#x2019;s biological mother made Paul and Clara Jobs promise that they would send him to college. They scrimped and saved for 17 years for tuition. As you would an expect from an idealist, Steve went to one of the most expensive schools in the United States. Young Jobs spent 6 months at Reed College before deciding that he &#x201C;couldn&#x2019;t see the value in it.&#x201D; So one of the most successful men in modern history became a penniless dropout. However, he happily spent the next 18 months as a &#x201C;drop-in.&#x201D; He pursued all the classes he was interested in and none that were required. Only later would he be able to &#x201C;connect the dots&#x201D; of the importance of this pursuit.</p>
<p>Jobs returned home to this modest house in Los Altos, California. It is now a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/10/30/tech/innovation/steve-jobs-historic-home/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protected historic site</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmb914cpZ4QEB2fx1SCahHRJP4cQrPqLW9jBdeSbNCgjpY/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>He somehow convinced executives at Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Atari to give him part-time jobs. But at Atari, one of the first video game companies, he clashed with his coworkers. So they only let him work the night shift. He then invited his older friend Steve Wozniak to come and hang out in his garage.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmfMNqN7zDPnSAWx4JMg66k7VpcNdbBSmSFeL3Lrng9GnD/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Wozniak met Jobs at HP. After three years of working in the Jobs family garage, they founded Apple Computer on April 1, 1976. It was Jobs&#x2019; idea. He was the entrepreneur. Wozniak was the engineer. In just four years, Apple had an initial public offering (IPO) that valued the company at 1.7 billion dollars.</p>
<p>300 millionaires, all early Apple employees, were created instantly. It was an &#x201C;orderly&#x201D; debut, as they say, while Steve rocked a similarly &#x201C;orderly&#x201D; mean mustache. Nice!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbrwTGyNtUnzWdvXJ71T4wrAeggd5NTws7Rs1eBJAbUDi/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But Jobs&#x2019; clashes with coworkers continued, even at the company he co-founded. Although he enjoyed the tenuous bond of shared childhood with Wozniak, he was stubborn, impolite, and obstinate with others. He drove his Macintosh team too hard. The Board of Directors fired him in 1985.</p>
<p>Jobs later said, &#x201C;Getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me&#x2026; [It was] awful tasting medicine but I guess the patient needed it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The medicine worked. Within the next year, he founded two billion-dollar companies.</p>
<p>In his famous 2005 Stanford commencement speech, Jobs claimed it was one of the &#x201C;most creative periods in my life.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZhWTLDaak2cz7mv7So25PUp4iDTxGJ8pJ6iL8XbpzHSz/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>NeXT was a computer company. In 1996, Apple paid $429 million to NeXT investors and gave 1.5 million shares of Apple stock to Jobs for his company. The NeXT operating system became the basis for Apple&#x2019;s immensely successful OS X.</p>
<p>That stock grant would have been worth tens of billions today. However, Jobs almost <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/its-official-jobs-sold-apple-stock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immediately sold the stock grant</a> for just $22 million in 1997 because he &#x201C;had given up hope that the Apple board was going to do anything.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He was still shellshocked from his first experience with corporate Apple and was riding high on his other company&#x2019;s <em>Toy Story</em> success. &#x201C;If that upsets employees, I&#x2019;m perfectly happy to go home to Pixar,&#x201D; he said at the time.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbLSY9g7AjTvWTEtiQ5gvYS453CkZSm889neEx8nYjGqq/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Pixar Animation Studios was an even more successful startup for Jobs. Most of the Jobs family&#x2019;s current wealth derives  from his time at Pixar and not from his considerably longer time working for Apple.</p>
<p>When Disney bought his company for $7.6 billion in 2006, Jobs took his share in Disney stock. He was granted 138 million shares. After Disney&#x2019;s success buying Marvel and Lucasfilm, that stake became worth tens of billions of dollars. Later, Steve&#x2019;s widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, would <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/steve-jobs-family-cuts-disney-stake-in-half-1485946054" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sell half the Disney stake</a> to become a minority shareholder in the NBA&#x2019;s Washington Wizards and NHL&#x2019;s Washington Capitals, among other means of diversifying her portfolio.</p>
<p>The NeXT acquisition helped reinstall Jobs as Apple CEO. At the time, Apple was almost bankrupt. But he somehow convinced his archrival and long-time nemesis Bill Gates to save his company with a $150 million investment. That investment is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014/05/20/what-ever-became-of-microsofts-150-million-investment-in-apple/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a whole nother story</a> where Microsoft ends up missing out on $20+ billion.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmaGbDk3WUUxhvjKmbxXaef3fAW6GuoH4MJLwPCemKD4pZ/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Jobs then went on the most successful run of product innovation in the history of mankind. He introduced the iMac in 1998, the iPod in 2001, the iPhone in 2007, and the iPad in 2010. Despite Steve Jobs&#x2019; premature death on October 5, 2011, Apple Inc. became the first company to achieve a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45050213" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trillion-dollar</a> valuation.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s quite a long way from college dropout&#x2026;</p>

        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I don&#x2019;t know about you, but when I woke up this morning, the markets were red red red. I looked at my <a href="https://share.robinhood.com/nicholk1042" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood</a> notifications and thought &#x201C;No, that can&#x2019;t be right. There&#x2019;s no way Ethereum is $141&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
<h2 id="Wait-WHAT"><a href="#Wait-WHAT" class="headerlink" title="Wait. WHAT?"></a>Wait. WHAT?</h2><p>##</p>
<p>Ethereum was $140. Bitcoin was $5000.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, it must be some kind of FUD,&#x201D; I thought. &#x201C;I wonder if it&#x2019;s China FUD or Tether FUD?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Well, as most of you already know, this time it was Tether FUD.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdb6cYeRdS1igweaebWnBFTBZccj3Gyc6mya7Nq5zU4R4/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is a great pic from this <a href="https://finsof.net/tether-fud-ponzi-legit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> from one of the many times our old friend Tether Fudd has decided to pay us an unannounced visit.</p>
<p>Stay calm. It&#x2019;s not a big deal. This has happened before and will happen again. Sure, USDT is not the most straight-forward transparent stablecoin out there. And neither is the USD currency. Both USD and USDT derive their value from 3 sources: 1) their abundant supply, 2) their nearly universal acceptance (almost all crypto exchanges have USDT), and 3) their unparalleled dispersion throughout the world.</p>
<p>And none of that is affected by a little FUD generated by the ruling of the financial regulator of a single state in Murica. In fact, one has to wonder what kind of sway a New York state regulator really has over Bitfinex and Tether, which are both owned and operated by iFinex Inc., a company which is headquartered in Hong Kong and registered in the British Virgin Islands. I&#x2019;m pretty sure Americans are not allowed to trade on Bitfinex, so this all seems a lot a whole lot of sound and fury signifying nothing. That&#x2019;s why crypto traders have learned to &#x2026;</p>
<h2 id="ALWAYS-BUY-TETHER-FUD-ABTF"><a href="#ALWAYS-BUY-TETHER-FUD-ABTF" class="headerlink" title="ALWAYS BUY TETHER FUD #ABTF"></a>ALWAYS BUY TETHER FUD #ABTF</h2><p>##</p>
<p>Case in point: <a href="https://quantfury.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quantfury</a>, a startup platform that provides unmatched trading conditions for currently mostly crypto traders across all asset classes - think BitMEX and eToro crossed with Robinhood - has never had a day with more than $20 million in trading volume. You see, they don&#x2019;t allow bot trading via APIs so it&#x2019;s a great proxy for true trader sentiment in the cryptoverse. And today, which pretty much began with an opening salvo by Tether Fudd, the platform is seeing almost $27 million in volume today. That&#x2019;s more than double their average daily volume for the past week and approximately 35% higher than their all-time trading volume high.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdNEAFDgw6LMiX4naN3Z6bWYfCmyadLD9kmL8fYXTBuPj/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-26%20at%2011.45.21%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-04-26 at 11.45.21 PM.png"></p>
<p>Apparently the traders on their platform subscribe to ABTF as well.</p>
<p>Another aspect to think about is that stablecoins are an industry unto themselves at this point. In this regard, I think <a href="https://messari.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Messari</a> has it right. They have removed the stablecoins from their Coinmarketcap-style league table and placed them in their own <a href="https://stablecoinindex.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stablecoin Index</a>. It&#x2019;s kind of beautiful. Right now they only list 8 stablecoins with a combined market cap of $3.59 billion.</p>
<p>From a supply perspective, USDT makes up about 80% of the supply. But from a trading perspective, USDT is involved in 96.3% of all stablecoin trades. That is quite a massive headstart in this emerging industry. Tether FUD is a way to give the TUSD, USDC, PAX, GUSD, and DAI&#x2019;s of the world a chance to maybe pick up some of that market share. Does the fact that GUSD&#x2019;s parent company Gemini is located in New York City matter? Maybe, maybe not. But I don&#x2019;t think that fact can be ignored either.</p>
<p>That leaves us with the simple maxim, #ABTF.</p>
<p>One that we can repeat whenever we hear charges like this in the future. #ABTF.</p>
<p>One that can comfort us whenever we wake up in the middle of the night and our Blockfolio screams red, red, red!</p>

        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I didn&#x2019;t invest a lot of money into cryptocurrency and digital assets back in 2017. I remember thinking what a big deal it was when I decided to put 1% of my investment portfolio into BTC, ETH, and NEO (of all things! &#x1F629;). To me, that was a reasonable amount to invest, relatively, into magic internet money.</p>
<p>I think, in the runup to the miraculous bull run of late 2017 and early 2018, I may have let myself get caught up in the frenzy enough that I contributed approximately 5% of my investment capital into cryptocurrency and then, through appreciation alone,  that got up to about 15%. I took a little profit in early 2018 but, of course in retrospect, not enough.</p>
<p>But that&#x2019;s on me. I&#x2019;m not blaming anyone for those &#x201C;losses.&#x201D; Because, really, they&#x2019;re not actual losses. Just like they&#x2019;re not gains until you sell, whatever I had on paper in January 2018, I really didn&#x2019;t have in actual value. Who knows? If I had tried to sell NEO at $185 I might have crashed the market with my bag!</p>
<p>I now know what caused me to miss out on those profits. And that had nothing to do with anything else but me. What caused me to do what in retrospect was so stupid? That&#x2019;s easy.</p>
<h2 id="Greed"><a href="#Greed" class="headerlink" title="Greed."></a>Greed.</h2><p>##<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmeBPpjPA2m9sWe8RkWpN8pbXb2qMspZo1Vn1jT7AZhpk6/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>##<br>To put it simply, I thought NEO was going to $300. To this day, I&#x2019;m not ever sure what my logic was, but I distinctly remember thinking that on multiple occasions. </p>
<p>Oh well. Live and learn. &#x1F937;&#x1F3FB;&#x200D;&#x2642;&#xFE0F;</p>
<h2 id="The-great-thing-about-life-is-that-you-get-to-live-another-day-and-try-and-do-better-next-time"><a href="#The-great-thing-about-life-is-that-you-get-to-live-another-day-and-try-and-do-better-next-time" class="headerlink" title="The great thing about life is that you get to live another day and try and do better next time."></a>The great thing about life is that you get to live another day and try and do better next time.</h2><p>##<br>What I am most thankful for in this experience is that I had studied portfolio management long and hard enough to avoid the single most common pitfall that pretty much singlehandedly REKT anybody who stayed invested in crypto in 2018. I mean it sounds so simple when you say it but, in fact, it is quite difficult. Emotions usually get the better of most of us. So it&#x2019;s important to have established some rational guidelines you can harken back to BEFORE things get emotional.</p>
<p>Probably the most important guidance for investors is easier said than done.</p>
<h2 id="Don&#x2019;t-put-all-your-eggs-in-one-basket"><a href="#Don&#x2019;t-put-all-your-eggs-in-one-basket" class="headerlink" title="Don&#x2019;t put all your eggs in one basket."></a>Don&#x2019;t put all your eggs in one basket.</h2><p>##<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbSadDymYR4MEJ5NpN6yC9h4aTK1fHw7kq1UsMoPynUWJ/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Because the chances are high when you do that that you are gonna break some eggs. Just like this. I mean that brilliant investment idea that you think no one else has and you are ready to go AWL EEN on? It just might work out. Or it might not. If you lose all your powder in one last showdown, you might go down in a blaze of glory, but you ain&#x2019;t playing again. Not with that capital, at least. So maximize your chances while ensuring that you live to see another day. And play again.</p>
<p>And yet, I still hear about people who put money into coins crying, &#x201C;I lost millions.&#x201D; Or in Chinese, &#x201C;&#x6211;&#x7684;&#x4E09;&#x767E;&#x4E07;&#x53D8;&#x6210;20&#x4E07;&#x3002;(My 3 million has become 200,000!) Well, that&#x2019;s awful. But did you really do that without &#x201C;millions&#x201D; invested in other assets? That&#x2019;s just crazy. I can&#x2019;t imagine going all in on digital assets, literally, to where they were 100% of my investment portfolio. I mean maybe once we have security tokens and a reliable wallet to store them in&#x2026;  but we are far from that right now.</p>
<p>Intuitively, I think most people understand that. But when emotions get involved, the picture is much cloudier. For instance, nearly everyone, including myself, falls prey to the great killer of investment alpha: the sunk cost fallacy.</p>
<h2 id="The-sunk-cost-fallacy-leads-investors-to-throw-good-money-after-bad-by-doubling-down-on-their-worst-investments-so-that-they-can-&#x201C;more-quickly-get-their-money-back-&#x201D;"><a href="#The-sunk-cost-fallacy-leads-investors-to-throw-good-money-after-bad-by-doubling-down-on-their-worst-investments-so-that-they-can-&#x201C;more-quickly-get-their-money-back-&#x201D;" class="headerlink" title="The sunk cost fallacy leads investors to throw good money after bad by doubling down on their worst investments, so that they can &#x201C;more quickly get their money back.&#x201D;"></a>The sunk cost fallacy leads investors to throw good money after bad by doubling down on their worst investments, so that they can &#x201C;more quickly get their money back.&#x201D;</h2><p>##<br>Yeah, somehow way back in the lizard part of your brain, it sounds good to lower your cost basis. I guess the thinking is that your investment, once it eventually goes back to your original buy-in price, will bring you that much more in return at that point. The problem is that IT MIGHT NEVER GO BACK TO THAT PRICE EVER AGAIN. The logic here is flawed.</p>
<p>Instead of investing money in your best ideas at the moment, the ones which supposedly have the most potential to gain at that precise time, you invest in an idea simply because you have invested in it before. It is literally like saying, &#x201C;The last time I ate this food it made me sick. So I will eat it again because maybe now I have built an immunity to it, and if not, maybe this time I eat it and get sick will get me that much closer to a time where eventually I can eat it and not got sick.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVDUq9GkrQsqhzsU5aZNGMtB1gBLN9j5KgyHbcHUFaHYj/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Greed, lack of portfolio diversification, and sunk cost fallacy are some of the reasons why most people fail to outperform even a basic stock index fund like <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY?p=SPY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPY</a>. But by far the worst investor trait that young investors use to try and CRUSH the markets, the most dangerous threat to your financial independence surely, is leverage.</p>
<h2 id="Leverage-itself-is-neither-good-nor-bad-It-merely-amplifies-your-investment-decisions"><a href="#Leverage-itself-is-neither-good-nor-bad-It-merely-amplifies-your-investment-decisions" class="headerlink" title="Leverage itself is neither good nor bad. It merely amplifies your investment decisions."></a>Leverage itself is neither good nor bad. It merely amplifies your investment decisions.</h2><p>##<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmPGEQUnuvoz12oyQ1UH4sJWyDx66oHuiVpNjWXZRjfHrr/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But that is why when you are young and inexperienced, on its face, borrowing money to make investments is a decidedly bad idea. Without investing experience, you are just amplifying your learning curve. That&#x2019;s not very likely to be a winning formula. Most of the world&#x2019;s best investors, like Warren Buffett or Bill Ackman, don&#x2019;t really hit their stride until they are well into their 40s and 50s.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you are using leverage, and if that money is coming from friends and family, and they do not agree to the sharing of the investment risk, it can destroy relationships. If that money is borrowed on your own behalf, and the investment does not perform according to your expectations, you could be hamstringing yourself for years, or even decades.</p>
<p>So don&#x2019;t do it!</p>
<p>And yet, every time there is a bull run in some asset class, the same process is repeated. The smart money that has played this game over and over again throughout their lives come in and grab their 50% to 100%. Then calmly leave out the front door, leaving a mass of noob retail investors to fight over the last 20% to 30% scraps at the top. Firmly secure atop their pile of cash, waiting for the next bubble to appear in some other asset class at a later date, these guys watch as everything crashes around the retail investors, 60-70-80% losses in some unfortunate positions are the norm in such a situation. And if you committed one of the &#x201C;capital&#x201D; sins above anywhere near that bull market top&#x2026; Well, God help you.</p>
<p>The only thing left for you to do is pick yourself up and </p>

            <p>Eh, sure, we&#x2019;re in a little downdraft for bitcoin price right now. But let&#x2019;s take a look at the bigger picture here.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting projects in Crypto Land these days, in my opinion, is what Overstock (OSTK) is doing to transform its business. Its founder and CEO Patrick Byrne has always been an interesting character who speaks his mind. In my own business dealings, I try to maintain truth and honesty at all costs, so I guess I&#x2019;m a little predisposed to appreciate whatever Byrne is up to. As a Warren Buffett aficionado, I also respect the family pedigree. Patrick&#x2019;s father was John J. Byrne, former longtime CEO of GEICO, White Mountains Insurance Group, and Fireman&#x2019;s Fund (a former American Express subsidiary). All of these assets were important contributions to the huge success of Berkshire Hathaway shares in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmPVvAnhNAXZv5AGQADnF89i5BJcmajwqRacheATZ8FS9c/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Son Patrick is in the midst of transforming his American e-commerce also-ran into a premier collection of blockchain-based companies under the <a href="https://www.mediciventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medici Ventures</a> umbrella, a wholly-owned subsidiary of OSTK.</p>
<p>Why is that a good strategy?</p>
<p>As <a href="http://freakonomics.com/podcast/jack-welch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Welch</a> is probably most famous for saying (he&#x2019;s famous for a lot of things I know), you need to collect assets that are either #1 or #2 in their respective industries. You can try for a while to vault yourself into that premier echelon, but if it becomes obvious you will not be able to get there, you need to sell that asset or get rid of it altogether. Some people have called this philosophy Jack Welch&#x2019;s <a href="https://sacredstructures.org/movement/burning-platform-metaphor-organizational-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Burning Platform</a>.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the dot-com era, OSTK was competing more or less directly with Amazon (AMZN). These days, however, they&#x2019;ve dropped back to at least #4 in the e-commerce arena. Amazon, as you probably know, is one of the most valuable companies in the world. Wal-mart, after years of missteps in this arena, has recently gone on a tear in the e-commerce space after acquiring <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2018/09/13/walmart-jet-redesign-new-york/#5a0f253c16f9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jet.com</a> and 12% of Alibaba&#x2019;s chief competitor, <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/08/12/walmart-jdcom-tighten-alliance-500-million-invest.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JD.com</a>. Recently, loss leader <a href="https://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/how-wayfair-became-a-4-billion-dollar-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wayfair</a> has maneuvered its way into third place. And then there is all the little guys enabled by e-tail infrastructure provider <a href="https://techvibes.com/2015/09/04/a-brief-history-of-shopify-2015-09-04" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a> and crafts marketplace <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/03/05/a-brief-history-of-etsy-from-2005-brooklyn-launch-to-2015-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etsy</a>.</p>
<p>In short, in the immortal words of the greatest guitar player of all time,</p>
<h1 id="They-say-two-thousand-zero-zero-party-over-oops-out-of-time"><a href="#They-say-two-thousand-zero-zero-party-over-oops-out-of-time" class="headerlink" title="They say two thousand zero zero party over, oops, out of time"></a>They say two thousand zero zero party over, oops, out of time</h1><p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmaSFdEcBzaopwehNyTwfWdynXQh6Xn6eeT5awC41gTNgu/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And that&#x2019;s okay! Business is about the pivot. And certainly not about throwing good money after bad.</p>
<p>As CEO Byrne said in the most recent <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4249577-overstock-com-inc-ostk-ceo-patrick-byrne-q4-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings call</a>, &#x201C;I realized, it was a mistake to try to chase this competitor [Wayfair], and we had to revert to our DNA, which is focusing on value and running the company to profitability.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The plan going forward for OSTK seems to be quite Berkshire-y, to be honest. If Byrne can&#x2019;t sell the the e-commerce platform for cash, then he can clearly use it as a cash-flow generator and deploy excess profits into the long-term value-generating machine that is Medici.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdkaDB5EsZpizXbW7Ebus42WaaHj3nwkpcAHatiiSayMz/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It&#x2019;s true <a href="https://www.valuewalk.com/2015/02/ben-graham-warren-buffett-cigar-butt-investing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ben Graham style cigar butt investing</a> at its finest. Only Byrne didn&#x2019;t even have to acquire the e-commerce business for cheap. He built it from scratch!</p>
<h1 id="Everything-happens-for-a-reason"><a href="#Everything-happens-for-a-reason" class="headerlink" title="Everything happens for a reason."></a>Everything happens for a reason.</h1><p>One of the reasons that OSTK fell so far behind AMZN in the post-dot com crash era was a <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2015/11/10/a-companys-battle-to-show-it-was-a-victim-of-abusive-short-selling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-running obsession</a> with &#x201C;naked&#x201D; short-selling that definitely led them to keep their off the ball against such a formidable opponent as <a href="https://steemit.com/life/@shanghaipreneur/casesin-success-1-jeff-bezos-of-amazon-amzn-1544677232307" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Bezos</a>.</p>
<p>That has led them to create one of the more intriguing blockchain products out there - the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/overstock-release-blockchain-product-curb-naked-short-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Locate Receipt</a> - which should enable exchanges to track the supply of actual shares available to trade and prevent people from shorting a stock without having any of the shares in their possession. This is where the term &#x201C;naked&#x201D; comes from.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNjDEuFSK2FEeqhhQjEf9bGL5V9BYeiXKkU5HSjk6Qarp/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It&#x2019;s all finance nerd stuff. But that&#x2019;s what has lead Medici to create its crown jewel asset, <a href="https://www.tzero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tzero</a>, in a bid to fix all the myriad things that are wrong with our existing financial system. The name of the exchange is a play on how trades are settled today. Even despite digital technology that could record the transfer of ownership of any asset instantly, somehow regulators have allowed bourses to continue the practice of recording share transfer activity and then &#x201C;settle&#x201D; those trades 2 days later. For some reason, the industry standard is transaction plus two days (or T+2 as it is most often referred to) for settlement of trades. Given that we have AI bots making most trades on most exchanges in the world today, it absolutely makes no sense that this is how we do things today in the finance world.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmats2NrvTKy43MMojg7cp8L2yZdTsTvErViP3mArKn1DC/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The second most interesting company in the Medici stable is <a href="https://www.mediciland.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medici Land Governance</a> (MLG). In a world where 2/3 of the world&#x2019;s citizens are unbanked and live on property that is not properly deeded to them, you can start to understand just how massively important this project could be to lifting the world&#x2019;s poor out of poverty. The basis for wealth for almost anybody derives from their ability to own properly deeded property. MLG creates bespoke technology stacks for governments to leapfrog into the 21st century world of land titling, administration, and tax revenue generation. Even my home county in the United States does not have this tech! If you want to create a deed chain today, you need to pay a lawyer to go down to the courthouse and research the history of that address for a day to tell you who owned what structures and where exactly they were built on a defined piece of land, from today all the way back to ever since the government split up that piece of property into an individual lot. It&#x2019;s an expensive, handmade research process that is ripe for disruption.</p>
<p>With that background taken care of, world citizens can far more easily access loans to expand a business, weather rough times, or make investments in their community. That&#x2019;s why MLG has partnered with the World Bank to spread this technology to as many places as possible as quickly as possible. Byrne states in the conference call, &#x201C;The World Bank is frankly taking us all over the world to make introductions for us to do projects. It&#x2019;s really a matter of how quickly we can build the modules and spin them up.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Other interesting projects in the Medici portfolio are Bitt, which owns an mMoney wallet that is being integrated into the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, and Vinsent, which is connecting wine connoisseurs directly with wineries to ensure that high-end wines are not fake and properly distributed.</p>
<p>And these are just 4 of the 20-plus blockchain ventures that Medici has directly invested in or started on their own from scratch.</p>
<p>Tzero and MLG could easily become unicorns in the not-too-distant future. And if that happens, OSTK stock could be a multi-bagger just based off their potential alone. But what if overstock.com gets sold for more powder that can be plowed into the Medici portfolio? Then we are talking about BRK-style returns in the long run. Especially when you consider that, if overstock.com is sold, OSTK stock will be the only sufficiently large and liquid blockchain pure play that is currently trading on the stock market.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>An investment bank in your pocket. That&#x2019;s where we&#x2019;re headed.</p>
<p>When I first moved to China in 2011, I had to carry around three electronic devices wherever I went.</p>
<ul>
<li>An iPod, because I needed the Chinese-English dictionary (Pleco is the one I use.) to survive.</li>
<li>A Flip video camera (Hard to believe this company was once <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/13/technology/13flip.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired for $590 million</a>, huh? Especially since most of you have probably never heard of it!)</li>
<li>A Nokia-like brick phone (Tencent had still somehow figured out how to code up a basic version of QQ to put on it. And thank God! Or I would have never been able to court my now wife.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh yeah, and a thick-ass wallet full of business cards, credit cards, and a wad full of paper bills that somehow function as money.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s weird. The more deeply I enmesh myself in this digital asset world, the weirder it is whenever I have to pay someone with stacks of fiat. It&#x2019;s like, &#x201C;What is THIS?&#x201D;</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m convinced that in the not-too-distant future, my now 2-year-old daughter will start to ask me, &#x201C;Daddy, why did people work so hard day in and day out for THAT stuff? It&#x2019;s just paper!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now I just walk around with my phone. And if the wife is out, I sometimes have to carry my keys.</p>
<p>But that&#x2019;s it.</p>
<p>Things change. And the more entangled the economy becomes with the exponential tentacles of Moore&#x2019;s Law and its perpetual iterative effects, the faster things change.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re headed to an investment bank in your pocket. Crypto funds, mutual funds, private equity, venture capital, bonds, startups, hedge funds, and esoteric assets like fractions of art pieces, comic book collections, Legos, and whiskey. Tokenized and compliant and custodied by yourself. All in a cryptographically secure wallet on your phone. Recoverable from your seed phrase.</p>
<p>Mark it down, Dude.</p>

<p>Just a little quick update to mark what seems to be like yet another springtime crypto bull. Last year at this time, almost to the day, I remember coming back from teaching a finance class. I looked down at my phone on the way into the train station and bitcoin prices were hovering around $7000. By the time I got to the platform and was waiting for my train, I looked down at my phone again and</p>
<p>BAM! $7800.</p>
<p>A 10% rise out of literally nowhere.</p>
<p>That was April 12, 2018. At about 8pm or so China time (8am EST), if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>This year, the date and time of infamy for the &#x201C;Whoa! Where did this random bitcoin pump come from?&#x201D; will be</p>
<p>April 3, 2019. Sometime around 12:40 pm China time the market suddenly jumped from approximately $4200 to $5000 within an hour.</p>
<p>How do I know this so specifically?</p>
<p>Because it was me that caused it.</p>
<p>I mean, right? Just take a look at this <a href="https://twitter.com/shanghaipreneur/status/1112935388094627840?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a><br>I made at exactly 12:30 pm on that date.<br>Hmmmm&#x2026; could it have been some twitter sentiment bot misinterpreting this tweet as a new price target for BTC and then triggering a cascading wave of bullish buy signals, which then triggered a massive series of margin calls, which then led to FOMO across the world and the inauguration of a new cryptocurrency hysteria&#x2026;</p>
<p>It couldn&#x2019;t have been&#x2026; or could it?</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s the butterfly effect in full effect.</p>
<p>Crazier things have happened you know&#x2026;</p>
