        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I have been involved with or directly working for a company in the blockchain industry for over a year now. I&#x2019;ve seen the nosebleed highs as well as the debilitating lows. I no longer really care about what number my Blockfolio balance is willing to blare out to me 24/7/365.</p>
<p>Crypto is not about lambos and moons and creating some idealized anarcho-libertarian universe where everyone is their own bank and The Man gets unceremoniously taken out through the back door.</p>
<p>There are plenty of projects for that! And I wish them luck. I&#x2019;ll even own some of their cryptocurrency for the long term. You know, just in case&#x2026;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNdzpsQXJWTfUDJYthL6hUaSiCuaYiapgHsU8q3vARyUq/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For me, working in the blockchain industry is more about supporting and encouraging meaningful change.</p>
<p>The kind of change that impacts lives.</p>
<p>The kind of change that can be meaningfully measured.</p>
<p>The kind of change that you can tell your family about.</p>
<p>The kind of change we need.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQ8ASppe5CNqG23gkTEZMu9e9kRXuf44dZsg7beYSn28Z/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But change not just in the sense that a politician uses it.</p>
<p>Real change that impacts lives and transforms society. Satoshi Nakomoto created Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology in the hopes that it might one day lead to a more equitable society where the distance between the haves and the have-nots was no longer as wide as an ocean and widening. Being born of a particular color in a particular country determines 95% of your fate these days. And that&#x2019;s not right.</p>
<p>Something needs to change. And fast.</p>
<p>For me, we can only solve this tremendous problem and bring benefits to the global economy if we increase blockchain adoption tremendously.</p>
<p>That means always doing this handy list of 3 action items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work with the right people who care about the right things,</li>
<li>Encourage every smart person you meet to learn more and get involved, and</li>
<li>Call out the folks using blockchain technology as just another pyramid Ponzi scheme.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have to do these three things over and over. And over and over. And over and over again. Until we&#x2019;re blue in the face and have made the same statement a million times before. Sure, the people nearest to you are going to get tired of hearing you repeatedly tell the same stories.</p>
<p>But we owe it to ourselves and our future.</p>
<p>Blockchain might be the last chance we get to create a digital future unlike our analog past.</p>

        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>If the Trump election didn&#x2019;t raise your antenna to the prospect (or likelihood) of fake news, the Goldman Sachs crypto FUD from a couple weeks ago should have reminded you that the news isn&#x2019;t very news-y any more.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, we lived in a world where the mainstream media was the &#x201C;fourth estate&#x201D; and it acted as a check and balance on the other three estates. Incidentally, those are religion, nobility, and the common people. Back in the good old days, we could count on underpaid scribes like Bob Woodward to roost out the nefarious misdeeds of those in power, whether it be clergymen diddling altar boys, presidents directing thieves under cover of night, or the notorious Florida Man who is always out to do some kind of evil along the back roads of that awkward American state.</p>
<p>But in these neoliberal modern times, where &#x201C;the business of business is business&#x201D; and society doesn&#x2019;t let us question the motives of businessmen any more than that, the &#x201C;fourth estate&#x201D; has been coopted by the nobility. In the twenty-first century, that would be the rich people. Now that Trump is president, we can pretty easily state that the government is also the rich people, which is a happy &amp; convenient state of affairs - if you&#x2019;re rich!</p>
<p>Nowadays, fake news hits the 24-hour news cycle and the market instantly reacts. Even if people recognize the duplicity, it doesn&#x2019;t matter because 80% of the trading volume in capital markets is commanded by bots. Those artificially intelligent software protocols automatically scan the day&#x2019;s headlines and make immediate trading decisions.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZRdMeQypMsUrNTV1cz7FETvpyXsg9cnqwCNZg9A2Angd/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So fake news has a tremendous impact, especially in the crypto markets where bots and fake volume make up almost the entire market during bear cycles.</p>
<p>This state of affairs means that the low volume days of a bear lull are especially prone to fake news attacks. As with anything that is so technologically fresh that it outpaces the formulation of the laws necessary to control it, scammers are everywhere. And they take all shapes.</p>
<p>In reaction to the now debunked Goldman news, bitcoin (BTC) fell a maximum of almost 14% as a result. It still has yet to recover. Even with news that&#x2019;s not really fake - like Vitalik Buterin stating the obvious that 1000x returns were a thing of the past - trading bots and capital deployed by those &#x201C;in the know&#x201D; can wreak havoc on cryptoasset prices across the board.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQ2nxPpXb9npLnZwKfkPdTbZhLaR3H5ZwJmpqasG5D2JN/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But that&#x2019;s how it is in financial markets without regulation.</p>
<p>It just is.</p>
<p>If we want that to change, we need to pressure our rich Congresspeople to do something about it. Otherwise, the 98% of the world that doesn&#x2019;t know about cryptocurrency or blockchain assets will never be properly informed, much less convinced to place their hard-earned money into these types of investments.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular opinion, regulation will not limit the crypto markets. It is the best and only chance we have of making them bloom!</p>
<p>If the G20 governments don&#x2019;t do it soon, the blockchain industry will find ways around it anyway. Decentralized exchanges and crypto havens like Malta and Lichtenstein will provide the answers.</p>
<p>But those solutions will never be as satisfying as China, England, or the United States flat out codifying what everyone on Steemit already knows:</p>
<h2 id="Bitcoin-is-cool"><a href="#Bitcoin-is-cool" class="headerlink" title="Bitcoin is cool!"></a>Bitcoin is cool!</h2><p><strong>And it&#x2019;s a perfectly fine globally decentralized form of money that is ripe to disrupt a centuries-old corrupt-driven financial system coopted by the nobility.</strong></p>
<p>Go figure.</p>
<p>Just like it took a Republican president (Richard Nixon) to open up &#x201C;Red China&#x201D; and a Democratic president (Bill Clinton) to deregulate the American financial markets completely (so that the richest among us could make a whole bunch of money before the system&#x2019;s inevitable collapse in 2008)&#x2026;</p>
<p>Yeah, just like those two milestones required a counterintuitive action by a seeming opponent to the idea to make them happen, that&#x2019;s what will happen with regulation and crypto.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s just the nature of the dialectic.</p>
<p>So, c&#x2019;mon guys. Let&#x2019;s face it. Let&#x2019;s stop asking dumb questions.</p>
<p>You know the ones I&#x2019;m talking about!</p>
<p>In case you forgot, here&#x2019;s a list of silly questions cryptoasset investors ask in public chat rooms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When tokens?</p>
</li>
<li><p>When exchange?</p>
</li>
<li><p>When update?</p>
</li>
<li><p>When moon?</p>
</li>
<li><p>When Lambo?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, really&#x2026; is that what this whole &#x201C;blockchain will revolutionize the international financial system&#x201D; is all about?</p>
<p>The answer is no. HELL NO. To all of those questions. (I know, I know. That&#x2019;s not even answer to some of those questions, but I think you get my point.)</p>
<p>We need to be paying attention to a much more important question these days:</p>
<p>When regulation?</p>
<p>Whenever we get a firm answer to that burning question is when the whole blockchain industry will know that the bottom is in and the only way forward is up.</p>
<p>Way up.</p>

            <p>I love spreading the word about TBOs! In my mind, it&#x2019;s just a better all-around fundraising solution. It&#x2019;s pretty clear that the easy money has been made in this industry. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean that there aren&#x2019;t a lot of opportunities out there to make life-changing investments. Now may be the perfect time to commit fresh capital to the cryptosphere due to the evolving nature of token-based capital raises. The blockchain asset industry is moving away from funding the dreams of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/outofasia/2017/12/18/icos-in-2017-from-two-geeks-and-a-whitepaper-to-professional-fundraising-machines/#5e732ec9139e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#x201C;two geeks and a whitepaper&#x201D;</a> via public crowdsales, or what many people call initial coin offerings (ICOs), toward a dilution-free extension of the entrepreneurial runway via tokenized business offerings (TBOs).</p>
<p>People just haven&#x2019;t realized yet that that&#x2019;s what is happening. ICOs, at least in the traditional way that we refer to them, are dead. The days of raising $40 million in an hour via the Ethereum network are gone, never to come back again. The plummeting value of ETH proves this maxim.</p>
<p>No crowdsales, no use case for ETH, no value.</p>
<p>That was the message I spread on Thursday September 6 at Let&#x2019;s Talk Blockchain, a community event organizer sponsored by <a href="http://www.viewfin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ViewFin</a>, the company behind the very first Chinese cryptocurrency project <a href="https://mvs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaverse</a>(ETP).</p>

<p>The main thesis of my talk was that fundraising mechanisms are always evolving. The main idea that spurred the traditional ICO to prominence in 2017 is a reaction to the dramatically reduced access that regular folk have to the part of the capital markets where potentially life-changing, alpha-generating investments exist. The longer that bleeding-edge technology behemoths stay private, the less impact their going public has on the wallet of the common man.</p>
<p>PE and VC whales, and the rich families and lucky individuals that fund them, get bigger and bigger. The <em>hoi polloi</em> minnows get more and more painted into the corner of workaday life.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmaVDbcMwc4yEt5oahUtEjWF4W3Lf4hmfGaqbyTT4WeUrp/IMG_2703.JPG" alt="IMG_2703.JPG"></p>
<p>Traditional ICOs were supposed to disrupt that powerful trend. But, as is often the case with new movements, they were coopted by the very forces they were intending to displace. Such is the power of the dialectic. Private sales, read VC whales, and certainly not crowdsales, are how blockchain startups raise money these days. That looks like it is going to be the case for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#x2019;t mean that token-based capital raises don&#x2019;t have a future!</p>
<p>Token-based capital raises are just evolving, like all funding mechanisms do. Their next, better iteration is TBO.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-a-TBO"><a href="#What-is-a-TBO" class="headerlink" title="What is a TBO?"></a>What is a TBO?</h1><p>A tokenized business offering (TBO) creates a tokenized <strong>ecosystem</strong> based around an <strong>existing platform</strong> solution that requires an easily verifiable <strong>utility token</strong> to unlock features of the platform. They may often require <strong>staking</strong> those tokens on a blockchain as a prerequisite for platform participants to perform work, and get compensated with utility tokens for that work, in the ecosystem.</p>

<p>That&#x2019;s my idea and I think it&#x2019;s pretty useful in terms of wresting power away from the powerful forces of private money and giving some of that power back to entrepreneurs and their minnow investors directly.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ll keep telling this story for as long as people are willing to listen. It&#x2019;s that important to me, to investors, and to the overall future of the blockchain industry.</p>

            <p>Foreigners aren&#x2019;t allowed to buy cryptocurrency in Korea any more.</p>
<p>So usually the guards don&#x2019;t let people that look like me into the posh <a href="https://upbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UpBit</a> customer service lounge that at one point last year was teeming with crypto traders nonstop. You see - in 2017, Korean exchanges opened up retail outlets to encourage investors to come in and directly contribute their paper fiat KRW into their crypto trading accounts. The practice led to a price disparity known as the <a href="http://www.atimes.com/article/how-asian-crypto-traders-leverage-the-kimchi-premium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kimchi Premium</a> that savvy international investors with access to the Korean crypto markets exploited for quick, easy gains.</p>
<p>But I had a trick up my sleeve that would hopefully gain me access to the &#x201C;Koreans only&#x201D; interior of the trading lounge - I had a #Hashed coffee cup.</p>
<p><img src="https://image-store.slidesharecdn.com/870d4ac9-4802-4bfe-acf5-44c49bd51496-original.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Clearly, I must be important enough to let in, right?</p>
<p>Currently, there are 152 coins and 269 currency pairs trading on Korea&#x2019;s largest cryptoassets exchange by volume. But due to a <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/958469/South-Korea-crypto-exchange-Upbit-raided-police" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police scare</a> way back in early May, new users have perhaps been a bit gun shy about onboarding to the platform. There certainly were very few people there on the recent rainy day that I visited.</p>
<p>But that&#x2019;s all about to change!</p>
<p>UpBit was <a href="https://www.ccn.com/koreas-biggest-crypto-exchange-upbit-comes-out-clean-in-audit-after-raid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleared of any wrongdoings</a> by a police investigation earlier this month.</p>
<p>And Bithumb just <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/08/31/koreas-major-crypto-exchange-bithumb-resumes-registration-partners-with-nh-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it will finally allow new users to start opening accounts again TODAY on September 1. To quote from the NewsBTC article linked to above, &#x201C;Considering that Bithumb and other leading cryptocurrency exchanges have not been able to facilitate new users since January, local analysts predict that a new wave of capital will hit the Korean markets.&#x201D; In addition, Bithumb just <a href="https://cryptovest.com/news/bithumb-lists-waltonchain-wtc-iot-chain-itc-fuels-strong-price-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> they will be starting trade in two new fiat pairs for the altcoins Waltonchain (WTC) and IOT Chain (ITC). Having direct fiat onramps for these kind of esoteric coins is just nuts to me.</p>
<p>But, hey, it&#x2019;s Korea!</p>
<p>Close to half of salaried workers in Korea invest in crypto. And that doesn&#x2019;t even count the retirees who have also caught the crypto bug. That&#x2019;s the <a href="https://www.cryptoambit.com/blog/2018/1/21/south-korea-and-the-crypto-craze" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistic you hear bandied about</a> so often in the Hashed offices in Gangnam District. Yes, Gangnam of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 billion-plus YouTube views</a>, that Gangnam!</p>
<p>Just think about how crazy that stat is. South Korea represents about 0.5% of world population and more than 30% of international cryptocurrency trading volume. And they&#x2019;ve been blocked from registering new accounts during the entire year of 2018.</p>
<p>Just check out how awesome the displays are here in these Gangnam walk-in centers:</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>We all do stupid things in life.</p>
<p>It just stings a little bit more when we do stupid things with our own personal finance.</p>
<p>Since &#x201C;those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it,&#x201D; it&#x2019;s always nice when someone is brave enough to come out and say, &#x201C;Hey, look, I messed up. I&#x2019;m gonna tell you about it so maybe you won&#x2019;t make the same mistakes I did.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Thus, I recently read about the sad story of one <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/investing/investor-takes-out-127000-loan-to-buy-cryptocurrency-loses-85-per-cent/news-story/7806e7acca0eec8a282f9d83f1d8d07b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cryptohomie</a>, a 32-year-old from Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>He borrowed a $126,500 personal loan from a UAE bank, which is apparently a simple thing to do in the land of oil wealth. That&#x2019;s kind of a staggering amount that one can so easily obtain, but that&#x2019;s not the point of this life lesson. What we want to know is&#x2026;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>To buy cryptocurrency. &#x1F928;</p>
<p>And don&#x2019;t get me wrong! I loves me some crypto and blockchain investments. I have made (and lost) a bunch of money doing this type of investing. Being that this is steemit powered by STEEM and we are living through the Crypto Dog Days of Summer 2018, I&#x2019;m sure that a lot of you, too, are in the same boat. Waiting for the next bull&#x2026; or whatever. And god knows really when and/or if it will ever happen.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The night is always darkest just before the dawn.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s the usual drill. We&#x2019;ll see if that happens again. I have a feeling that it will. But I have NO IDEA what will happen in the short run.</p>
<p>But let&#x2019;s get this straight, first and foremost, right here and now, young crypto Padawans&#x2026;</p>
<p>Never ever never ever ever borrow money to invest in crypto.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s just stupid.</p>
<p>Sure, maybe a little bit of light margin on a stock account. No more than 20%. That can be okay. At times. Like if you know you&#x2019;re gonna get paid in the next few weeks and you see an opportunity that simply is just too juicy to pass up. But realize that it is still RISKY AF.</p>
<p>But borrowing to buy cryptoassets?</p>
<p>NO!</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s just nuts.</p>
<p>The asset class is simply way too young and volatile to even be thinking about this kind of investment strategy.</p>
<p>But yet, I know some people who are absolutely addicted to BitMEX and its leveraged bitcoin trading environment. In fact, I&#x2019;ve even been in WeChat groups where people advocate leveraging short and long positions because &#x201C;there&#x2019;s just no other way to make money right now.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You gone get REKT!</p>
<p>So remember <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/96qvxb/here_is_my_bank_instalment_related_to_the_loan_i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this lesson</a> whenever you invest:</p>
<p>Don&#x2019;t be like Cryptohomie, y&#x2019;all!</p>

            <p>Probably one of the best and most needed applications of blockchain technology is using it for voting.</p>
<p>A lot of people outside the US may not realize that American elections have been largely based on electronic voting machines ever since the 2000 election. If there were such a thing is an internet meme back then, &#x201C;hanging chads in Florida&#x201D; would have definitely made national headlines.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s revisit this ridiculous piece of American history. Imgur is waiting for your contributions!</p>

<p>And for the win, my absolute favorite:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmaohkP6BpdtxHYJ7XkfUQpeyj6NbQW98pT8Hq1nRLqcFX/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Meme away, Internet! Hopefully someone somewhere out there reads my posts and we&#x2019;ll get some nice work from the meme mines to spread about during the upcoming Trump-dominated mid-term election cycle.</p>
<p>For those of you under 30, let me explain to you what a &#x201C;hanging chad&#x201D; is exactly. Before we used computers to automatically tabulate election results according to the data blindly entered into a private database controlled by a few poorly paid election officials, each voter used to fill out their voting preferences on an actual piece of paper. To automate this tedious process, we invented paper with a pre-cut dimple that voters were supposed to fully detach from the whole piece of paper in order to indicate their vote. Tabulation machines were then created that could be fed stacks and stacks of voting paper at a time to deliver election results quickly.</p>
<p>A &#x201C;hanging chad&#x201D; looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmWsohagMgrZoWFQkL6pFMLM9J79TcdfgnqLe6pomsDoMq/image.png" alt=""> </p>
<p>As you can see, it is literally impossible to tell the true intent of the voter. Did this chad become hanging due to the voter pressing it in? Or did it get caught up in the tabulating machinery and detach all by itself?</p>
<p>This pedantic debate basically gave us George W. Bush. Weird, right? I know.</p>
<p>In an effort to avoid this particularly weird debate in the subsequent 2004 presidential election, the US turned to digital voting machines to execute the election. However, as is often the case, solving one problem usually just leads to a host of new problems.</p>
<p>Sure enough, with the not-as-close-but-still-pretty-close Bush v. Kerry presidential election came claims of digital ballot box stuffing, particularly in &#x201C;purple&#x201D; regions where the results were close enough that an extra 10,000 votes here or there striped into the protocol via programming &#x201C;back doors&#x201D; could swing an entire election. Such claims of corruption have persisted from both Democrats and Republicans to this day.</p>
<p>Blockchain and crypto is the solution for ending this kind of corruption.</p>
<p><a href="https://nem.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NEM</a> &amp; innovative projects like <a href="https://www.agora.vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agora</a> are working on exactly that.</p>
<p>NEM is a 3rd-generation blockchain that is focused on creating usable enterprise solutions. For instance, my company, <a href="https://darcmatter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DarcMatter</a>, plans to utilize the hybrid public/private nature of their technology to better serve our customers. However, NEM has recently been focusing on the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-electoral-commission-uses-nem-blockchain-for-voting-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting use case</a>, having recently partnered with the Ukrainian government to help make democratic elections in that Eastern European nation more transparent and secure.</p>
<p>Agora.vote is a fantastic Ethereum-based project that will hopefully help us secure democracy for the next generation. They have already assisted with an election in Africa and have recently come to <a href="https://paymentweek.com/2018-8-13-diginex-partners-agora-provide-blockchain-based-voting-asia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an agreement with Diginex</a> to provide voting systems in Asia. According to their website, blockchain-based voting is &#x201C;tamper-proof, private, accessible, affordable, and tension-less.&#x201D;</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s the way elections should be.</p>
<p>Thanks, blockchain!</p>
<p>You&#x2019;re the best. &#x1F60D;</p>
