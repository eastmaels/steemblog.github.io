        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Simply put, buying a car for $200,000 or more is a big waste of money.</p>
<p>Might as well do this:</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmRFewtBFGzbgvjNQ4xn6Uw2Q6X38kjv3pfoAmWWiRUHZ9/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To me, in order to buy a Lamborghini, or any other type of high-performance luxury vehicle, your salary would have to be SO BIG that spending $200,000 should feel like most of us taking our spouses out to a high-class dinner at a Michelin restaurant.</p>
<p>Feel free to call me crazy, but that would be my criteria for deciding how big a salary I would need in order to justify buying such a car.</p>
<p>So what do I mean by that? </p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s see&#x2026; I can calculate the relative cost of purchasing such a car and then compare that to a minimally middle-class income. So bear with me while I write on the back of the envelope here&#x2026;</p>
<p>A really nice dinner can set you back about $300&#x2026; which is about 10% of the monthly disposable income of the lowest tier of middle-class folks&#x2026; To determine what your annual salary would need to be&#x2026; IMHO&#x2026; to buy such a car&#x2026;</p>
<p>You would simply multiply $200,000<em>10</em>12&#x2026; for a total of&#x2026;</p>
<p>$24 million per year.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know it sounds crazy&#x2026; At least we&#x2019;re talking pre-tax income here. That&#x2019;s gross income before taxes.</p>
<p>But this is just my opinion. Let me explain.</p>
<p>The fact is that you really only just need to go from one place to another. And today, there are just so many affordable, safe, clean, and more environmentally friendly options to get people from A to B and back again. There&#x2019;s public transportation, Didi/Uber, Mobike/ofo, walking, taking your own bike, those crazy motorized personal transport things, etc. In some cities even, you really don&#x2019;t even need to have a car. They&#x2019;re more trouble than their worth.</p>
<p>IN SOME CITIES, even, the economic costs of owning a car, in the long run, FARRRR outstrip the costs associated with simply purchasing that car.</p>
<p>Let me list the economic costs associated with car ownership right here:</p>
<ul>
<li>A parking space to store your car while you&#x2019;re at home.</li>
<li>Parking fees to park your car while you&#x2019;re out and about town.</li>
<li>Insurance.</li>
<li>Fuel.</li>
<li>License plate fees, which in cities like Shanghai can far exceed $10,000!</li>
<li>Maintenance costs.</li>
<li>Don&#x2019;t forget to include the value of all the personal time you have to spend managing this declining-value asset!</li>
</ul>
<p>If I left any reason out please let me know in the comments below. &#x1F447;&#x1F447;&#x1F447;</p>
<p>To me, when you add up all of these costs, they are such an onerous burden that it just doesn&#x2019;t make any economic sense to own any car, much less a luxury vehicle like a Lamborghini.</p>
<p>Especially in big cities with well-developed public transportation and plenty of amenities nearby, all of these expenses combined outweigh the usefulness of the asset. So maximizing the economic utility of car ownership happens with a car that costs somewhere between $10,000 and $30,000.</p>
<p>Anything beyond that is really just a waste of money.</p>
<p>Instead, I prefer to buy stocks, companies, houses, and crypto for my investment portfolio.</p>
<p>These are all assets that actually have a chance of going up in value.</p>
<p>Disagree? Let me know! We can have a spirited debate.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I&#x2019;ve recently had the distinct pleasure of becoming a father. So far it&#x2019;s been an amazing experience. But one element I keep coming back to that I think all fathers must struggle with at some point or another is,</p>
<p>HOW THE FUCK AM I GONNA PAY FOR THIS CHILD?</p>
<p>It forces you to make some tough decisions. Like chasing the startup dream for innumerable years&#x2026; Once you have a beautiful daughter staring back at with you big brown eyes and her future life is literally hanging on every action you make, it starts to make you think critically about your existence.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmd6ETLmzfpL5R3A2vbSeFmDhyds6wbJ9PZBAG1g4qFZE4/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Suddenly, working for free no longer sounds so romantic. I know, I know, WE ARE GOING TO THE MOON! That&#x2019;s what they say in cryptoland. For non-blockchain enthusiasts, the entrepreneurs I know have their eyes set on merely a seaside bungaloo somewhere in Southeast Asia. It&#x2019;s kinda like, &#x201C;Hey y&#x2019;all, get get get it! But I gotta hang back here and work overtime (for money!) to pay for the nanny and save up for her ever-ballooning education costs.</p>
<p>And that never hits home harder than when your baby turns into a living, breathing, walking, shitting, babbling nonsense toddler-creature that at times seems like it has come straight from the depths of hell and at other times seems like the world&#x2019;s most perfect calm angel. For me, it was almost like, &#x201C;Whoa, where did this girl come from? That was fast.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmeSxBzNQ5d5qtchQvfdnPj52LaEqWSX2mYwRTFg5msHjB/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Yeah, before you become a parent, you hear people say all the time - THEY GROW UP FAST - and sure, you&#x2019;re like, of course they do! They&#x2019;re humans. But you don&#x2019;t really know what that means till it actually happens to you.</p>
<p>As a finance professor, of course my little spreadsheet-and-charts oriented mind turns to what comes easiest to me - the calculation of the need for money. I&#x2019;m hoping mom and grandma can sort out my little monster or at least tell me what I need to do in that regard. But I&#x2019;m already thinking about how I can instill in my little girl all the financial traits that I would like her to utilize for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>There are four main areas of personal finance that kids need to learn about. The means for teaching kids these four aspects depends on the type of children you have. But let&#x2019;s keep it simple for now. As parents, we need to teach them how to earn, save, budget, and invest.</p>
<p><strong>1. Earning</strong></p>
<p>I strongly believe in kids working part-time jobs when they are young. At first, parents may have to seek these opportunities out for them, but  eventually, children will figure out the most suitable activities for themselves. Selling lemonade. Flyering. Lawnmowing. Babysitting. Tutoring. Online entrepreneurialism. Who knows what the future will be like? But I hope to have my girl thinking about her piggy bank from just about the time she starts asking me for money.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmRQXR1jJKPDs2hQKkbezX4vpiV2dhDjfbFSDCzA2ihcAD/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>2. Saving</strong></p>
<p>For saving, I plan to incentivize her by matching her savings 401-k style. Something like, &#x201C;I will give you 50% more of what you save, but the money that goes in that account does not come out unless we as a family agree that the purchase is worth your savings.&#x201D; That means that that money is not going to be spent on the latest fad or toy. Or ice cream and sandwiches with her friends. I&#x2019;ma make her write an essay justifying her purchase every time she wants to pull money out of that account.</p>
<p><strong>3. Budgeting</strong></p>
<p>I really like the idea my mom has about this, even though of course I hated it growing up. Do not bail out your kids! Not for sales taxes. Not for lunch money. Not for bouts of pitifulness. If they don&#x2019;t have enough money, then they can&#x2019;t buy it. If they spent the money on something else, then they can&#x2019;t buy the thing they think they want. Let them learn about  the tradeoffs that are associated with purchases of consumer goods. No one needs everything.</p>
<p><strong>4. Investing</strong></p>
<p>I have already opened a Coverdell Education Savings Account (this applies to Americans only), which is basically like a tax-free investing account that can only be spent on education expenses. Every year, I pick one stock and I put the maximum contribution of $2000 towards it. When my girl gets older, I hope that she will get actively involved with that selection. That&#x2019;ll be her stock!</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmRGEbTyuRZHt7uwqqTb8TpPhUy3LhMaTT9Cv5rRci9oBL/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When I was a kid, I was lucky enough to have a dad who let me pick two stocks for myself all by my lonesome. I picked 100 shares of Marvel Comics and 100 shares of Topps Baseball Cards. One did spectacularly well, the other&#x2026; not so much. By the time Marvel had split three times and gone up a couple hundred percent, I was addicted to checking the ticker page in the business section of the newspaper everyday. At that point, I became an investor. And I have never looked back!</p>
<p>Lastly, when they are old enough (maybe 10, maybe 12, it really depends on their interests) I will establish a Uniform Gift to Minors Account (UGMA). I will stick the money into something safe, like an index fund, balanced mutual fund, or municipal bond fund, something that pays a healthy and regular dividend. I&#x2019;ll show them the statements every month and say, &#x201C;You see, we didn&#x2019;t do anything at all and look at how our money is increasing every single month. This is called compounding!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Like Albert Einstein once said, COMPOUND INTEREST IS THE GREATEST INVENTION THE WORLD EVER PRODUCED.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s never too early to teach your children that lesson.</p>

            <p>I am stupidly excited to get to this milestone&#x2026; AGAIN.</p>
<p>Way more excited than I was the last time this happened.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because last time BTC reaching ten thousand dollars seemed inevitable. After the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) FUD body-slammed BTC back into the $5,500-$6,500 range somewhere around November 15, it literally went straight up.</p>
<p>Every day.</p>
<p>Sometimes a couple thousand dollars in a day.</p>
<p>That can&#x2019;t last. It&#x2019;s simply not sustainable.</p>
<p>But to see it crash land and bounce like a red kickball off those exact same levels (a.k.a. around $6,000) during the sustained crash from mid-January to early February&#x2026; That shows some moxy!</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmViWPRpVtdNucvNTk34G6wtpasPiUBoLsrHMMfDABcivv/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At the time of writing, we are at around a $475 billion market cap for global crypto, which is about 70% off the lows we saw less than 2 weeks ago.</p>
<p>For typically long-term investors like myself, I&#x2019;m just not used to seeing this kind of action. But also, as a long-term investor, I know that the intermediate stops along the way are just for scenery and don&#x2019;t matter all that much.</p>
<p>This is a bubble in the making for sure, but we have in no way seen the top.</p>
<p>And I think this superb resiliency has proven it.</p>
<p>For all the doubters out there, and hey I know, a $500 billion drop in market cap is a scary thing to watch. Sure, I was a little disappointed to see my portfolio go from 6x to 2x, too&#x2026; Who wouldn&#x2019;t?</p>
<p>But I was never really worried. Why? I have a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>#1) <strong>Fibonacci</strong> - I knew one of the support levels would hold. It turned out to be $280 billion, which just so happens to be a nearly perfect 61.8% Fibonacci retracement. Fibonnaci&#x2019;s my dude now. Maybe I&#x2019;ll wrote more about him in a later post.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmazyQQhwuG98xzXpbjqysFymywueHJPy1sL6M8Toaoc9T/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>#2) <strong>Chinese New Year</strong> - I am married to China. I love the place. But darn it if you can&#x2019;t get anything done in the two weeks leading up to the lunar new year, which occurs sometime in January or February every year. It&#x2019;s happening right now. People are home and bored af in their hometown. So we&#x2019;re seeing volume pick up. But you don&#x2019;t have to take my anecdotal evidence. Why would you? Take a look at this <a href="https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@budz82/coincidence-multi-year-bitcoin-crash-pattern-like-clockwork-btc-has-crashed-25-35-for-4-years-in-a-row-23-24-days-before-chinese" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> from @budz82 It&#x2019;s great. When you click on over, you&#x2019;ll see that EVERY SINGLE YEAR FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS, the market has taken a dive starting about three-and-a-half weeks before the Chinese New Year. I had confidence that this year would be no different.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQme5Mz5MvzQ4qCZa8Ht2zFx8yEzLPnx8949AX2tyJEfDsf/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>#3) <strong>Portfolio Diversification</strong> - I don&#x2019;t have all my money in crypto. I manage a balanced portfolio of uncorrelated assets. That means that when one thing zigs, the others zag. And vice versa. In the long run, this is a proven strategy to build wealth and sleep easy at night. I talk about this over at my blog <a href="http://www.lowbetaportfolio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LowBetaPortfolio.com</a>. It&#x2019;s not easy and it takes some time to master your emotions for sure. But anyone who invests for long-term goals (housing, education, retirement, health care) has got to think this way.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmYBfrb5SWanNMgDMVJeD9EcdkJeG8qo861eacyo2p4wxw/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We are now less than $100 away. The excitement is real. People are incessantly shooting off fireworks outside. They must be excited about BTC10K, too!</p>
<p>Oh wait, those are just my wife&#x2019;s neighbors going a little bit nuts for Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>Like they always do.</p>
<p>Happy Chinese New Year everyone! Enjoy the GAINZ!</p>

        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Well, I hate to say &#x201C;I told you so.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But, oh, nevermind&#x2026;</p>
<p>I TOLD YOU SO.</p>
<p>Right here: <a href="https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@shanghaipreneur/undervalued-coin-watch-oyster-prl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@shanghaipreneur/undervalued-coin-watch-oyster-prl</a></p>
<p>The Oyster Protocol &#x201C;could be&#x201D; the solution to everything that plagues the internet. Or it could just be another failed project. Whatever happens on that front, PRL is most certainly an undervalued coin in the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p>Take a look at this hourly blow-by-blow from February 8th through 11th:<br><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmR4dPLg4FcNWQrXpwf6aEYitcbGWL55D4XitfXEMVdh5m/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At its peak, that was something like a 90% move in a day. This action is what small cap coins are all about. Now when you combine a small cap coin and news, actual real bullish-as-fuck news, not just some fluff come up with by the PR firm you hired, you get price movement backed by SIGNIFICANT VOLUME.</p>
<p>On my CMC screen, I&#x2019;m looking at $6 million in trades executed in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmY9NXQ4Yk898RxnxGfEGY75EzHMStasFmwtBCx2gPJs2e/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That&#x2019;s A LOT for a small cap coin like PRL. So obviously the next question any &#x201C;rational&#x201D; investor should ask (and let&#x2019;s face it - does ANYONE know ANYBODY that is in fact &#x201C;rational&#x201D;? I&#x2019;m still looking&#x2026;) is</p>
<p>WHY?</p>
<p>Why did this little useless ERC-20 token spike in price so much in just one day? And why is Shanghaipreneur wasting his Sunday morning coffee to tell Steemit about it?</p>
<p>Fair points, for sure. I like coffee and mine is getting cold af from spending too much time writing this post.</p>
<p>Here are the 2 reasons that I have been able to discern so far.</p>
<p>1) COIN BURN</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/oysterprotocol/oyster-pearl-team-update-4-f2cc22eca1a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://medium.com/oysterprotocol/oyster-pearl-team-update-4-f2cc22eca1a7</a></p>
<p>The coin burn is the new method for &#x201C;little coins that could&#x201D; to regenerate interest in people trading them. It is a logic based on the most basic of economic principles. When you decrease supply, assuming that demand stays constant, the price of an asset MUST correct upwards to reflect its new status as a more &#x201C;rare&#x201D; asset. But beware that caveat &#x201C;if demand stays constant,&#x201D; which is not always guaranteed.</p>
<p>Lots of coins are doing this, or contemplating this, right now. Perhaps bot favorite Tron (TRX) is the most famous coin thinking about using this tactic. As a result, some crazy Youtubers are calling for TRX to go to $15.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s nonsense.</p>
<p>To me, coin burns are all just semantics. Having too many coins is a sign that there is less demand for your coin than you thought there would be. And highlighting that fact does not seem to me to be the most prudent thing to do for your coin&#x2019;s value in the long run. But hey, coin burns are working, and we are in a market where anything is on the table. Whatever works&#x2026; right?</p>
<p>But this coin burn announcement was on February 2 and the &#x201C;moon&#x201D; didn&#x2019;t happen until February 10, eight days later. But the crypto markets were in a freeze and it&#x2019;s understandable that &#x201C;risk-on&#x201D; trades like undervalued small caps might get swept under the rug until the next market upturn. So I&#x2019;m willing to give this factor a 20% weight as to the reason for Oyster&#x2019;s huge move yesterday.</p>
<p>But the primary factor for yesterday&#x2019;s &#x201C;moon&#x201D; is&#x2026;</p>
<p>2) AIRDROP!!!!</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/oysterprotocol/dawn-of-a-new-era-3ca2e2f5a1c6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://medium.com/oysterprotocol/dawn-of-a-new-era-3ca2e2f5a1c6</a></p>
<p>Airdrops are another new favorite strategy for coins in 2018. This post by the anonymous leader of Oyster, Bruno Block, had the most to do with yesterday&#x2019;s huge move upwards. Titled &#x201C;Dawn of a New Era,&#x201D; it&#x2019;s short and to the point.</p>
<p>He concisely and precisely points the reader to where he is trying to pilot this project:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oyster is a revolutionary protocol that resets the assumptions of the current internet paradigm and addresses the aforementioned issues [the internet being constantly threatened by governing bodies worldwide concerning censorship, regulation, and spying a part of which has resulted in the net neutrality fiasco in the US] with a new comprehensive platform.&#x201D;</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s a mouthful.</p>
<p>And whether or not Block can pull it off is yet to be seen. But at least now we know why he/she has kept himself anonymous up to this point in the development of the project. Previously, the naysayers have used the project leader&#x2019;s anonymity to deride the project. But read that quote above and start counting how many mega-cap companies, and of course the politicians that they lobby, that will be disrupted with this technology. Just off the top of my head&#x2026; Verizon, AT&amp;T, Comcast, Netflix, Google, Facebook&#x2026; That&#x2019;s trillions of dollars at stake here with this potential technology. So hopefully you understand Block&#x2019;s caution a little better. Plus, Satoshi&#x2019;s anonymity hasn&#x2019;t stopped Bitcoin from being worth a hundred billion dollars so I struggle to understand the critique.</p>
<p>We are talking about one of the most fascinating, and achievable, use cases for cryptocurrencies - the equitable and sustainable monetization of media.</p>
<p>Now, how is Block going to achieve this disruption?</p>
<p>Well, with yet another coin, of course.</p>
<p>Oyster (PRL) will soon airdrop to all PRL holders (or HODLers as is the current industry jargon) a new coin appropriately called Shell (SHL). The reason for this split is not entirely clear to me, but it has something to do with fairly compensating content creators (the ones that actually make the media) and media distribution arms (the ones that pay for the infrastructure to deliver the media). Here&#x2019;s what Block has to say about Shells:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Today I am introducing Oyster Shell (SHL). Shells are used to pay for connectivity and Dapp operation across the Oyster meshnet, whilst Pearls are used for static data retention on the tangle. Shell is not pegged to storage like how Pearl is. In the future you will be able to use Shells to access the decentralized web, connectivity that entirely bypasses ISPs and centralized infrastructure.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Seriously, that&#x2019;s revolutionary!</p>
<p>At a current market cap of just about $70 million (as of writing), Oyster (PRL) is still on my Undervalued Coin Watch List. On the list of altcoins liable to make the leap to $1 billion market cap, Bruno Block and his team are pretty far up there. If that happened, we&#x2019;d be talking about a 14x move from here.</p>
<p>Block has said as much in his previous Medium posts. Work through the calculations in this post,<br><a href="https://medium.com/oysterprotocol/how-prl-pricing-will-work-in-the-future-d67c4f231386" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://medium.com/oysterprotocol/how-prl-pricing-will-work-in-the-future-d67c4f231386</a></p>
<p>And you will find that Block thinks the PRL coin should eventually be worth $15, which is about 14x from here.</p>
<p>Great minds think alike?</p>
<hr>
<p>Anyways, please note this is not financial advice and I&#x2019;m totally biased because I own some of this coin and my daughter&#x2019;s name is Pearl. So I mean, DYOR but feel free to follow me or ask any questions below. I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll be talking about Oyster Protocol soon enough.</p>

<p>Da Hongfei Speech at NEO DevCon sets the bar for the NEO blockchain even higher. Since rebranding his not-for-profit organization&#x2019;s product from AntShares to NEO just over half a year ago, the governing token of the NEO Foundation&#x2019;s public blockchain, known famously by its trading ticker NEO, has exploded in value.</p>
<p>I had seen the Chinese media on WeChat about this speech given in San Francisco on February 2, 2018 and it had looked pretty spectacular. Flashy color-coordinated signs. Fancy new English slogans. Stuff about NEX - supposedly the world&#x2019;s first &#x201C;perfect&#x201D; decentralized exchange. But let&#x2019;s face it. It was all in Chinese. I&#x2019;m lazy.</p>
<p>And Chinese is hard. So even though there might be some cryptomarket shattering news buried somewhere in the sinewy characters, I&#x2019;m just gonna wait for the English press to get their hands on it and let me know what&#x2019;s up.</p>
<p>And that finally happened today! Six days later on Coin Central. <a href="https://coincentral.com/neo-new-vision-moonshot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://coincentral.com/neo-new-vision-moonshot/</a></p>
<p>As an industry, we have to do a better job at doing timely, responsible reporting. But hey, it&#x2019;s a fledgling young industry. It&#x2019;ll get figured out. There&#x2019;ll probably be an ICO for it. There&#x2019;s more than a fighting chance that it&#x2019;ll end up being STEEM.</p>
<p>Anyways, Da Hongfei&#x2019;s aspirations are certainly lunar in nature. With direct references to JFK&#x2019;s famous &#x201C;moon speech&#x201D; and the goal &#x201C;to make NEO the No.1 blockchain by 2020&#x201D; certainly support the new branding.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<p>NEO: The Moonshot.</p>
<p>The New Vision.</p>
<p>I mean it&#x2019;s quite the rhetoric. The rapidity with which Da has learned to carry himself over the past year is certainly remarkable. A speech delivered with poise and humor had more than 500 audience members rapt bathing in the ubiquitous neon-green glow of NEO. He is truly becoming a visionary leader (and losing some weight!) and that bodes a prosperous future for the NEO coin and its stakeholders.</p>
