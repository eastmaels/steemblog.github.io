            <p>Coming mostly from a background in traditional finance, when I first heard about transaction mining I was astounded. My initial reaction was basically RUFKM?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmfWUbvWGQJcbnhjv9cubNKU2Ve9BJRya9gbiAVp12YjJP/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Some images in this post, including the one above, come from <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/transaction-fee-mining-exchanges-highly-popular-highly-controversial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Bitcoin.com article</a>, which does a good job summarizing the negative view on transaction mining. Some people call it trans-fee mining.</p>
<p>After a bit of thinking, I started talking about it with our team. Our company Slack at <a href="https://konstellation.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Konstellation</a> was peppered with questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>So you mean tokenholders get paid for trading?</li>
<li>Uh, how does the exchange make any money?</li>
<li>How does this free token you get for trading retain any value?</li>
<li>Are you sure that&#x2019;s even legal?</li>
</ul>
<p>To say the least, we were skeptical, as were many in the blockchain industry. But, as with a lot of new and unfamiliar ideas we&#x2019;ve encountered on our <a href="https://medium.com/@KONSTELLATION/konstellation-announces-official-launch-as-leading-global-blockchain-solutions-provider-for-62595f9454aa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interstellar journey</a> across the cryptoverse (Hey man, my company is named Konstellation, so I get to be liberal with the star-related puns!), engaging with this community and the game-changing technology of blockchain, you have to be willing to change your tune.</p>
<p>That doesn&#x2019;t mean that I think every exchange that uses transaction mining is doing it in a legit fashion. It just means that I don&#x2019;t think transaction mining is as bad as I thought it was when I first encountered it. The world and its financial ecosystem are changing so fast that new paradigms become old ones and old frameworks get rendered obsolete, all in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/press-releases/a-new-era-of-transaction-mining-is-coming-and-who-will-be-the-winner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fcoin began the transaction mining movement</a> in June 2018. It was a major disruption for the crypto markets. As such, the existing crypto market institutions derided it primarily because it was a threat to newly established crypto players, which had themselves displaced previous exchange powerhouses like Bobby Lee&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.btcc.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTCC</a>. I don&#x2019;t know who owns BTCC any more but I know good ol&#x2019; Bobby is long gone. Whoever owns BTCC now can&#x2019;t even spell.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbZyhJm3qogk74wYBZXTkFdjBN12RewMwHiMqtKePkf5p/Screen%20Shot%202019-03-17%20at%2011.19.38%20AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-03-17 at 11.19.38 AM.png"></p>
<p>Nice plateform, guys!</p>
<p>At its height, Fcoin saw <strong>$17 billion of trading volume in one day</strong>. That&#x2019;s what happens when people not only can trade for free, but get paid for doing it, too!</p>
<p>Innovation is almost universally met with resistance. Moreover, it is the first movers that often get tossed aside once the new business model has been refined and accepted by the masses. Does anyone still use Friendster or <a href="https://myspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Myspace</a>?</p>
<p>It turned out that the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-death-of-fcoin-a-tale-of-bad-token-design-261d64a8116f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">token economy of Fcoin was an extremely poor design</a>. There was absolutely no incentive for holding the native FT token on the Fcoin exchange. The result was disaster for anyone who decided to hold the FT tokens they had acquired for free.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmV1qdB6UAh4bPnYtzwhe72Sdggp6fi2etGfzJczTb8BVp/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Other exchanges that quickly adopted this model were <a href="https://www.bitforex.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitforex</a>, <a href="http://coinbene.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbene</a>, <a href="https://www.coinsuper.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinsuper</a>, and <a href="https://bgogo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bgogo</a>. Boy, just clicking through those links you&#x2019;ll notice one overarching theme. These <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/chainup#section-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chainup</a> guys must be rich! Since most modern crypto-to-crypto exchanges originate from the same white label exchange service provider, the only distinguishing characteristic that differentiates these products is the token economics behind the native exchange token on each of these &#x201C;3rd generation&#x201D; exchanges.</p>
<p>As somewhat of a regulatory nerd myself, I eventually came to realize that the true innovation in transaction mining is that it allows for the wide distribution of tokens without passing the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/328/293/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howey test</a>.</p>
<p>What is the Howey test? Despite what you may have heard, it is the ONLY method by which regulators can determine whether or not an &#x201C;investment contract&#x201D; is indeed a security. The test is derived from Supreme Court case law and was issued in the landmark case <em>SEC v. Howey Co.</em> on May 27, 1946. It still is the main determinant of what is and is not a security in the United States today.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmfR8xJjfAGj62iGU6VnKaUCV5xE2p3PdHqNRRQJUuiHhm/Screen%20Shot%202019-03-17%20at%2012.13.12%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-03-17 at 12.13.12 PM.png"></p>
<p>The so-called &#x201C;test&#x201D; looks at four factors. These four aspects must ALL be met in order for an asset to be considered a security according to US law:</p>
<ol>
<li>An investment of money&#x2026;</li>
<li>in a common enterprise&#x2026;</li>
<li>with an expectation of profits&#x2026;</li>
<li>to come solely from the <strong>efforts of others</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The case goes on to state that &#x201C;if that test be satisfied, it is immaterial whether the enterprise is speculative or nonspeculative, or whether there is a sale of property with or without intrinsic value.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Once one properly understands the parameters of the Howey Test, one can see the beauty of the trans-fee mining model. While the first 3 conditions of the Howey model are easily satisfied, the 4th condition is avoided when token holders must ACTIVELY do something to acquire the token. In this instance, for crypto exchanges at least, tokens are acquired via trading, thereby ensuring that native exchange tokens (from exchanges that utilize this business model) can never pass the Howey Test. Therefore, such tokens can never be considered a security.</p>
<p>The first exchange to really advance this thinking in token economic design is <a href="https://bitmax.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitmax</a>. They have employed what I call the &#x201C;kitchen sink approach&#x201D; to token economics. Not only do they use transaction mining on select pairs, right now it is only offered on two stablecoin pairs, they also have developed a unique &#x201C;reverse mining&#x201D; approach for all other pairs. This innovation means that they don&#x2019;t have to dilute the BTMX native token by compensating traders with it on every trade. They just return the trading fee to you in a main coin like ETH and deduct the equivalent from your BTMX balance. This combination creates a two-way trade for BTMX tokens, rather than the one-way down down down that plagued FT tokens on Fcoin.</p>
<p>In addition to these two methods of &#x201C;mining&#x201D; BTMX, Bitmax offers a ridiculously high &#x201C;dividend&#x201D; for those token holders that lock their BTMX up on the trading platform. Note the air quotes around &#x201C;dividend&#x201D; please. Because Ariel and George, the finance industry veterans who founded Bitmax, are not stupid enough to actually call it that. Instead they use the term &#x201C;Data Usage Reward.&#x201D; By ACTIVELY allowing them to use your trading data (for what, no one knows) they avoid the designation of security according to the Howey Test.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s a smart way to go about it.</p>
<p>There is, however, one flaw in their model. And it is this flaw that makes me certain that we have not seen the end of &#x201C;liquidity innovation&#x201D; on crypto-to-crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>For the longest time, the &#x201C;data usage reward&#x201D; had been unreasonably high. The annual percentage rate (APR) given to BTMX token holders that locked up their tokens on the platform was between 70% and 100%. In order to bring this number down to more reasonable levels, the BTMX token price had to be pumped. Remember, as price increases, yield decreases. As of today, the APR is now a much more reasonable 33.3667%.</p>
<p>However, in order to achieve this much more reasonable yield, they now have to have 3-4x more volume on the two stablecoin pairs (USDC/USDT and PAX/USDT) in which you can conduct trans-fee mining. That is just what has to happen in order for the exchange to maintain the previous pre-pump inflation rate of the BTMX token supply. This inevitable truth leads to some pretty ridiculous looking charts:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZtDU5ZT9sGwXbok2ue8e1WrZHh42uPW5XP8CjuQtjFGW/Screen%20Shot%202019-03-13%20at%205.58.42%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-03-13 at 5.58.42 PM.png"></p>
<p>Remember that is a stablecoin pair you are looking at!</p>
<p>$1=$1, right? Not on Bitmax.</p>
<p>So this token design has led to some rather unbelievable volume numbers since the initial pump in BTMX price. Let&#x2019;s take a look at today&#x2019;s top 10 exchanges according to reported volume on CMC:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmaAnMo8cxxnULiYnpWgKzJMstRUkUaTN6NDsbENsQj7ow/Screen%20Shot%202019-03-17%20at%2012.48.39%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-03-17 at 12.48.39 PM.png"></p>
<p>So Bitmax ends up being the #1 exchange according to reported volume, even though it is the #49 exchange when it comes to adjusted volume. That&#x2019;s because 99.32% of their volume is recorded in the two stablecoin pairs that allow transaction mining of the BTMX token.</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t know about you but I find it extremely unlikely that there is $7.29 billion worth of capital out there willing to chase bips on the limited volatility in stablecoin pairs on an exchange most people have never heard of.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I can&#x2019;t wait to see what the next iteration of the trans-fee mining model will bring. Transaction mining is a good idea that has yet to come into full flower.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Did you see what BlockFi is doing with 6.2% interest? Love that.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hey, did you hear you can get 6+% interest on your crypto in crypto?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What is this about a bitcoin savings account? DAYUM.&#x201D;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Initially, I was like, &#x201C;Meh, sounds good, I guess. I&#x2019;ll check it out in a bit.&#x201D; And then I did! And take a looky here:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmXe42KpUquM2ZG69SyXiUDqXRzPweYb6QwfSp57zyCrkw/Screen%20Shot%202019-03-06%20at%2011.06.18%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-03-06 at 11.06.18 PM.png"></p>
<p>That&#x2019;s a real, live website. I honestly think I&#x2019;ll be sending my Coinbase stash over to BlockFi this weekend.</p>
<p>Custody is by Gemini, the exchange started by those annoying twins portrayed in The Social Network. I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;re not like that in real life.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmSk8rB6jzvh8icWSd2xGHtjWX75umiAGUpNzqrX9VGGLf/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But Gemini is a pretty stand-up name in the cryptosphere and backers of one of the better stablecoins out there - GUSD.</p>
<p>So it makes sense, right? Deep down, I&#x2019;m just a blind HODLer, right?</p>
<p>I thought so, but then I read an old Chicago trader&#x2019;s post about the news where he trotted out the old &#x201C;High yield means high risk&#x201D; line&#x2026; to which you would think most blockchain enthusiasts would scream back at him saying</p>
<p>DUH! IT&#x2019;S CRYPTO!</p>
<p>To my surprise, however, everyone agreed with him. Social media is so weird like that.</p>
<p>So, here&#x2019;s what I say. Look, the yield is 6.2% APY in bitcoin or ethereum, not cash. So you&#x2019;re still making a bet on cryptocurrency. This we know. Most people on Steemit or with enough BTC or ETH to consider locking it up for the long-term are not gonna bat an eye at the potential bone-crushing volatility in cash returns on these things. They just want to increase their STACKZ.</p>
<p>I like it. What&#x2019;s the big deal?</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ll give my kid 1 BTC in that account and forget about it.</p>
<p>By the time she goes to college, she&#x2019;ll either have 2 BTC worth a bunch of USD, and I mean like maybe enough to pay for her whole collegiate adventure and still have some satoshis left over to go travelling a bit, or she&#x2019;ll have 2 BTC worth nothing.</p>
<p>Either way she&#x2019;ll have about 2x&#x2019;ed her return in crypto terms with this BlockFi product.</p>
<p>Sounds like a &#x201C;Heads I win. Tails I don&#x2019;t lose too much&#x201D; scenario to me.</p>

            <p>Zion Williamson and I are from the same state. If you don&#x2019;t know who he is, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEJb8Iyv4n8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clip</a>. To put it simply, he is going to be a star in the NBA.</p>
<p>A megastar.</p>
<p>He is 6 feet 8 inches or so tall, 280 pounds depending on how much he has recently eaten at the Blue Devil Tower.</p>
<p>You aren&#x2019;t <em>that</em> big and, at the same time, <em>that</em> athletic without working towards <em>that</em> goal for quite a while, which is why I wanted to highlight what Zion has posted on the top of his Twitter even today.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZxtiMAwTm5emntpQRgqytahMmghKzuzfRXeCUM8wKEc9/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Zion Williamson <a href="https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2018/01/20/zion-williamson-commits-duke-2018-recruiting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared for Duke on January 20, 2018</a> but he pinned this Tweet on the top of his Twitter account more than 18 months prior to that.</p>
<p>And it is still posted there today.</p>
<p>Even though, as the 44th president of the United States, Barack Obama, pointed out the other night when Zion&#x2019;s standard-issue (for all Duke players) Nike&#x2019;s exploded causing a potentially college career-ending injury on literally the first play of the game against uber-rival the University of North Carolina Tar Heels,</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmY37PgyeNZNwxZ24mQJHW6voYycBXhREMneJbSVMBKMZ7/image.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="&#x201C;His-shoe-broke-&#x201D;"><a href="#&#x201C;His-shoe-broke-&#x201D;" class="headerlink" title="&#x201C;His shoe broke!&#x201D;"></a>&#x201C;His shoe broke!&#x201D;</h2><p>I&#x2019;m sure this setback will be just another hurdle to climb in what I hope will be a long and illustrious career for the Iron Lion Zion. He certainly has the right mentality to overcome anything set in his path. Long-term goal setting and a consistent work ethic are hallmarks of success. Zion&#x2019;s pinned tweet proves it.</p>
<p>So I think this</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUhVWUWhFMdrPFNqS56JatQjKN6pcgnLApxi5KSn5SpKT/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>won&#x2019;t stop Zion Williamson from cashing in on all of his hard work as the consensus first pick in the 2019 NBA Draft.</p>
<p>We all may not be world talent level athletes but we can certainly learn a few things from the Iron Lion Zion. Namely,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Be yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Believe in yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inspire yourself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing else matters.</p>

            <p>With all this talk about Jamie Dimon&#x2019;s complete reversal on crypto, I thought I&#x2019;d highlight this <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/digital-currency-scam-jpmorgan-branding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bit of news from 2015</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmbS8iyAzoUf6hRx7zkY3QeG3YwPvfmeKFzry6XYxDx3a7/JP%20MORGAN.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Actually, the link above is not even about JP Morgan &amp; Chase Co&#x2019;s obsession with creating a digital asset on the blockchain to mimic the usefulness of bitcoin. I just found that picture on this <a href="https://steemit.com/jamiedimon/@mardah.resonance/jp-morgan-ceo-fraud-bankster-jamie-dimon-rejected-175-times-trying-to-patent-bitcoin-style-payment-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old Steemit post from last year</a> by @mardah.resonance and I figured I&#x2019;d save old @ned the server cost and reuse this fine graphic. For the record, I just find it more than a wee bit funny that the old &#x201C;Bulge Bracket&#x201D; bank has been desperately trying (and failing) to make something &#x201C;bitcoin-y&#x201D; for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Not only that, but check this out!</p>
<p>Apparently, this is not the first time we&#x2019;ve had a &#x201C;JPM Coin&#x201D; in the cryptocurrency industry. Some Chinese scammers used this exact name brand back in 2015 to try and rope some unsuspecting retail investors (in China, they call them &#x201C;leeks&#x201D;) in to what was basically an MLM scheme.</p>
<p>It got so bad that the China division of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. had to <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/country/US/en/jpmorgan/china/cn/news/jpm-coin-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue a statement</a> on Oct. 30, 2015. </p>
<p>&#x6469;&#x6839;&#x5927;&#x901A;&#x83B7;&#x6089;&#xFF0C;&#x4E00;&#x4E9B;&#x7F51;&#x7AD9;&#x3001;&#x5FAE;&#x535A;&#x4EE5;&#x53CA;&#x5FAE;&#x4FE1;&#x5E73;&#x53F0;&#x6B63;&#x5728;&#x63A8;&#x5E7F;&#x9500;&#x552E;&#x6469;&#x6839;&#x5E01;(JPM Coin)&#x3002;&#x8FD9;&#x4E9B;&#x7F51;&#x7AD9;&#x3001;&#x5FAE;&#x535A;&#x548C;&#x5FAE;&#x4FE1;&#x5E73;&#x53F0;&#x5747;&#x4E0E;&#x6469;&#x6839;&#x5927;&#x901A;&#x53CA;&#x5176;&#x96C6;&#x56E2;&#x516C;&#x53F8;&#x65E0;&#x5173;&#x3002;&#x6469;&#x6839;&#x5927;&#x901A;&#x53CA;&#x5176;&#x5728;&#x534E;&#x6216;&#x5168;&#x7403;&#x7684;&#x4EFB;&#x4F55;&#x5173;&#x8054;&#x673A;&#x6784;&#x5747;&#x672A;&#x53D1;&#x552E;&#x8BE5;&#x540D;&#x4E3A;&#x201C;&#x6469;&#x6839;&#x5E01; (JPM Coin)&#x201D;&#x7684;&#x4EA7;&#x54C1;&#x3002;&#x6469;&#x6839;&#x5927;&#x901A;&#x5E76;&#x672A;&#x6388;&#x6743;&#x4EFB;&#x4F55;&#x6B64;&#x7C7B;&#x6216;&#x5176;&#x5B83;&#x7C7B;&#x4F3C;&#x7684;&#x865A;&#x62DF;&#x8D27;&#x5E01;&#xFF0C;&#x4E5F;&#x672A;&#x6388;&#x6743;&#x4EE5;&#x4EFB;&#x4F55;&#x65B9;&#x5F0F;&#x63D0;&#x53CA;JPMorgan,&#x6469;&#x6839;&#x5927;&#x901A;&#xFF0C;&#x6469;&#x6839;&#x7B49;&#x3002;</p>
<p>Here is the English translation:</p>
<p>&#x201C;JPMorgan Chase learned that some websites, Weibo Corporation and WeChat platforms are promoting the sale of JPM Coin. These websites, Weibo and WeChat platforms are not related to JP Morgan Chase and its group companies. JPM Coin and its affiliates in China or around the world have not sold the product called JPM Coin. JPMorgan does not authorize any such or other similar virtual currency, nor does it authorize any reference to JPMorgan, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan, etc.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Which all leads me to ask the question,</p>
<p>So, when issuing its first bitcoin-like cryptoasset, out of all the potential names one could pick, why would JP Morgan Chase use the exact same branding as the 2015 scammers? &#x1F914;</p>
<p>Inquiring minds want to know.</p>

<p>Six years I&#x2019;ve been trying to learn how to make Chinese dumplings. And in 6 years, I&#x2019;ve managed very little progress. But still that doesn&#x2019;t mean I don&#x2019;t enjoy trying! The best part is, even when your jiaozis look like sad little sacks, you still get to eat the expert dumplings prepared by grandma and grandpa. &#x1F60D;</p>

            <p>Tomorrow I head back to Dongbei for my annual pilgrimage &#x201C;Beyond the Wall.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Of course, I&#x2019;m not talking about the fictitious ice wall in the Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m talking about going north of the biggest, baddest manmade wall in all of history:</p>
<p>The Great Wall.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of the eastern end of the Great Wall, which is clearly what HBO was modeling the above picture on.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUZ1saXMuqVz1rQvgFz4mqHQzUHq9XZEo7sLnXtcvMNAd/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Were it not for the typically searing pollution this time of year, northeast China is kinda great. At least for a week or two. Sure, I&#x2019;ll miss the hustle and bustle of Shanghai. But shooting fireworks, drinking baijiu, and gorging on dumplings is not that bad, either.</p>
<p>Plus, it&#x2019;s like a week-plus of speaking straight Chinese 24/7, so you know my second language is gonna be baller when I get back to the grind. That&#x2019;s always a plus.</p>
<p>Still, sometimes I just gotta sneak in some TV time or traipse off to the town&#x2019;s only (and newly built since 2016) McDonald&#x2019;s. I swear I have no idea how I got any work done up in Dongbei before they built that blessed Mickey D&#x2019;s!</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s the coffee.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQkzDYsiGhxHjGS6wwmcGXYsirL8UBJswQUZD3bpNzps9/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>My Chinese family thinks I&#x2019;m insane. They say, &#x201C;Here is some Nescafe. Just add hot water!&#x201D; &#x1F630;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x8FD9;&#x662F;&#x5F88;&#x597D;&#x559D;&#xFF01;&#x53C8;&#x751C;&#x53C8;&#x70ED;&#x3002;&#x4F60;&#x4E0D;&#x9700;&#x8981;&#x522B;&#x7684;&#x3002;&#x6211;&#x4EEC;&#x4E5F;&#x6709;&#x51B0;&#x5496;&#x5561;&#x3002;&#x4F60;&#x53EF;&#x4EE5;&#x5728;&#x8D85;&#x5E02;&#x968F;&#x4FBF;&#x4E70;&#x554A;&#x3002;&#x201D;</p>
<p>But true coffeeheads know what I&#x2019;m talking about. If I go a few days without coffee, my head starts to throb and I start to get the jitters. Not only that, but I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;m not the nicest person to hang out with. And that&#x2019;s what the Spring Festival is all about.</p>
<p>Hanging with the fam.</p>
<p>Every single waking hour of the whole week-plus.</p>
<p>So, yes, I may sneak off to McDonald&#x2019;s to get some precious uninterrupted hours in to finish some work (After all, most of the people I work for don&#x2019;t care that it is Chinese New Year!), but really I just need to find some peace and quiet where I can pound back a couple free refills of the liquid gold before walking back the kilometer-plus to the family abode in sub-zero temperatures.</p>
<p>It goes on like that for 6-7 days. Every day a new relative&#x2019;s house to visit. Every day some sort of delicious pig soup and plates and plates of <em>jiaozi</em>. And then I start to get anxious about making it back to the big city. You see there&#x2019;s no way to buy a train ticket for the day you want to leave. They are all sold out. You just have to sit there and wait (or rather my wife begs my sister-in-law to work some kind of Chinese internet magic) and wait and wait&#x2026; and wait until somebody returns their train ticket online. And then and only then, my sister-in-law performs some kind of magic Millennial internet voodoo and&#x2026; <em>voila!</em> All of a sudden I am headed back home the next day. The wife and kid trailing a couple days behind.</p>
<p>Then we&#x2019;ll work and work and lose ourselves in the everyday toil of life for a few months&#x2026;</p>
<p>And then we&#x2019;ll do it all over again next year.</p>
<p>Happy Year of the Pig &#x1F437;everybody! &#x5927;&#x5BB6;&#x606D;&#x559C;&#x53D1;&#x8D22;&#xFF01; &#x1F64F;</p>
