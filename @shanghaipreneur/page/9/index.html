        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Interestingly, Warren Buffett does not follow the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) himself. But, in the plainspoken way that only he can get away with, he unequivocally states that, for less talented investors than himself, EMH is most likely the best theory available to guide one&#x2019;s investing.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s crazy that Buffett is the one making these kinds of statements. After all, it is precisely his consistent investment success that provides the best example of why efficient market theory is preposterous.</p>
<p>But there it is in black-and-white. I even found it on an inspirational quote meme so you know it must be a direct quote from the Oracle of Omaha himself.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmbkvNVZRtmRCyuGcq2ytxXGPcBPbftGgUpFYmjjsAypV1/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Buffet&#x2019;s views on the supposed efficiency of the market are summed up by an oft-repeated parable of his. Mr. Market is an allegory used in Benjamin Graham&#x2019;s renowned security analysis course at Columbia University. Buffett earned a master of economics there in 1951. If you want to read more about the story of Mr. Market check out my blog post on the subject, <a href="http://www.lowbetaportfolio.com/who-is-mr-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#x201C;Who is Mr. Market?&#x201D;</a>, but the basic idea is that Mr. Market represents the senseless everyman investor that we all wish we weren&#x2019;t but know, in our heart of hearts, that we probably are.</p>
<p>He offers practical advice about the vagaries of Mr. Market in the 1987 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Letter to Shareholders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, like Cinderella at the ball, you must heed one warning or everything will turn into pumpkins and mice: Mr. Market is there to serve you, not to guide you. It is his pocketbook, not his wisdom, that you will find useful. If he shows up some day in a particularly foolish mood, you are free to either ignore him or to take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you fall under his influence. Indeed, if you aren&#x2019;t certain that you understand and can value your business far better than Mr. Market, you don&#x2019;t belong in the game. As they say in poker, &#x201C;If you&#x2019;ve been in the game 30 minutes and you don&#x2019;t know who the patsy is, you&#x2019;re the patsy.&#x201D;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmfGyyn3Xa88Rr32N4B8QGeN4AFhrkfWEzzULPvAqgijsW/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Buffett bases this folksy perspective on his one true and unique skill - his verifiable talent in the field of capital allocation. He even goes so far as to say that he won the &#x201C;ovarian lottery&#x201D; by being placed in a political and legal system that for some reason rewards his one particular, and some might even say peculiar, talent in an exponential way. (By the way, the above image is obviously copyright Disney, FYI.)</p>
<p>Robert P. Miles describes Buffett&#x2019;s famous humblebrag in his book, <em>Warren Buffett Wealth: Principles and Practical Methods Used by the World&#x2019;s Greatest Investor</em> (available on Google Play):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was gifted with unique skills to value companies, coupled with being born during the time period that would enjoy the greatest economic expansion and would be capitalism&#x2019;s finest hour to date. One simply cannot underestimate the luck of being born in the United States, home of 4 percent of the world&#x2019;s population but one half of the world&#x2019;s capital and publicly traded companies, with a political and legal system that disproportionately rewards capital allocation talent over most other occupations, and during a century that experienced a sevenfold increase in the standard of living. (24)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buffett understands that he is incredibly lucky to have these talents. And to have them at this particular point in the trajectory of capitalist history. But he also understands that not everyone is preternaturally suited to his unique occupation, nor would they enjoy it as much as he does. In those cases in which people do not share his predisposition to master capital allocation strategy, Buffett believes that EMH serves the majority of &#x201C;regular&#x201D; investors in the best way possible.</p>
<p>Note the advice he would give to the investment trustee of his own children that he offers in the 2013 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My advice to the trustee could not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard&#x2019;s.) I believe the trust&#x2019;s long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors &#x2013; whether pension funds, institutions or individuals &#x2013; who employ high-fee managers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These principles set a high bar for aspiring fund managers. But it is their collective struggle to exceed some benchmark that unleashes the power of efficient market theory in the first place. Buffett&#x2019;s investing philosophy exposes this dialectic for the interminable struggle that it is and forever will be.</p>
<p>Can YOU consistently beat the market? Probably not.</p>
<p>But the fact that YOU and everyone else thinks they can is what makes the market efficient in the first place. This conundrum informs how Buffett stands astride this issue.</p>
<p>Any investor in any given year can do better than the market. But those that do so consistently have a plan, a strategy, a system for continuous improvement that is continually improved upon itself that distinguishes their investments.</p>
<p>Does that sound like you? If not, it&#x2019;s off to the S&amp;P with you.</p>
<p>And that&#x2019;s fine.</p>
<p>Hopefully, understanding Buffet&#x2019;s nuanced position will help us all to</p>

            <p>I&#x2019;m not a big BitcoinCash (BCH) fan.</p>
<p>But I don&#x2019;t hate it either. Although a friend and I did perform a little experiment the other day&#x2026;</p>
<p>We sent Litecoin (LTC) and BCH at the exact same time&#x2026; and the BCH arrived 34 minutes after the LTC did&#x2026; &#x1F62D;&#x1F62D;&#x1F62D; so that has me feeling a little more bearish on Roger Ver&#x2019;s shill project.</p>
<p>And of course it has more than doubled in the past ten days because, well, you know, crypto! Woo-hoo! It doesn&#x2019;t have to make any sense. It just has to MOON!</p>
<p>But maybe there is a reason for all this action besides the fact that Jolly Roger is swapping out his BTC for BCH by the millions. I&#x2019;m not a Bitcoin Maximalist by any means. I mean, don&#x2019;t get me wrong, Bitcoin is cool AF but third-generation blockchain networks like Aion, Wanchain, Cardano etc. are just capable of so much more&#x2026;</p>

<p>That&#x2019;s why I was like, &#x201C;Looky here!&#x201D; when I read about <a href="https://memo.cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memo.cash</a>, the most recent project on the BCH network. You can read about it <a href="https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@fycee/memo-cash-the-social-media-of-bitcoin-cash-bch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/04/15/bitcoin-cash-gets-twitter-like-social-network-running-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, which is where I also got the trippy horse image.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s basically a primitive twitter Dapp, but with all your little musings and observations recorded for time immemorial on every BCH node that there is and ever will be.</p>
<p>Now whether or not that is actually a good thing is beside the point. The takeaway is that</p>

<p>Like Jimmy O. Yang&#x2019;s character writes on episode 4 of the most recent season of Silicon Valley:</p>
<p>&#x201C;I went to China to do New New Internet.&#x201D;</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s totally something you can do now.</p>

            <p>Well, the full moon technically came out on March 31, 2018 and the new moon is set to visit us on Sunday, April 15.</p>
<p>But that didn&#x2019;t stop bitcoin from making its own moon today on Thursday, April 12, 2018.</p>

<p>Nearly $100 million of volume occurred at around 6:30 p.m. Beijing time. How do I know this? Well, please just check out my very excellent technical analysis (TA) from my very own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/7574371/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blockfolio</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmcbKb6tgkJumR6kA8yXqKoTBJqEvjL8CmJnsPtu5ZQLGw/231523549441_.pic.jpg" alt="231523549441_.pic.jpg"></p>
<p>See! TA is easy, @haejin!</p>
<p>Market order books all over the world went way way out of whack. I know because I had a big order in for ZEN at 0.06 ETH even&#x2026; that&#x2019;s my new job - I&#x2019;m a ZEN shill. Ever since they started talking about their new supernodes, and then they went and published this <a href="https://zencash.com/assets/files/Zen-Application-Platform-Whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awesome whitepaper</a> about it, which is like 7 pages of pure crypto-revolution! But I digress&#x2026;</p>
<p>I checked the order book after my class was over and noticed that my order at 0.06 ETH had finally filled, but but I also found out that</p>
<h2 id="some-orders-had-been-filled-as-low-as-0-0426"><a href="#some-orders-had-been-filled-as-low-as-0-0426" class="headerlink" title="some orders had been filled as low as 0.0426!!!"></a>some orders had been filled as low as 0.0426!!!</h2><p>Obviously, that meant either ZEN crashed or ETH mooned&#x2026; It was the latter.</p>
<p>As always, people try to explain why such a drastic unexpected move happens.</p>
<p>We of course had the Mt. Goxers out with the claim that <a href="https://blockchain.info/tx/9e813715fe9099f26ccda06c164f97cd46121e65d69b482222e7d2c3dd20fa91" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this transaction</a> was a move by legal counsel to sell their lode on Bittrex. Although how that portends a bullish move I don&#x2019;t know. (Seems bearish to me, but I guess we&#x2019;ll see in the next few days.)</p>
<p>We also have an interesting theory put forth by <a href="https://uk.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoin-surges-after-paper-says-cryptos-are-compliant-with-sharia-law-1123911" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a> that publicizes a recent paper by Mufti Muhammad Abu Bakar, Sharia advisor and compliance officer at Blossom Finance, that claims that cryptocurrency is one of the few Western finance constructs that is compatible with the Sharia prohibition against fractional reserve banking.</p>
<p>I bet you can find another hundred theories as to why bitcoin, all of a sudden, after a long few days of rangebound trading, suddenly JUMPED out to a thousand-dollar increase in less than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>I know it&#x2019;s crazy.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s totally like OMG WTF!</p>
<p>(Coincidentally, OmiseGo was also up 23% - more than Bitcoin&#x2019;s leap - as of this writing. The What The Fuck Coin is, to my knowledge, still not available. WTF fuh realz!)</p>
<p>But I think everyone ignores the most likely proposition.</p>
<p>It just happened for no reason at all.</p>
<p>The legendary mentor of Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham, is famous for saying, &#x201C;In the short run the market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The crypto markets today were a day for the weighing machines.</p>

            <p>One of my old Chinese neighbors told me something today, <em>ku</em> <em>mu</em> <em>feng</em> <em>chun</em> or in Chinese characters, that&#x2019;s</p>
<h2 id="&#x67AF;&#x6728;&#x9022;&#x6625;"><a href="#&#x67AF;&#x6728;&#x9022;&#x6625;" class="headerlink" title="&#x67AF;&#x6728;&#x9022;&#x6625;"></a>&#x67AF;&#x6728;&#x9022;&#x6625;</h2><p>I&#x2019;m not necessarily all that into <em>chengyu</em> (as in I don&#x2019;t really know that many) but what I am into is the fact that literally a billion people understand the second and third layer of meaning you are trying to convey and you can do all that in just 4 simple characters.</p>
<p>This particular <em>chengyu</em> means that the &#x201C;withered trees burst afresh in spring&#x201D; and implies a person getting a new life. The <em>chengyu</em> first appeared in a legend where one of the Taoist eight immortals named Zhang Guolao, an 80-year-old cleric, married an 18 year-old daughter of Wei Shu. Lao Zhang certainly felt like a withered tree bursting on that wedding night!</p>
<p>So if this is indeed the crypto markets finding bottom, all of us who are still here have now certainly earned our &#x201C;rings&#x201D; on the inside of our withered old tree limbs.</p>
<p>We are all well-rooted ancient trees in which the first strong winds of spring stir the first green shoots of life.</p>

            <p>Despite our best efforts, it seems to me like we are all still living in the shadow of September 15, 2008. For those of you who forgot, were too young to care, or just plain don&#x2019;t want to remember, here&#x2019;s a little reminder:</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmRY59JKSr5CLCNJ5YEyPqqEzHjZW4nJn1f1rZkn1cNXJ4/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The accumulation of financial damages rang out throughout the land. The collective consciousness of America grieved at its paper losses. But people did what they always do to keep on truckin&#x2019;&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A; they ate, drank, and farted away&#x200A;&#x2014;and let &#x200A;their lizard brain take over.</p>
<p>But those of us who remember, we knew somehow that the game was rigged. That this one class of people was chosen to be exercise some sort of &#x201C;Get Out of Jail Free&#x201D; card and this other class of people were not. It was odd to see it all laid plainly before our eyes. It wasn&#x2019;t like it was anything new. I mean the median income of all Americans hasn&#x2019;t budged in 20 years.</p>
<p>!{}(<a href="https://steemitimages.com/DQmUfg3V9SE7Lsr4U6mxon439ifnYnnrZ3G4MLQQejf5LA9/image.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemitimages.com/DQmUfg3V9SE7Lsr4U6mxon439ifnYnnrZ3G4MLQQejf5LA9/image.png</a>)</p>
<p>But to see the absurd ribaldry of bailing out the Too Big To Fail (TBTF) banks (and thus all of the people who worked at them - thereby rewarding the very same citizens that had had the most to do with the financial collapse in the first place) was just too much.</p>
<p>Politicians just call people lazy and leave them to rot. But a society is just not set up correctly when its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gini coefficient</a> is over 40, which is what the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI?locations=US-CN-NL-ID-GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Bank reports today</a>. A Gini coefficient of 50 is considered to be an absurdly high indicator of income inequality. Such a situation demands economic reforms.</p>

<p>Satoshi Nakomoto apparently was a strong believer in the critique of the TBTF system. After all, more than a few of us still drop to our knees today screaming, &#x201C;How could you?&#x201D; before getting up, dusting ourselves off, and moving on with our day. But he did something about it.</p>
<p>He published <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</a> in October 2008 and he released the first bitcoin software in January 2009. The very bottom of the market came two months later on <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/year-ago-today-dow-hit-bottom-recession/story?id=10046578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 9, 2009</a>, the Dow at a 12-year low of 6,547.05.</p>
<p>Sometimes you don&#x2019;t choose a project. It chooses you. Really, that&#x2019;s how it is. &#x200A;It&#x2019;s part of your everyday life forever. You have to live and breathe the stuff, be comfortable with it, remain humble and try to live out a relatively comfortable kind of life. The great project that you spent a couple months on just because it came to you in a dream and you had to do it, shouldn&#x2019;t interfere with your right to a semi-private fulfilling life.</p>
<p>And so he&#x2026; or she&#x2026; or they&#x2026; or it&#x2026; is anonymous.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m fine with that.</p>
<p>I got into finance to find out what the hell went wrong back then in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Because to me it wasn&#x2019;t a &#x201C;panic,&#x201D; as former Fed chief Ben Bernanke recently put it in a <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace/bonus-bernanke-geithner-and-paulson-full-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketplace interview</a>, it was a disaster. Because all I know is that whatever THAT was, that was not right. I&#x2019;ve been trying to do something about THAT for years, but I don&#x2019;t know that I&#x2019;ve come up with anything good about it, even though I&#x2019;ll be writing a dissertation about some of THAT in the near future.</p>
<p>Satoshi Nakomoto has already done something about THAT. And zhe did it all almost at the very nadir of the global market swoon. And for that we should all be grateful.</p>
<p>At least in the academic pursuit of finance, and I can&#x2019;t really speak from the perspective of the wider finance industry itself, at least in academics, we spend a lot of time trying to understand, prevent, and safeguard against the inevitable next economic crash. And we should.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s what Satoshi was trying to do way back almost ten years ago.</p>
