        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>McDonald&#x2019;s is clearly one of the most innovative companies in the world.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve been saying this for a while now. I even wrote an <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/2964056-mcdonalds-the-powerhouse-you-never-think-of-when-you-think-about-innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article on Seeking Alpha</a> about it.</p>
<p>It may seem crazy on the surface, but when you think about it, it makes sense.</p>
<p>Franchising, the drive-thru, the long-term property plays enhanced by development with OPM (other people&#x2019;s money)&#x2026; All of these inventions came directly from the mind of McDonald&#x2019;s de facto founder, Ray Kroc. He was a genius. I&#x2019;ve been a fan of Kroc since before Batman played him in <em>The Founder</em>, but if you haven&#x2019;t seen that movie yet, it&#x2019;s definitely worth a couple hours. If you&#x2019;re a business strategy head like me, you might even want to watch it twice.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmfA6zpkzEumUBivg3KTcAUoFtCFQdifgzbBh5xEfxZ2ms/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Yeah sure, maybe <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/dark-side-business-how-ray-kroc-movie-founder-has-echoes-trump-556538" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he screwed over the ol&#x2019; McDonald brothers</a>. But c&#x2019;mon guys! Get that shit in writing!</p>
<p>Moreover, he didn&#x2019;t invent them but he created a corporate culture that led to the creation of more than a few products that enjoy a billion dollars in annual revenue: the Big Mac, Filet-o-Fish, and the Egg McMuffin to name just three.</p>
<p>Today, August 6th, is apparently the 50th birthday of the BigMac and, to celebrate, Mickey D&#x2019;s is giving out MacCoin to everybody who stands in line today in China.</p>
<p>What is a MacCoin? Well, rumors were this promotion was actually going to involve cryptocurrency. It certainly would have been a much cheaper rollout if it had been, but it&#x2019;s actually a hard coin. Here is a picture for the numismatists among you.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmcEf4DARrPeQ7n8AtxqtWxVbkoKRjEguoaghxDpSR4ivg/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t know how they&#x2019;re gonna keep track of all these free burgers without a blockchain or how they&#x2019;re going to record this massive accounting liability on their balance sheet, but hey &#x201C;Not my problem!&#x201D;</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m just a fat and happy shareholder/customer who has seen his stock nearly double since purchasing a bunch of shares in my Roth IRA <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/2840076-im-lovin-these-10-potential-catalysts-for-a-mcdonalds-turnaround-in-2015-part-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2015</a> around <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/2886816-10-potential-catalysts-for-a-mcdonalds-turnaround-in-2015-part-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the time Steve Easterbrook took over as CEO</a>.</p>
<p>Just look at these people standing in line! They love Big Macs!</p>
<p>From the front:</p>
<p><img src="https://image-store.slidesharecdn.com/a0661bb3-7db6-404b-bf75-1da25f90949c-original.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://image-store.slidesharecdn.com/90234e3b-25c0-42de-b372-b1f773610c0a-original.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The Chinese clearly are crazy &#x2018;bout some free delicious Big Macs.</p>
<p>Keep working it, Ronald McDonald, you crazy clown you!</p>

        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Now that the World Cup is over, the piles of international gambling money can get back to doing what it was enjoying doing so much before this whirlwind tour of non-stop soccer/football/futbol action distracted most of us for the past month.</p>
<p>What&#x2019;s that you say?</p>
<p>China&#x2019;s infamous &#x201C;hot money&#x201D; has been obsessed with only one pursuit pretty much in the past year:</p>
<p>Investing in altcoins!</p>
<p>What a lot of people have overlooked is just how much Chinese capital is tied up in the World Cup.</p>
<p>The New York Times has been spilling a lot of pixels on this thesis lately. To wit:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/magazine/china-wont-play-in-this-world-cup-it-still-hopes-to-profit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China Won&#x2019;t Play in This World Cup. It Still Hopes to Profit.</a> (May 30, 2018)</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/07/04/sports/soccer/04reuters-soccer-worldcup-fifa-china.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China&#x2019;s World Cup One Day? It&#x2019;s Already Here</a> (July 4, 2018)</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/07/08/sports/soccer/08reuters-soccer-worldcup-fifa-china.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chinese World Cup Sponsorship Not About Filling Gaps: FIFA</a> (July 8, 2018)</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/sports/world-cup/world-cup-start-time.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The World Cup Final&#x2019;s Unconventional Start Time</a> (July 13, 2018)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some highlights of this small cluster of articles:</p>
<p>Due to corruption scandals in Russia and within the organization itself, FIFA had trouble selling its ad inventory until a &#x201C;real lifeline came from a cluster of Chinese companies willing to pay hundreds of millions of dollars and save the day.&#x201D; These companies included Wanda (cinemas and property development), Hisense (electronics), Vivo (smartphones), Mengniu (dairy products), and Yadea (electric scooters). Budweiser and McDonald&#x2019;s, two of the longest tenured FIFA partners, these brands are not!</p>
<p>Chinese tourists bought more tickets (40,000) to the games than even England supporters. Yes, those annoying guys who kept yelling &#x201C;It&#x2019;s coming home&#x201D; for 3 weeks to anyone who would listen. There were more Chinese in Russia for the Cup than them! There are even Chinese children acting as flag bearers. FIFA even shifted the start of the World Cup final match forward by a few hours to give the Chinese market a fighting chance to stay up and watch the world&#x2019;s largest televised event.</p>
<p>And watch we did! Lots of us.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdwupSKxzwYoLH3eeDrv7btaNJHmMGLAPrCuhFZCjM2tR/world%20cup%20selfie%202018.jpeg" alt="world cup selfie 2018.jpeg"></p>
<p>Legitimate business interests are not the only providers of Chinese capital interested in the World Cup these days. On Friday the 13th of July, reports were published outlining a <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2155118/chinese-police-break-us15-billion-cryptocurrency-world-cup-gambling-ring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 billion World Cup gambling ring based in China</a> that was using cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin specifically, to manage its books. Assuredly, that bust is just the tip of the iceberg, for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6423969545190498304" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chinese culture is obsessed with gambling and get-rich-quick schemes</a> in general.</p>
<p>Just how much money left the cryptosphere for the fun times of World Cup prop bets and all-night drinking binges is, of course, impossible to tell. But data points like the $1.5 billion above give us a glimpse.</p>
<p>Another strikingly correlated statistic is the total crypto market cap leading up to the start of the World Cup on June 14, 2018. Here is the data from Coinmarketcap from June 1 to today:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmeAHvMRkqeda6fNaznaSxYRW7Edyfhr8KC7AWSJ8ErKs3/Screen%20Shot%202018-07-16%20at%208.35.27%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-07-16 at 8.35.27 PM.png"></p>
<p>Notice the decline from around $350 billion on June 10 to around $265 billion on June 14, the day of that most embarrassing opening game where Russia destroyed Saudi Arabia, 5-0. To me, that&#x2019;s a clear consequence of betting capital (i.e. &#x201C;hot money&#x201D;) being moved from cryptocurrency exchanges to betting platforms both licit and illicit.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s action only confirms my hypothesis. The entire cryptosphere is up about 4.7% since Kylian Mbapp&#xE9;&#x2019;s historical goal less than 24 hours ago.</p>
<p>Time will only tell if this trend will continue. But I&#x2019;ll go out on a limb and say I&#x2019;m confident that it will.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>To put it simply, Chinese mining pools <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control about 70%</a> of the Bitcoin blockchain hashing power. Moreover, I&#x2019;ve heard it said that just a little less than half of the capital that has entered the cryptomarket in the past 18 months has been from China. Plus, signalling from the widely recognized government mouthpiece <em>Global Times</em> indicates that bitcoin will soon get a reprieve from the Chinese government. An article titled <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1104753.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Improved regulation makes more sense than just saying no to bitcoin in China</a> was published just 2 weeks before the Cup. Lastly, if we&#x2019;re truly headed into a Trump-induced trade war, and it looks like we are, bitcoin and its revolutionary ability to displace the US Dollar as an international reserve currency, just may be China&#x2019;s real &#x201C;trump card&#x201D; if it wants to stay afloat in a battle of attrition.</p>
<p>Putting all these bits and pieces together leads me to one important overriding conclusion that we can takeaway from the first truly Chinese World Cup ever. And that is:</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I&#x2019;m kinda working off <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6414422773271187456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this post from LinkedIn</a> that I wrote. Sometimes the best way to think is to write. Wait. Not even sometimes. All the time. When you learn to edit yourself, that&#x2019;s when you start to think. So here&#x2019;s my effort at thinking.</p>
<p>I want to conduct a crazy little thought experiment. I want you to imagine &#x201C;real estate values in China&#x201D; and think to yourself exactly, &#x201C;What does a &#x2018;nice house&#x2019; look like?</p>
<p>&#x201C;What does a &#x2018;nice apartment&#x2019; look like?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Think to yourself:</p>
<h2 id="WHAT-DOES-30-MILLION-LOOK-LIKE"><a href="#WHAT-DOES-30-MILLION-LOOK-LIKE" class="headerlink" title="WHAT DOES $30 MILLION LOOK LIKE?"></a>WHAT DOES $30 MILLION LOOK LIKE?</h2><p>Does it look like this?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZEfng53d9b3bd5G2rawbZE9ztWpdqvcrxrWtNM9N1YVa/image.png" alt=""><br>Picture: homesoftherich.net (This house is Fort Wayne, IN and is part of a sprawling estate worth $30 million.)</p>
<p>Or maybe like this?<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmPsBuEPhv1t3XikteHCnviPLhHL96F6KcV7aaLSW5Xb54/image.png" alt=""><br>Picture: luxify.com (This house is in Beverly Hills, IN and is also worth $30 million!)</p>
<p>Now let me show you what $30 million of real estate value looks like in my neighborhood in Shanghai, China. Pictured here below is a modest little apartment building located reasonably near downtown Shanghai, China.</p>
<p>It has 30 units, each about 75 square meters each. If you assume a value per square meter at about 80,000 CNY per m2 (and honestly that&#x2019;s probably a little low at this point!), that&#x2019;s a 600,000 CNY valuation per unit, or approx. $1 MILLION USD PER UNIT.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s check out what it look likes here:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmekXm42BF5Hhv9getepyB9MZciwXLyY7FaXQgtd35ZQY3/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Yes, this measly squat little residential building you see pictured here represents $30 MILLION OF ASSET VALUE in the Chinese real estate markets of 2018.</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t know why maybe other people, especially if they are Chinese, don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s crazy. But to me the contrast is quite stark. Let me explain&#x2026;</p>
<p>Best case scenario&#x2026; if these units were all rentals&#x2026; they would yield&#x2026; in their current slipshod shape&#x2026; about $250,000 per year in rental income, representing approximately a 0.83% yield.</p>
<p>Clearly, the rationale for people buying Shanghai apartments today is not because they are income-producing investments. That leaves only the rationale that they are buying now in hopes of finding a &#x201C;Greater Fool&#x201D; later who is willing to buy at an even lower price-to-yield.</p>
<p>But, I mean&#x2026; 0.83% is already pretty low&#x2026; especially to ask for an investment as large as $30 million.</p>
<p>In the few decades of China&#x2019;s private real estate industry, so far that &#x201C;Greater Fool&#x201D; logic has worked. But it&#x2019;s not guaranteed to do that forever.</p>
<p>When you play Musical Chairs, eventually the music stops.</p>
<p>No wonder Jack Ma &amp; Li Ka-shing, among others, have recently called a top to the value of China&#x2019;s #buildings!</p>
<p>Does this building look like $30 MILLION to YOU?</p>

            <p>Please excuse the clickbait title, but I didn&#x2019;t know how else to get you Steemians to read about some old crazy trading stamp booklets your great-grandma used to spend hours managing while your great-grandpa fell asleep in his favorite chair after dinner. But that&#x2019;s what this article is about - the virtual currency that history has almost forgotten.</p>
<p>Recently, at the Woodstock of Capitalism, Warren Buffett and his elder sidekick Charles Munger gathered to dish dirt, talk investing, and dispense folksy aphorisms at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.</p>
<p>The Statler-and-Wardorf-type couple&#x2019;s comments about cryptocurrency were one of the most referenced quotes, at least in my little circle of cryptoficionados, during the <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/meet01/2018Meetinginfo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three day orgy</a> of discounted shopping, investor presentations, interviews, a 5K, and most importantly STEAK!!!</p>
<p>Qz reported the gist of the matter in a piece they published on <a href="https://qz.com/1271029/warren-buffett-hates-bitcoin-charlie-munger-compares-crypto-to-turds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 5</a>. Buffett warned, &#x201C;Cryptocurrencies will come to bad endings,&#x201D; while Munger claimed, &#x201C;To me, it&#x2019;s just dementia. It&#x2019;s like somebody else is trading turds and you decide you can&#x2019;t be left out.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVQf5oGz1YuFqSLg4mc4Axp9qLXkRFaVXULSmbW6uf6kr/buffet_munger_statler_wardorf&apos;.jpg" alt="buffet_munger_statler_wardorf&apos;.jpg"></p>
<p>But come on, one guy is 87 and the other is 94! You can&#x2019;t expect them to understand crypto. Besides, these are the guys that missed Apple even as late as 2011 when they plowed over $10 billion into IBM as a supposedly superior alternative. Had they invested in The Big Fruit back when its founder Steve Jobs died, which many people at the time recognized was a very big and very juicy buying opportunity, they would have nearly quadrupled their money!</p>
<p>As it stands, Berkshire exited IBM at a loss (Hey! You can&#x2019;t win &#x2018;em all). And they have a $45 billion-plus stake in the iPhone maker any way. To long-time followers of Buffett like myself, it must seem like we are getting close to Senile Buffett stage. It&#x2019;s really Bizarro Land to see Berkshire have any tech stock, much less make it the single biggest investment position in the entire world for a non-fund. When I was a kid, the Buffett I knew didn&#x2019;t invest in tech stocks because &#x201C;there is no margin of safety&#x201D; and he &#x201C;just doesn&#x2019;t understand&#x201D; them.</p>
<p>Well, things change it seems.</p>
<p>And Buffett&#x2019;s stance towards crypto will change, too. It&#x2019;s my belief that if he had enough time remaining in his life, he&#x2019;d come around to liking cryptocurrencies eventually as well. It may be some future as-yet-undreamed-of coin or, heck, it could even be Ethereum a few years from now! After all, this week also saw reports <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/montymunford/2018/05/18/apples-steve-wozniak-dumps-facebook-and-thinks-ethereum-could-be-the-new-apple/2/#14c906be6314" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Forbes nonetheless</a> claiming that the tech wunderkind behind Apple himself, Steve Wozniak, &#x201C;was extremely upbeat about Ethereum and described it as a platform that was just like Apple&#x2019;s and could become as influential as his company became.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Why is it an inevitable conclusion that, if given the time, Buffett would eventually embrace crypto? Well, first of all, he sure did come around on Apple in the end, didn&#x2019;t he? And second of all, well, that will require me to tell a story. So sit back and let me regale you with the tale of <strong>Blue Chip Stamps</strong>. </p>
<p>Buffett biographer Alice Schroeder discusses the importance of one investment in particular that changed the trajectory of Buffett&#x2019;s investment career. It was one of the few prescient buys that cemented the most important partnership of his life, bringing him the human version of Waldorf to his own Statler.</p>
<p>From Schroeder&#x2019;s excellent work <em>The Snowball</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He and Munger had also discovered another company they saw as promising and were buying as much stock of it as they could. This was Blue Chip Stamps, a trading-stamp company. They would buy it separately and together, and over the course of time Blue Chip would dramatically reshape the course of both men&#x2019;s careers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To describe what Blue Chip was as a company, you must travel back to a post-war time when mothers and grandmothers paid for groceries with cash and often had a few choices for their daily shopping available to them within walking distance of their home. As part of the change from their transaction and as a way to encourage repeat business, they would receive a fistful of stamps, stamps that were essentially a marketing giveaway, an early version of today&#x2019;s retail loyalty rewards programs. Customers eventually accumulated enough stamps to paste into little booklets and claim the modest reward of a blender, a television, a radio, a fishing rod, a tetherball set, etc. The most popular item to acquire with trading stamps was a toaster.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbH7HUY1mEAuQtH4WBEnmW5BhtAHgT4gksA31hunhmiDp/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These trading stamps were a fun free way to get cool stuff without influencing the rest of the household budget. Postwar consumers hoarded their stamps and collected books full of them and waited for when they could exchange those books for exotic items they would otherwise be unable to afford.</p>
<p>By the 1960s, there were so many trading stamp companies vying for customers that the competition drove them to accept just about anything as long as it was equal to the cash value of the collected stamps, which was something like $1.60 per 1,000 stamps. Crazy acquisitions in history via trading stamp include a Cessna airplane, a pair of gorillas (5.4 million S&amp;H Green Stamps), a donkey for an overseas church missionary, an elephant, and a variety of special equipment vehicles like school buses, ambulances, and fire trucks. </p>
<p>By 1964, industry leader Sperry &amp; Hutchinson alone printed three times as many stamps per year as the U.S. Post Office. When we reached &#x201C;peak trading stamp bubble&#x201D; (so to speak) in 1969, more than 80% of U.S. households collected them. The S&amp;H redemption catalog had a higher circulation than the Sears Roebuck, which for all you millennials out there is literally the company that defined what it meant to print a catalog.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdcsmaZFNT8uPXgurUDpaMT4Eu6ri94N2RmpoUPpxs75H/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These loyalty stamps were the byproduct of a rapidly vanishing era of thriftiness. Never waste. Never want. Never go into debt. But what Buffett and Munger liked so much about Blue Chip was not the aura of their youth, but rather the monopoly on stamp production that Blue Chip enjoyed with its vast array of retail partners. This partnership served also to limit the supply of Blue Chip tokens, er, um, stamps. The result was a unique kind of virtual currency that had no intrinsic value beyond what people ascribed to them. And oh did people assign value to them! Not only were the exotic items mentioned previously acquired solely with trading stamps but, in their time, they were literally everywhere.</p>
<p>Schroeder again quotes in her book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you had all the major oil companies and grocers giving out a single stamp, it became like money. People would leave their change behind and take the stamps. Morticians gave out stamps. Prostitutes gave them&#x2026; It was ubiquitous. Everybody had them. People even counterfeited them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait! How did such a sought after asset get unfairly maligned by the market? If everyone had these stamps, why would a bunch of value investors be able to cheaply buy them up hand over fist? The answer to that, my friends, is simple. And is also eerily reminiscent of the current crypto kerfuffle.</p>
<p><strong>Regulation</strong>. Stock in Blue Chip Stamps was so cheap because of the specter of regulation. (Sound familiar?). The Department of Justice had the company in their sights, eventually forcing it to sell a part of itself to the grocery chains that it had as its original customers. The industry original S&amp;H had served an antitrust suit against Blue Chip as well. There was a long line of potential lawsuits in the pipeline, too. But when some of these concerns came to the fore for a bit and shares dropped from a high of $25 to $13 a share, Buffett just kept right on buying, using whatever investment vehicle he had available to him at the time that had ready cash.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s hard to tell exactly how much money Buffett and Munger made off Blue Chip Stamps - primarily because they used its dwindling cash flows to buy superb companies like See&#x2019;s Candies and Wesco Financial, companies which are vital parts of their shared empire today.</p>
<p>But rest assured, in today&#x2019;s dollars, their profit would easily be measured <strong>IN THE BILLIONS</strong>.</p>
<p>So let&#x2019;s review, so the next time you hear about Warren Buffett hating on crypto, you too can recount the story of Blue Chip Stamps. Buffett and his most trusted investment partners sunk close to $100 million, which was at the time surely a princely sum, to buy a virtual currency of limited supply with no intrinsic value that was about to run the gauntlet against a whole host of regulators&#x2026;</p>
<p>And when they were in their 40s, they looked at this situation, not unlike the current cryptoasset markets at all, and decided upon one simple course of action:</p>
<p>AWL EEN!</p>

            <p>I recently came across an old Milton Friedman interview wherein he basically predicted Bitcoin would happen a full 10 years before it actually did.</p>
<p>Why is Milton Friedman important? We&#x2019;ll get to that in a minute. First, let&#x2019;s take a look at the old guy.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmYFVEnkSVd6Y8cPz3by3MYxMM64mdB31NuwM7EFGnuVkC/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Not exactly a software visionary, right? In this picture in particular he looks like he is trying to explain how a pencil works, like it was some kind of newfangled tech. I mean this guy was way old even back in 1999, when he said the following in an interview that has, for some reason, struck me as a very important quote today:</p>

<p>I mean that&#x2019;s a remarkably prescient statement for a super old guy who hadn&#x2019;t even seen a smartphone or YouTube yet. (He died in 2006 at the age of 94.) I remember 1999&#x2026; Not many of us around back then even knew what Google was!</p>
<p>And here is the architect of the extant modern financial system warning, dare I say advocating even, something he called</p>
<h2 id="e-cash"><a href="#e-cash" class="headerlink" title="e-cash"></a>e-cash</h2><p>##</p>

<p>In order to truly understand the importance of Friedman making a statement like this, one has to understand the rather substantial role he played in shaping the world&#x2019;s current economic order.</p>
<p>In the original form of the American-derived post-war international monetary system, the Bretton Woods system was a gold exchange standard with the US dollar (USD) as the only medium of exchange. Due to a long-standing conceit that interest rate jawboning by the Fed had cost Tricky Dick his first presidential election in 1960, the Nixon administration placed great weight on the power of the Federal Reserve System and its ability to both foster and direct American economic hegemony. At this time, in the Bretton Woods system of old, the essential status of the USD provided great international economic influence. But due to the very nature of international trade, which had been born at a time when gold was by far the internationally accepted store of value, the dollar had a tenuous hold on its global economic sway. The Bretton Woods System originally was constructed so that in order to exchange any national currency for gold, one had to first exchange that currency for USD. The USD was the only international currency that enjoyed this convertibility. As a result, all other currencies were pegged to it.</p>
<p>It was a privileged position.</p>
<p>Kinda like the United Kingdom enjoys being able to print British pounds as legal tender and still stay in the European Union. Only better.</p>
<p>But Nixon wanted more. He sensed a bigger prize. Moreover, the original Bretton Woods system was creaking under the weight of its assumptions. The United States continued to expand its money supply, thereby putting pressure on its ability to maintain gold reserves to cover those held by foreign central banks. It was kind of a ruse. Most countries kind of expected that the US could not withstand a run on their gold deposits. Then in 1965, Charles de Gaulle announced his intention to call America&#x2019;s bluff. He wanted the gold that was entitled to France by its enormous US dollar stockpile.</p>
<p>As other countries began to follow suit, it seemed that a portion of the pillar of America&#x2019;s economic might could easily be taken away. Switzerland and France announced their intention to redeem over $241 million of their dollar reserves for gold specie in 1971. More redemptions were on the horizon. In response, Nixon secretly cloistered his financial team at Camp David. Afterwards, he brashly severed the link between gold and the USD. The gold exchange standard was no more when Nixon made the following statement on national TV:</p>

<p>At the time, the &#x201C;Nixon Shock&#x201D; was seen as a short-term reactionary move designed to bully European allies into a desperately needed revaluation of their currencies. By 1973, however, all the major international currencies floated freely against each other 24 hours a day in an orgy of price movements without government intervention. This new form of the international financial system characterizes the &#x201C;ultimate objective&#x201D; (33) of Friedman&#x2019;s seminal 1962 work <em>Capitalism and Freedom</em>. The end of the fixed exchange rate mechanism birthed the volatile high-stakes world of hedge funds and high-frequency traders, the unintentional trademarks of modern international finance. </p>
<p>Friedman believed that a freely floating exchange rate system would be &#x201C;highly stable because basic economic policies and conditions are stable&#x201D; (69). In other words, economic reality would eventually reflect the theoretical perfection of economic theory. However, the Nixon Shock itself proved that economic policies are hardly, if ever, &#x201C;stable.&#x201D; Perhaps this utopian dream of classic neoliberal <em>laissez-faire</em> economics could have been realized upon a blank slate economy. But a greenfield did not exist.</p>
<p>Many observers at the time claimed that Bretton Woods was dead. Retrospectives were authored. Lessons from the system&#x2019;s demise were cataloged. But a funny thing happened on the way to the cemetery. The Bretton Woods &#x201C;sister organizations&#x201D; &#x2013; IMF, the World Bank, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which later provided the framework for the World Trade Organization (WTO) &#x2013; over time became increasingly powerful. And the main mechanism through which global central banks could intervene in the currency markets - their country&#x2019;s exchange rate with the USD - was replaced by Friedman&#x2019;s freely floating exchange rate regime.</p>
<p>That freely floating mechanism, however, never became currency agnostic. Instead, and curiously almost, it maintained the premium on USD accumulation. Central banks had already amassed, and never redeemed, vast amounts of USD assets in their official reserve portfolios during the pre-Nixon era of full dollar convertibility into gold.</p>
<p>Gold or not, it seemed they were hooked.</p>
<p>Advantage: United States of America.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has a global monopoly on currency. It literally can create out of thin air the world&#x2019;s most valuable financial asset. That ability has profound ramifications on the means which other central banks can employ to stay relevant in international trade. As Barry Eichengreen put it in his excellent book <em>Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International Monetary System</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries had to pony up $100 of actual goods in order to obtain one.&#x201D;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The international monetary order after the &#x201C;Nixon Shock&#x201D; was even more slanted in favor of the US. To underscore not only that a free-floating USD would not destroy the Bretton Woods regime but also the influence which the United States wielded at the Bretton Woods&#x2019; sister organizations, President Nixon&#x2019;s TV announcement ending dollar-gold convertibility made sure to include the words &#x201C;in full cooperation with the IMF.&#x201D; &#x1F602;&#x1F923;&#x1F602;</p>
<p>Why do I laugh?</p>
<p>Well let&#x2019;s just take a look at how that worked out.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmNkstRMiNFvmxSX5DSGAUwhsEkDB4iM7jhjcvAw9rv1n7/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And it doesn&#x2019;t end there. It just keeps on rolling. You can check for yourself at the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St Louis Fed website</a>. The Fed just keeps printing money. We are at nearly $14 trillion in current M3 money supply with no end of the inflation (and corresponding dollar devaluation) in sight.</p>
<p>So when I heard recently that Friedman had basically predicted the rise of Bitcoin, the preceding extensive backstory is why I took notice. has been the dream ever since we made up this thing called the internet.</p>
<p>Because if even old Milton <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/studentgroups/libertarians/issues/friedman-soc-resp-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#x201C;The Business of Business is to do Business&#x201D;</a> Friedman was waiting for this &#x201C;e-cash&#x201D;, I wonder why the Federal Reserve System didn&#x2019;t anticipate it.</p>
<p>And more importantly, why are we still waiting for an official regulatory opinion?</p>
<p>When it came to the Great Recession, we basically listened to Friedman. According to a 2011 report provided to the Federal Reserve Board, Edward Nelson stated, &#x201C;in important respects, the overall monetary and financial policy response to the crisis can be viewed as Friedman&#x2019;s monetary economics in practice.&#x201D; He also claimed that &#x201C;Friedman&#x2019;s recommendations for responding to a financial crisis largely lined up with the principal financial and monetary policy measures taken since 2007.&#x201D; </p>
<p>I mean if we are going to continue on with letting Friedman theories dictate our monetary policy, we should be letting all cryptocurrencies &#x201C;freely float&#x201D;, right? Friedman&#x2019;s emphasis on freedom as an <em>a priori</em> notion demands a light regulatory regime, no?</p>
<p>Or has the entire bureaucracy governing American monetary policy stopped listening to Milton Friedman?</p>
<p>Has the Fed forgotten its godfather?</p>
