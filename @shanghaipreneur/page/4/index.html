        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Anyone who has invested in the stock market in the past 43 years owes a debt of gratitude to John C. Bogle, the recently departed founder of The Vanguard Group.</p>
<p>Without him, retail investors might very well still be paying hundreds of dollars in commissions to buy individual stocks. Professional fund management would most likely be out of reach for all but the wealthiest investors.</p>
<p>As it is, fintech startups like <a href="https://share.robinhood.com/nicholk1042" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood</a> and Vanguard competitors like Fidelity have been forced to lead the industry even further down the road toward <a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1c0136vg4hb58/The-Next-Big-Fee-Trend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zero fee management</a>. That&#x2019;s because <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard</a> now has $5 trillion of assets under management (AUM), which puts a lot of pressure on their fund industry counterparts to reduce fees in an attempt to retain (and try to increase) their own AUM.</p>
<h2 id="How-did-Bogle-start-an-asset-management-revolution"><a href="#How-did-Bogle-start-an-asset-management-revolution" class="headerlink" title="How did Bogle start an asset management revolution?"></a>How did Bogle start an asset management revolution?</h2><p>As a professor and long-time academic myself, I am very proud to relate that Bogle&#x2019;s empire was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/17/investor-jack-bogle-founded-company-based-on-princeton-senior-thesis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded upon a well-researched and distinguised undergraduate research paper</a>. Yes, students, those assignments we give you that you think we don&#x2019;t even read can indeed lead to big opportunities!</p>
<p>Back in 1951, pretty much at the dawn of the mutual fund industry, Bogle&#x2019;s basic premise was that, in the long run, active investment managers do not beat the benchmark that they are given by which to measure their investing success. He reasoned that investors would therefore be better off investing in a broad basket of stocks that replicated the returns of the stock market overall.</p>
<p>He was right. Today, the exact number is certainly debated, but most people agree that <a href="https://www.aei.org/publication/more-evidence-that-its-very-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-95-of-financial-professionals-cant-do-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between 80% and 98% of active fund managers</a> fail to beat the market rate of return over the long term.</p>
<p>What&#x2019;s amazing is how he intuited that truth as a 21-year-old in an age without Big Data and massive computer processing power. Today, it&#x2019;s easy to pull up some returns data on a Bloomberg terminal and quickly build an investment thesis backed by all sorts of fancy graphs and pie charts. But to do that in the environment of 67 years ago is absolutely incredible.</p>
<p>And it <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-606/4606-3097.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got him a job</a> at the up-and-coming (and still going strong) Wellington Fund upon his graduation. </p>
<h2 id="What-does-Bogle&#x2019;s-philosophy-mean-to-today&#x2019;s-investors"><a href="#What-does-Bogle&#x2019;s-philosophy-mean-to-today&#x2019;s-investors" class="headerlink" title="What does Bogle&#x2019;s philosophy mean to today&#x2019;s investors?"></a>What does Bogle&#x2019;s philosophy mean to today&#x2019;s investors?</h2><p>As I tell my students when I talk about Mr. Bogle, the most important takeaway IMHO from Bogle&#x2019;s career is encapsulated in the following quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most fundamental decision of investing is asset allocation.<br>How much should you own in stock?<br>How much should you own in bonds?<br>How much should you own in cash reserves? . . .<br>That decision [has been shown to account] for an astonishing <strong>94%</strong> of the differences in total returns achieved by institutionally managed pension funds. . . .<br>There is no reason to believe that the same relationship does not also hold true for individual investors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ninety-four percent.</p>
<p>All based on just one simple investment decision.</p>

<p>So keep it simple.</p>
<p>And maybe you too one day can manage FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I just arrived back to my adopted hometown of Shanghai from a long month of holidays in my actual hometown back in South Carolina. As always when one is confronted by extended time in two so vastly different cultures, you start drawing up a list of contrasts and comparisons. Of course, the biggest one that my family and I noticed was, to put it simply, the sky. In the US, every single day that it didn&#x2019;t rain left you with this perfect blue sky. Pale, almost white near the horizon proceeding via some algorithmically perfect Gaussian blur through baby boy blue and into this dark, almost midnight, blue in the sky directly above you.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmP1mAyEavd8wvxvUBYqCF61Lo2uRmj6PSTE2LPnwyhJou/IMG_4651.JPG" alt="IMG_4651.JPG"></p>
<p>In more than 7 years spent in China, I have probably only seen this color sky a handful of times. My family and I know this. Expats know this. Well-travelled Chinese know this. Despite being hyper aware of this contrast, it still gets me every time. Unobscured by smog and pollution, </p>
<p>The sky&#x2026; is&#x2026; breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmR6NGYjfXoEZfgdmeQA1xNRED22cML8S8Hsw2GUjsDcre/IMG_7206.JPG" alt="IMG_7206.JPG"></p>
<p>It&#x2019;s just like that all the time, apparently.</p>
<p>We may have just been caught in an unfortunate comparison of timing. Shanghai has been relentlessly gray, cold, and rainy for most of the past 2 months. Apparently, the weather in the American South, where I&#x2019;m from, turned beautiful the day we arrived and began to turn cold the day of our departure. Sometimes you&#x2019;re just lucky like that.</p>
<p>But I&#x2019;ve been back to Stateside three times in the past 2 years and this insight is my #1 takeaway. And like I said, this is despite the fact that I <em>know</em>, am <em>aware</em>, and <em>expect</em> there to be this difference. This, to me, makes this realization all the more amazing.</p>
<p>I definitely don&#x2019;t remember having this impression as a kid growing up. The blue of the sky was just what blue was to me then. These days my two-year-old drives home the contrast. For the first week we were in America, every time we walked outside she enthusiastically exclaimed, &#x201C;<em>Niao</em>, <em>niao</em>, <em>niao</em>!&#x201D; whenever she saw a bird, and &#x201C;<em>Laoshu</em>, <em>shu</em>, <em>shu</em>,&#x201D; every time she saw a squirrel. (Yeah, I know <em>laoshu</em> means &#x201C;rat&#x201D; but, really, a squirrel is just a rat with a bushy tail, so my kid isn&#x2019;t exactly wrong. &#x1F61D;)</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s almost like she had never seen them before. In Shanghai, we just don&#x2019;t have those things. Or they&#x2019;re so rare that seeing them be so common in another place is just like a revelation to a kid.</p>
<p>Don&#x2019;t get me wrong. We love Shanghai. We love China.</p>
<p>But you can&#x2019;t help what your (and your child&#x2019;s) natural reactions are. And among the many obvious cultural and natural differences between the US and China, this response to the relative environmental conditions of each place is by far the biggest difference we see.</p>
<p>To highlight that contrast, here is what it looks like outside my window today:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUy1NkLsrREv6ogHFmUpND9UNAYWT3TPAo78U3xsArAs3/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The only blue we&#x2019;re likely to see this winter in Shanghai will be the blue we see in the undies our neighbors hang out to dry on the clothesline.</p>

            <p><strong>Land. They ain&#x2019;t making any more of it, they say.</strong></p>
<p>Nevermind that they are. I&#x2019;m pretty sure that Singapore and the Netherlands are about half sitting on man-made islands. Weird flat things I know where the water imperceptibly melts off into the land. You can barely tell whether you&#x2019;re sitting on land or on water. The maps on your phone don&#x2019;t know either. But, you know, that&#x2019;s what they say.</p>
<p><strong>Give me land, give me land. If you really care for me, darling, you will give me territory, they say.</strong></p>
<p>That&#x2019;s another land quote that is always floating around out there. I wish a woman would tell me to give her land. Gosh, I&#x2019;d probably get married all over again if I ever heard this request. It&#x2019;s just so. reasonable. I love it. But that&#x2019;s actually what some people say when they say, &#x201C;They say&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>The land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it&#x2019;s the only thing that lasts.</strong></p>
<p>Being that I am a Southern gentleman, I felt obliged to include this little nugget from <em>Gone With the Wind</em>&#x2019;s Scarlet O&#x2019;Hara. She was definitely a woman you wouldn&#x2019;t mind giving some land to.</p>
<p>Land is a way of life in the American South and has been ever since some royal entrepreneurs came across the pond and started clearing forest and planting crops. They may have got a little lazy there for a bit, but I think at least regarding land they seem to have gotten that right.</p>

<p>Most people probably think that it would be somewhat cheap.</p>
<p>But you know what <em>they</em> say,</p>

        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Recently, much of the &#x201C;brain hash&#x201D; in the blockchain industry has been devoted to the demise of ICOs (initial coin offerings) and the seemingly inevitable rise of STOs (security token offerings) that is to come in the as-yet-undeterminable time frame of &#x201C;some time soon.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Great ICO Bust of 2018 has been largely blamed on what is essentially the file format of the majority of the tokens that were sold in ICOs to raise funds for projects. It has gotten to the point where the very concept of utility tokens has come under fire. Many pundits now claim that the utility token is dead and will never rise again. My favorite new crypto jargon these days is <a href="https://tokeneconomy.co/futility-tokens-a-utility-based-post-mortem-d7b1712a5a4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">futility token</a>.</p>
<p>However, correlation is not always causation. Utility tokens did not cause the collapse of the crypto markets this year. Insider trading, outright scams, the lack of <a href="https://steemit.com/investing/@shanghaipreneur/on-investment-risk-and-investor-psychology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proper risk management</a>, the inevitable unwinding of a hype cycle, the Tether hypothesis, the impact of bitcoin futures, and more&#x2026; All of these reasons are more obvious and more direct causes of the approximate 90% collapse in prices across the board for all cryptographic assets seen in 2018. Increasingly, however, especially within the context of the stock market&#x2019;s recent Santa Claus Folly, I&#x2019;m leaning more and more towards the <a href="https://twitter.com/_jillruth/status/1069666389533675520?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#x201C;canary in a coal mine&#x201D; scenario</a>. If that is indeed the case, then there was nothing any one blockchain person or entity could have done to avoid it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUfF1Hacnq9ri7L6nLc8EmFW2FVQkgsXz5eiunEEkYixx/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s not blame the messenger though. In this environment, that&#x2019;s all the poor little utility token was - a fleet-footed Pheidippides warning us all to take off our rose-colored glasses and start to clean house before digital tokenized assets on the blockchain become a legitimate asset class warranting a significant part in investor portfolios all over the world. And if you buy into the &#x201C;canary&#x201D; argument, you&#x2019;d have to thank bitcoin for warning us all to get our financial asset portfolio &#x201C;ducks in a row&#x201D; before the shit truly hit the fan.</p>
<p>But let&#x2019;s be very clear about the distinction between utility tokens and security tokens going forward. <strong>Security tokens are great, but by no means are they revolutionary.</strong></p>
<p>Utility tokens, on the other hand, still have the capacity to reshape the digital world we live in for the better of all mankind. Security tokens, in what will most likely be their most prevalent use case, are basically just digital stock certificates.</p>
<p>Cool and useful? Yes. Revolutionary? No.</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t know. You tell me. But I&#x2019;m thinking that might be an opinion that is a little bit out of tune with the rest of the industry these days. So please allow me to explain.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Are-Utility-Tokens-Still-So-Important"><a href="#Why-Are-Utility-Tokens-Still-So-Important" class="headerlink" title="Why Are Utility Tokens Still So Important?"></a>Why Are Utility Tokens Still So Important?</h1><p>Utility tokens offer the hope of redefining the way ownership of a network works forever. In today&#x2019;s equity-based environment, the gains due to the <em>private</em> ownership of a successful <em>closed</em> network or platform business accrue solely to the equity holders. Users are subject to monopoly pricing power and at-times authoritarian regulation.</p>
<p><strong>Closed network ecosystems do not maximize economic value.</strong><br>Closed network ecosystems almost always allow too much power to accumulate to one participant, eventually that will be to a single node in the network. There are <em>users</em> and there are <em>owners</em> and never the twain shall meet. A user may use that platform in order to transact as either a platform buyer or a platform seller. But in either case, they are a platform <em>user</em> that endeavors to exploit said platform for their own economic benefit by engaging in economic activity, the profit from which mostly accrues to the platform <em>owner</em>, though there may be just enough of a &#x201C;taste&#x201D; provided to the <em>user</em> to keep them engaged.</p>
<p>This type of closed system incentivizes the platform <em>users</em> to engage solely in pure profit-seeking behavior. However, in game theoretical terms, because platform <em>owners</em> must also make this base assumption, they must also engage in profit-seeking behavior, the result of which, in the long run, hampers the growth of network activity. In short, the economic incentives are not the same for a platform <em>user</em> as they are for a platform <em>owner</em>. This inequity results in massive economic inefficiency. Thus, closed network ecosystems do not maximize economic value, but they can maximize it for the one player in the ecosystem that may achieve monopoly status.</p>
<p>At the very least, growth is sacrificed for control. Perhaps the most famous example of a monopoly owner of a closed network system is the famous  <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/browser-wars-netscape-internet-explorer.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Browser Wars</a> of 1995 to 2001. In this case, Microsoft exerted its control over the ecosystem to the detriment of the ecosystem&#x2019;s growth but to the benefit of the monopoly owner, Microsoft.<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbnCpQu6WKaCMEaBbhUfK8xAzxzjRguNY5Pu2gbTsz2Km/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this lockdown dragout battle from the Internet Bubble era, the open-source browser software Netscape Navigator held an IPO, almost immediately tripling its valuation to $2 billion. But the company still lacked the cash reserves and OS domination of rival Microsoft. Thus, when Microsoft introduced a browser of its own, the even-to-this-very-day notoriously flawed Internet Explorer, Netscape despite having a superior product of its own, eventually could not compete against its pre-installed and freely distributed browser competitor.</p>
<p>Why? Microsoft operated its own <strong>closed network ecosystem</strong>, the Windows operating system (OS). That OS commanded more than 90% of the pre-install market for newly manufactured computers. Basically, they controlled what software got bundled onto PCs without actually having to produce those new machines themselves. As you would expect, the margins were redonkulous. However, this practice would quickly land Bill Gates&#x2019; company in hot water with the Department of Justice and a protracted five-year-long battle with superlawyer <a href="https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/david-boies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Boies</a> in one of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-microsofts-antitrust-case-teaches-us-about-silicon-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most famous anti-trust cases</a> in the history of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmWTMcxRv8BWE6JofdoajbzKkxDhw8xAiWsRukajsFpujs/image.png" alt=""><br><a href="http://wikieducator.org/Internet_%26_Web_development_(2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a>/Course_materials/Overview/Web_Browsers)</p>
<p>The result was a relatively swift kill by IE over Navigator. The monopolistic interest had no interest in letting a valuable business (the internet browser) camping out and flourishing in its pre-existing monopoly ecosystem (the Windows operating system).</p>
<p>We see these kinds of epic struggles over market share every once in a while in our technology cycle-driven lives. The last one I remember clearly was the argument surrounding the struggle between China, a country that basically owns its telecommunications industry via a triumvirate of nationalized behemoths, and Tencent, a fast-growing Chinese tech firm that plays by the Party rules in order to safeguard its status as &#x201C;national champion&#x201D; of IT and all that is not e-commerce in the Chinese Web 2.0. Back in 2011, when its now flagship app WeChat had just been launched, it siphoned off a key piece of revenue for the closed network operators of China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom. They had been used to billions of dollars in annual revenue from SMS fees. Yes, that arcane practice of charging per text (or even per character!) to people who want to communicate with one another. But WeChat was about to end that game with its over-the-top (OTT) network services.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVQBL5S61ZSqNgviM7fhg8HATyVSG8mqWFJ6My6fDzPLM/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When WeChat first came on the scene, the Chinese government&#x2019;s telecom triopoly tried to force Tencent to pay compensation for this displacement of revenue. In the end, the effort stalled and the Chinese telecom industry vowed to reorganize as a more efficient pseduo-monopoly, realizing that the 4G, and soon to be 5G, closed networks that they operated would serve as the backbone for all future tech innovation in China. If those Chinese telecoms were not state-owned enterprises (SOE), and thus willing to operate within the bounds of what&#x2019;s best for the country&#x2019;s economy (at least some of the time) rather than what&#x2019;s best for their company, rest assured that they would not have given up such a battle so quietly. See AT&amp;T, its forced breakup, and eventual reassembly for an example of how a more purely capitalist enterprise would have responded.</p>
<p>An example of how capitalist monopolies in control of closed network systems work to deter innovation that Western readers might be more familiar with is the classic story of <a href="https://www.zynga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zynga</a> versus Facebook.</p>
<p>With its flagship game <strong>Farmville</strong>, this online gaming startup took advantage of an API Facebook initially released in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/how-zynga-went-from-social-gaming-powerhouse-to-has-been/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 2007</a>. Ironically, the API had initially been a part of Mark Zuckerberg&#x2019;s kill move on <a href="https://myspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Myspace</a>. Hey, I just went to check and see if Myspace still had a website and, yep, it does! Isn&#x2019;t that amazing?</p>
<p>After Zynga <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/how-zynga-went-from-social-gaming-powerhouse-to-has-been/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growth hacked</a> its way to something like 100 million DAUs (daily active users), Facebook aggressively moved to cut off the fuel that fed Zynga&#x2019;s growth after negotiations broke down after the implementation of Facebook Credits. Eventually, however, Facebook would reduce the amount of insidious messages on its platform by 95%, in the name of <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1721252/how-facebook-killed-most-spam-using-smart-filters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fighting spam</a>, but it could just as well be characterized as starving Zynga of potential new users. The software company with the cute bulldog logo almost starved to death.</p>
<p>With a post-IPO peak valuation of nearly $13 billion in 2012, Zynga (ZNGA) trades today at a little less than $3.5 billion, which is still about double the value it fetched at its all-time low back in early 2016. Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) traded at its all-time low in 2012, at around a $50 billion market capitalization. Earlier this year, in 2018, FB traded at an all-time high of over $600 billion.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ll just leave those numbers right here again. ZNGA - $3 B; FB - $600 B.</p>
<p>I can&#x2019;t think of a better argument than that for opting to support the development of open network economies. Just think of how much better we could have made <em>Farmville</em> if only Facebook would have let us innovate! Well, I realize that my last sentence might not exactly persuade you of my argument, but i hope you get my meaning.</p>
<p>The stories of Microsoft &amp; Netscape, Facebook &amp; Zynga, as well as the anti-story of China Mobile &amp; WeChat all illustrate why closed network economic systems are so dangerous. And why the growth of open-architecture network systems, driven by utility token adoption, is so god damn important.</p>
<p>In contrast to the easily exploitable &#x201C;walled garden&#x201D; approach to network economics, a well-designed and well-operated open utility token economy creates a third class of economic actor, a <em>user-owner</em> if you will, to add to the previously mentioned classes of <em>user</em> and <em>owner</em>. In theory, such a <em>user-owner</em> would engage in economic behavior that would emphasize long term returns over short term. Introducing this economic actor into an economic system should help to balance the inherently short-term nature of the user/owner dialectic. In other words, giving early adopters some &#x201C;skin in the game&#x201D; while simultaneously diluting the power of the capitalist technocrats (&#x201C;You gotta have someone to pay for it and someone to build it!&#x201D;) at the heart of any network economy may in fact be the key to solving a whole host of technological issues related to cybersecurity, efficiency, and asset monetization.</p>
<p>The friction between <em>owner</em> and <em>user</em> that is everpresent in a closed network economy just isn&#x2019;t there in an open network economic ecosystem. In addition to injecting into the system an increasing amount of hybrid economic actors with stabilizing long-term economic time horizons, open token networks remove this friction by aligning all network participants to work together toward two common goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>the growth of the network and</li>
<li>the appreciation of the token.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, they offer society the best chance to resist the over accumulation, or centralization, of power at any one particular node in an emerging economic ecosystem.</p>
<p>So please don&#x2019;t <em>pooh-pooh</em> on utility tokens (UT) any more than you have to. They are not the problem. Assuredly, there are going to be some UTs that will emerge from this crypto winter that become very, very valuable. Other UTs will, inevitably, die. But they won&#x2019;t have died because the <em>concept</em> of the utility token is inherently flawed. They will have died because the <em>design</em> of their particular utility token was flawed.</p>
<p>In the end, UTs may only represent future access to a company&#x2019;s networked product or network service (not equity). But given that <a href="https://www.nfx.com/post/70-percent-value-network-effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70% of tech value</a> is driven by <a href="https://medium.com/evergreen-business-weekly/the-power-of-network-effects-why-they-make-such-valuable-companies-and-how-to-harness-them-5d3fbc3659f8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">network effects</a>, that could easily become a very valuable access token <em>in the long run</em>.</p>
<p>UTs are not designed as investments and they should never have been even confused with securities. They are simply the fuel to engage in transactions on a specific network. Therefore, they should be exempt from securities laws. Though, in effect, they are a form of regulation upon their respective networks in and of themselves, should governments believe that UTs still deserve regulation, they could work towards a body of legislation specific to the nuances of utility tokens and not try to shoehorn them into existing regulatory policy. But these things take time, of course.</p>
<p>In short, security tokens (STs) are great, but they aren&#x2019;t the bee&#x2019;s knees like utility tokens have the potential to be. STs may represent equity in a company or some other asset and offer many substantial benefits to tokenholders. There are a lot of reasons to like them (which I will reserve for another post). But let&#x2019;s make this clear:</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>In China, there is a whole subindustry of &#x201C;training teachers&#x201D; (&#x57F9;&#x8BAD;&#x8001;&#x5E08;) that charge exorbitant fees in order to teach you how to be successful. Obviously, if they were actually successful, they wouldn&#x2019;t be charging you money to teach you how to be successful. But that&#x2019;s beside the point! They traffic in the hopes and dreams of the lower middle class aspirational Chinese citizen. Think of them as worse Asian versions of Tony Robbins.</p>
<p>Well, I can&#x2019;t afford to pay these guys the more than 200,000 CNY that they command from the <em>laobaixing</em> (&#x8001;&#x767E;&#x59D3;) for them to be my mentor. So I&#x2019;ve taken the habit of tracking down my own mentors in life. I will be presenting my studies of those characters periodically here on my blog. I call it:</p>
<h1 id="CASES-IN-SUCCESS"><a href="#CASES-IN-SUCCESS" class="headerlink" title="CASES IN SUCCESS"></a>CASES IN SUCCESS</h1><p>The first virtual mentor I will present is a guy most everyone will know through his company - Amazon, one of two companies to have commanded a $1 trillion valuation at some point. More interestingly, at least to me, is the fact that after the Dot Com Bubble in 2000, AMZN shares traded down more than 90% after reaching a high of more than $100 during one of investment&#x2019;s great speculative bubbles. At that time, many businessmen would have been disappointed and closed down shop.</p>
<p>But the founder and CEO of Amazon persisted. This year his stock has seen a record high of more than $2050 and currently trades at $1663. <strong>Are you reading this out there, Crypto World?</strong> The lesson here is simple.</p>
<h1 id="Keep-thinking-Keep-building"><a href="#Keep-thinking-Keep-building" class="headerlink" title="Keep thinking. Keep building."></a>Keep thinking. Keep building.</h1><p>Don&#x2019;t worry about the price the market accords to your company. Worry about the value YOU and YOUR EMPLOYEES bring to your company. In the long run, the latter is what&#x2019;s important. Never the former.</p>
<p>And now without further ado, the story of Jeff Bezos. In 527 words.</p>
<p>Come on! We&#x2019;re trying to learn the habits of success here. Not write a biography!</p>

<p>Jeff Bezos is an Internet pioneer. He founded Amazon, a technology-driven e-commerce website. In the 2016 version of the Forbes 400 ranking of top billionaires, he was the second wealthiest American. Microsoft&#x2019;s Bill Gates is the only American more wealthy than Mr. Bezos. This retailer early on established a goal to be &#x201C;the world&#x2019;s most customer-centric company.&#x201D; To that end, Amazon has been wildly successful.</p>
<p>He graduated summa cum laude from Princeton in 1986. Afterwards, Bezos held a variety of roles on Wall Street. His first jobs were as an engineer and computer scientist. In 1994, he read a statistic stating that Web usage was growing at an annual rate of 2300 percent. The &#x201C;gold rush&#x201D; of the Internet&#x2019;s early days called to him. He promptly quit his respected job at a quantitative hedge fund. He then drove across the country to begin his life as a Seattle entrepreneur. He wrote the business plan en route.</p>
<p>He based his decision to begin his startup on a &#x201C;regret minimization framework.&#x201D; He asked himself a set of two simple questions. Would he regret having tried and failed? No. Would he regret having not tried? Always. Therefore, Amazon.com was born.</p>

<p><em>This iconic picture is lifted from a</em> 60 Minutes <em>piece done on Amazon in 1999.</em></p>
<p>Amazon started at the dawn of the Dot-Com Boom era (1995-2000). After moving his family out West, Bezos spent a year preparing to launch his company. He opened a small office, recruited talent, and established vendor relationships. Mostly, however, he spent a year working on complex software infrastructure. Amazon.com launched in July 1995. The company was started with $300,000 of seed capital from his parents (almost their entire life savings) and then later $1 million from 20 angel investors.</p>
<p>Initially, the online platform focused exclusively on books. Why books? Bezos believed that books were the &#x201C;first best&#x201D; products to use in an e-commerce business. They were flat and easy to ship. The category also offers a diverse array of similar products. These characteristics are perfectly suited to the sophisticated management only available through a computer database. There are millions of books in print at any given time. It is impossible for a bricks-and-mortar retail bookstore to offer all of these titles at once. Amazon can at least come close to this ideal.</p>

<p>In the first 30 days of its existence, Amazon received orders from all 50 states and 45 countries. Having started with a distribution center the size of a one-car garage, the company was obviously unprepared for this rush of orders. It quickly moved to a two thousand square foot concrete warehouse. It has been cramped for space ever since. Today, Bezos&#x2019; $370 billion company is the largest retailer in the world.</p>
<p>How can we aspire to be as successful as Mr. Bezos? First, you should &#x201C;make sure you are focused on something you are passionate about.&#x201D; Another important factor is your perspective on risk. Because &#x201C;risk is a necessary component of progress,&#x201D; a company must &#x201C;<strong>use its precious startup funds to systematically eliminate risk</strong>.&#x201D; Lastly, experimentation is key. You have to keep trying until you find the right mix of strategic elements that wholly satisfy your customers.</p>

            <p>Today I want to step away from cryptocurrency and investing and highlight/update a bit one of my favorite pieces I&#x2019;ve written in the past few years. Before I found Steemit, I wrote extensively on <a href="https://www.quora.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quora</a>. I think it was because they used this cryptoeconomic-like reward system, which they have now abandoned. I never understood why. It, like Steemit and Reddit, rewarded you for posting stuff that other people upvoted. As you accumulated more Quora points, you got more sway in the ecosystem. Hey! It&#x2019;s better than Facebook, where you post every intimate thing for free and get nothing in return but spam and political trickery. If you&#x2019;re interested in reading the <a href="https://shanghaipreneur.quora.com/Book-Review-Ghost-Cities-of-China-2015-by-Wade-Shepard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original book review</a>, that&#x2019;s the link. Here we go. Let&#x2019;s start with a little picture I took while wandering around Nanjing.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYHPYA23VWLpEtHCYJENBfpJbk212kt7JVfD7ctRog49c/image.png" alt=""><br><em>A recent picture of Nanjing being rebuilt.</em></p>
<p>Ever since I moved to China in 2011, I have wanted to read a book like Wade Shepard&#x2019;s <em>Ghost Cities of China: The Story of Cities Without People</em> <em>in the World&#x2019;s Most Populated Country</em>, published by <a href="https://www.zedbooks.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zed Books</a> in 2015. Since living these past six years in Beijing and Shanghai, I have developed the habit of going on long, meandering walks through unfamiliar parts of the city. During these excursions, I quickly noticed that the older, decaying communities near where I lived, the very enclaves that gave my adopted hometowns their unique character, often transformed into piles of rubble without notice.</p>
<p>I was left to wonder&#x2026; Where did that noodle shop go?</p>
<p>What happened to that great <em>jianbing</em> guy?</p>
<p>How about those kids that were playing in the street just last week?</p>
<p>Sometimes in the week after the destruction of an urban village, masons would build a wall around the newly &#x201C;freed&#x201D; land. Sometimes the lot just lied in ruin for months. And sometimes construction workers and equipment immediately swooped in and began the process of transmogrification into vertical gray-black office spires. White collar workers then spent their day there, perhaps grabbing a coffee at lunch in the overpriced branded cafe on the first floor, and vacated the premises at the end of the business day in favor of apartments in newly built skyscraper boxes on some other newly &#x201C;freed&#x201D; land plot, perhaps over an hour or two away in the suburbs. A neighborhood that once teemed with activity at all times of the day and night was left eerily empty in the dark.</p>
<p>What is the logic behind this process?</p>
<p>I knew that Chinese real estate was ridiculously expensive, but never quite grasped all of the complex machinations that facilitated its development from communal property into a quasi-private form of individual financial asset for the <em>laobaixing</em>. Thankfully, Wade Shepard provides a thorough primer on the subject. Because approximately one-fifth of China&#x2019;s GDP is related to the real estate industry, anyone interested in the contemporary Chinese economy should read this thoroughly entertaining and highly informative book.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZVJ14K5fzWt4jLiLttvpWHPNW1tiDoVERqMcTboCmp5f/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Wade Shepard is an experienced freelance journalist. His crisp and clean writing style reflects years on the beat for <em>Forbes</em>, <em>South China Morning Post</em>, and countless other reputable sources. The book is based on two-plus years of research, travel, and interviews with experts and people on the ground. His clear, no-nonsense approach is a welcome reprieve for this professor, who probably reads too many academic articles and dissertations converted for publication.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/ghost-cities-of-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Ghost Cities</em></a> comes in at just over 200 pages and is comprised of ten mostly narrative-based chapters. The first and last chapters serve as introduction and conclusion without being termed as such.</p>
<p>Chapters 2 through 9 address the variety of topics needed to understand the unprecedented and uniquely Chinese phenomenon of large-scale urbanization. &#x201C;Clearing the Land&#x201D; (Chapter 2) describes the nature and necessity of local government land sales to private developers. Some cities are so desperate for the cash and recognition that accompany GDP growth that they have literally moved mountains in order to create higher-value marketable land. &#x201C;Powering the New China&#x201D; (Chapter 8) explains the monumental task of providing electricity to one billion urban dwellers. Though China is poised to become a leader in alternative energy for decades to come, it has an insatiable demand that dictates a long-term reliance on dirty coal power as well. By 2030, the country will have installed over 2,500 gigawatts of annual electricity supply production - an installed base that is approximately two-and-a-half times that of the United States.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZzuzxvvFzGEojTjmJMtTKqTZEKQUMnFEk6bYWxR7rRhF/image.png" alt=""><br><em>The first time I read about Chinese &#x201C;ghost cities&#x201D; was in the <a href="http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1975397,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seminal Time photo essay</a> where this photo comes from, about Ordos&#x2019; new Kangbashi district in Inner Mongolia, which ironically is where Bitmain would later set up huge bitcoin mines.</em></p>
<p>Other chapters describe in detail the nature of the &#x201C;ghost city&#x201D; appellation so eagerly employed by Western media outlets like <em>60 Minutes</em>, <em>Business Insider</em>, and <em>Time</em>. In fact, Shepard successfully argues that the term &#x201C;ghost city&#x201D; itself is a misnomer. With connotations inherited from America&#x2019;s old Wild West, it implies the depopulation of a formerly thriving center of commerce.</p>
<p>When you say <a href="http://www.countryliving.com/life/travel/g2665/spookiest-ghost-towns-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#x201C;ghost city&#x201D; in America</a>, thoughts turn to old mining towns, abandoned Catskills mountaintop resorts, and strip hotels along Route 66.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmRBWPmm9cFPmVeyJBFtKoFTaSCfCQFDyc363uAhW3wVzV/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But the character of &#x201C;ghost cities&#x201D; in China is exactly the opposite. As you can see in the <em>Time</em> photo essay, a Chinese &#x201C;ghost city&#x201D; is not an ancient relic, but rather a modern dream that represents the hope of things to come.</p>
<p>In this sense, the Western media offers a criticism that is woefully misplaced. Zhengdong New District in Zhengzhou, Nanhui in Shanghai, Tianjin&#x2019;s Ecocity, and the previously mentioned deserted desert district Ordos Kangbashi have all seen millions of people inhabit these areas after their embarrassing &#x201C;ghost city&#x201D; exposure. If you pause to think about it for just a second, that is the way it <em>should</em> work. These cities are built in anticipation of a flood of new residents. They are not going to reach capacity in a year. They probably will not even reach capacity in a decade.</p>
<p>In a country where only one-fifth of its 1.4 billion people lived in cities at the beginning of Deng Xiaoping&#x2019;s grand hybrid capitalist experiment and which has literally only just reached the halfway point in its goal of having one billion urban citizens by 2050, how else is this process going to work? This <em>Field of Dreams</em> &#x201C;build it and they will come&#x201D; philosophy is absolutely necessary. It may look awfully strange to Western observers, but those G20 citizens just do not live in a country that has to manage 1.4 billion people.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmd5AyGmYEomj6bj2i2JS7gFj9ZbRcTzCxNKXvyckaafu2/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Party perceives Chinese urbanization as a priority for a variety of reasons. The primary reason is quite simple. Urban dwellers consume more. Thus, they contribute significantly more to GDP in the long run than self-sufficient farmers. In the short run, permanent construction offers a temporary super boost to GDP. Shepard lists a variety of other reasons as well. Another reason perhaps is to limit the chance of rural revolt by reversing the Mao maxim &#x201C;the countryside surrounds the city.&#x201D; In future China, it is clear that &#x201C;the city surrounds the countryside&#x201D; (90). Thus, for ambitious Party leaders, rapid urban development is a good way to earn a promotion.</p>
<p>This immutable aspect of human nature - the desire to succeed in one&#x2019;s individual career - explains a lot about the nature of China&#x2019;s local debt problem. Indeed, various sources cite Chinese net debt (not only from government sources but also from private companies as well) as more than <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0c7ecae2-8cfb-11e8-bb8f-a6a2f7bca546" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$36 trillion</a>. The success of temporary city leaders increasingly relies on the undertaking of grandiose projects like the creation of endless central business districts, shopping malls, and Western-style suburbs. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQB3U1uop6HDtRpxnmKXF83zAUHF43VDhKr6UEAsD345P/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These projects require extensive financing, forcing cities to become ever more dependent on land sales for income to service these massive debts. But Shepard points out what should be obvious to Western China doomsayers like Gordon Chang, who wrote <em>The Coming Collapse of China</em>&#x2026; in 2001! Party-operated locales mostly owe debt to Party-operated financial institutions. These same banks and funds have consistently shown a willingness to restructure this debt to accommodate the successful realization of government goals.</p>
<p>Not all of these new infrastructure investments are sunk cost leviathans. They do earn money. For example, the current Prime Minister Li Keqiang initiated a $25.8 billion investment in Zhengzhou&#x2019;s Zhengdong New District in 2003 (48). However, in a scant ten years later, its economy was growing at a healthy clip - around 13% - and already returning $1.22 billion in annual tax revenues to Beijing (55). For economists like myself who prefer to take the long-term view, that&#x2019;s a pretty healthy return on investment! Aside from Shenzhen and Shanghai&#x2019;s Pudong District, the classic examples of Chinese development success, this book provides many examples of flourishing urban planning. These type of projects will probably earn fine returns in first-tier cities, in what is called <em>BeiShangGuang</em> (meaning Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong province supercities Guangzhou and Shenzhen). But realizing acceptable rates of return on investments in third-tier cities and below is looking increasingly questionable.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmc2aNvAfDCAbVGDR3JXd329JK8pnzcP1tJxytu1mnqaXZ/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The only aspect of this book that I found fault with was the author&#x2019;s claim that the Chinese &#x201C;housing market is readjusting and topping out&#x201D; (204). In 2016, Chinese real estate prices increased an average of <a href="http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Asia/china/Price-History" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19% nationwide</a>. In 2018, we are at even higher price levels in first-tier cities, but have started to see significant price declines in less desirable parts of the country. So my main criticism of <em>Ghost Cities</em> may well yet be proven unfounded. But even if real estate prices remain elevated, that does not disprove the main thesis of Shepard&#x2019;s outstanding book.</p>
<p>With just a little patience, most but probably not all of China&#x2019;s &#x201C;ghost cities&#x201D; will likely be accretive to GDP and contribute to the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1821728306" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#x201C;grand strategy&#x201D;</a> of Chinese leadership. Sadly, the West often lacks these qualities - the ability to think in decades instead of quarters, the ability to execute and complete large-scale projects - when it comes to finance and economics. Yeah, it looks like China may soon face its first significant economic correction since <em>kaifang</em> but this is merely representative of the cyclical nature of capitalism and should not merit a full-throated condemnation of leadership.</p>
<p>At least, that&#x2019;s what I thought at the beginning of 2017 and what I still believe to be true, in the long run at least, here at the end of 2018.</p>
<p>A little &#x201C;boots on the ground&#x201D; perspective goes a long way.</p>
