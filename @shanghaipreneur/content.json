Sure, crypto markets right now are “boring”… But that’s actually great! More on that later… But come on, what’s “boring” about a market where most investors are up 3x-4x in the manner of a couple of months? There are some obvious and unavoidable calendar reasons for this recent “boring” crypto market. But let’s take a look in this post at just the technical side of analyzing price movements. Here we have a screenshot from our favorite CMC screen - the total market cap of the global crypto market. Not bad! We’re almost triple from where we were 3 months ago. Yeah, we were at one brief point more than quadruple up in the past 3 months. But dems da breaks. It’s like that. But I’m really not worried. And I’ll show you why in this next image: Here we have a long-term support line for the global crypto markets. As long as we are bobbing along this line, with continually slightly higher lows at low volume, when trading volume does reappear on the crypto markets, most likely after the conclusion of Lunar New Year festivities in East Asia - coincidentally home to most of the world’s crypto trading volume - we are likely to see a positive impact on the global crypto market cap This page is synchronized from the post: Cryptocurrency Global Market Cap Technical Analysis (with CHARTS!!!) document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@shanghaipreneur/cryptocurrency-global-market-cap-technical-analysis-with-charts/"},{"title":"The Next Big Political Showdown Has Nothing to do with North Korea. It's Trump v. The Amazonopoly!","text":"Amazon is an e-commerce behemoth, a sprawling media empire, an airport, soon a luxury grocery store… No wonder Jeff Bezos was officially the richest man in the world for maybe 24 hours. Though he is now an unceremonious #2, he still gets President Trump fired up. Maybe the Great Coiffed One does not threaten the “fury” like he does with No. 3 Fat over in the Hermit Kingdom, but Trump does on occasion get himself in a tizzy over the “Amazon Washington Post.” And though, yes, Bezos’ company has nothing technically to do with Bezos’ newspaper, it’s probably time that we officially begin the watch for this administration’s high-profile anti-trust investigation into the purveyors of Prime entertainment and online products. Remember the last time this happened? The United States v. Microsoft Corp. basically forced the company run by the world’s then-richest man to stand still for a decade. On the day the settlement was proposed on Nov 2. 2001, MSFT traded at $27 per share. When the settlement decree finally expired, unenforced, it traded at $25. During Microsoft’s lost decade, the company missed out on massive opportunities in search, e-commerce, smart phones and social media. Would Bill Gates’ company have acted differently without the specter of anti-trust action perpetually hanging over it? Absolutely. Michael Cusumano, a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management in 2011, told the Seattle Times, “Since the antitrust suit, they have become much more cautious and much less aggressive… They’re afraid, it seems. Whether it’s antitrust in U.S. or in Europe, they seem to be slowly reacting to the world around them, rather than trying to get in there fast.” During the period dominated by potential anti-trust legislation, Gates would broker a deal to save Apple. From a purely business standpoint, this move made no sense. But taking into account the anti-trust concerns, Gates felt compelled to make a $150 million investment in Apple preferred shares. The cash infusion would save Apple from bankruptcy and preserve a viable competitor to Microsoft. Apple then went on to reinvent the music and cellphone industries. Microsoft stuck to its knitting, selling operating systems and office software and not much else. What else could it do? If Amazon faced anti-trust action, would they be able to continue their aggressive expansion into nearly every sector of the US economy? Could they do much more than Microsoft did? There is no love lost between Donald Trump and Jeff Bezos. Campaign Trump warned us that Amazon has “a huge antitrust problem.” Is it possible that a new attorney general to replace the neutered Jeff Sessions would be encouraged to go after Bezos’ pride and joy? Could Trump just wake up one morning and feel like doing it and do it? The first step may occur when Democrats in the Senate bluster over Amazonopoly’s proposed Whole Foods acquisition. U.S. Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) penned a letter to the House Judiciary Committee requesting hearings on Amazon’s Whole Foods acquisition. He claims that the deal is another in a long line of mergers that have “decreased wages and resulted in gross inequality in the workplace.” “Amazon’s proposed acquisition of Whole Foods raises important questions concerning competition policy, such as how the transaction will affect the future of retail grocery stores, whether platform dominance impedes innovation, and if the antitrust laws are working effectively to ensure economic opportunity, choice and low prices for American families,” Cicilline wrote. Another arrow in the anti-trust quiver is Amazon’s appetite for airports. In January, Amazon announced a $1.5 billion investment in Northern Kentucky to develop its own air cargo hub. The lease is for acreage nearly one-and-a-half times FedEx’s headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee. There are also rumors that Amazon may buy an airport in Germany. Wait… so Amazon is trying to put how many companies out of business? At some point, government regulators have to ask, “How is having all of these disparate assets under one corporate umbrella not violate some or all of the extant anti-trust statutes?” I’m not a lawyer. But I can read the legal writing on the wall. Amazonopoly is happening right before our eyes. Eventually, some lawmaker or regulator is going to want to make a name for themselves by going after the richest guy in the world and his leviathan company. It is here that Amazon’s strategy will backfire. As opposed to the rising Asian internet super-conglomerates like Alibaba, Softbank, and Tencent, which emphasize complex cross-ownership structures in their capital accumulation, AMZN prefers to wholly own and operate all of its various operations and subsidiaries.

RaiBlocks - the crypto you never really knew what exactly it was about… Did they just forget to put an L in the name? Is it like a railroad blockchain project?

You’d be thinking of NEO, which concluded its rebrand from AntShares on, of course, 8-8-17. The significance there being that NEO is THE China coin and Chinese people are just obsessed with 8s. I mean, they even arranged to host the Summer Olympics just so they could start the ceremony exactly at 8:08 pm on 8-8-08. It’s true. So how did NEO do since the rebrand? Oh, I’d say not bad. At its high of near $200 per coin, NEO returned nearly 10x since its rebrand. At today’s prices of around $130 per coin, that’s still a healthy six-bagger IN LESS THAN HALF A YEAR.

If I am trying to think like Warren Buffett, I might console myself with the old Rothschild quote to only “buy when there’s blood in the streets.” Buffett, however, in his old folksy way toned that down a bit. His famous quote for days like today is be “fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” No mention of blood at all. Oh well. So how we might be able to think like Buffett in the crypto markets? The goal is to look around for the fallen angels of a month ago and see where there might be some bargains lying about. Today I want to highlight one of these “pearls” of the cryptoverse and talk about Oyster (PRL) token. It goes without saying that I am obviously not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice and don’t listen to me because I only looked up this coin initially because my daughter’s name is Pearl and then I read the whitepaper and I thought it was kinda neat and you should always invest your own money while considering your own unique circumstances etc. I have a very little amount of money in this investment so you shouldn’t listen to me anyway. This is not financial advice. Investments carry risk. At the very least, please just go and skim the whitepaper! Here: https://oyster.ws/OysterWhitepaper.pdf Okay. Done. Oyster (PRL), formerly Oyster Pearl, is an interesting project that melds together a rather elegant solution for two of the more interesting and achievable early crypto use cases. The first crypto use case involves decentralized storage. Other projects in this space that you might know are Sic (SC), Filecoin (FIL), and Storj (STORJ). With the exponential growth in data and also the growth of the companies that generate, manage, analyze, and interpret our data - the FAANG/BAT internet “barons” of the modern era - ways to decentralize and reduce the cost burden of data for megacap companies, not to mention just regular everyday Joes like me, are going to be the foundation of a few quite valuable companies. For comparison, Dropbox and Box are the centralized competitors in this space. Dropbox is currently estimated to be worth about $10 billion. Box trades on the stock market as BOX. It is currently valued at around $3 billion. The second crypto use case for PRL involves disrupting the entire media monetization industry. The debate goes back at least as far as media has been a thing. There is a constant battle between content creator and content distributor. In this traditional scenario, the centralizing force in the economy is the distributor. In the blues era, artists literally sold their rights for a song. They would get paid for the performance, but the capitalist behind the recording desk would own the rights to that song and the recording. Later, agents would come along to “save” the artists. But that’s just a less-powerful centralizing force (the agents) doing battle with a more powerful centralizing force (the labels). With the digitization of music, the industry became more decentralized. But we still have the Apple Music Store, so there is still quite a bit of power left in this system to the distributor at the expense of the creator. But that is all about to change. The rising costs of live sports media to wholesale entertainment distributors like Disney shows the potential for what happens wise up to the value of the content they create. They get paid. When the NBA renegotiated its media rights deals with Turner, ESPN, Tencent and others, value of the teams skyrocketed! The Houston Rockets, whose best player is set to start a $50 million a year contract, were not coincidentally just sold for more than $2.2 BILLION. Media is by its very nature traditionally a highly centralized industry. They make money by being the gateway through which you consume your media. But they don’t make any media. Not really. The content creators (the artists) themselves do. Previously, independent content creators were not powerful enough to confront entrench centralized media forces. But with technology like the Oyster Protocol, they have a fighting chance to have their, at first, tiny voice heard and get compensated fairly by those that hear it and appreciate it. Other projects on the more ambitious, and rather broad, side of this space are the Basic Attention Token (BAT), Kin (KIN), and our beloved STEEM. I’m sure there are others. More specific to the advertising media industry, where projects are essentially trying to “blockchain-ify” the existing agent business model, are AdEx (ADX) and Chinapex (CPX). A couple of blockchain projects that disrupt the media monetization industry are gonna be ridiculously valuable. And, hey! It maybe could end up being Oyster (PRL). So what got my attention from a chart perspective in the past day of “blood in the street” crypto pricing? Well, check out my highly advanced technical analysis below! From 7,516 to 14,078 satoshis in BTC is a really serious high-volume move in a way-way-down market. When the entire global market cap for cryptos starts to creep back up, this pearl of the cryptoverse could generate a little alpha for risk-tolerant crypto investors.

Hence, I present to you my updated global crypto markets support line! As I posted yesterday during the crash, it looks to me like $8200/BTC and the $390 B market cap line are critical levels of support. Although we dipped significantly below the $390 B line yesterday (CMC shows a low of $348 B at 8:47 UTC), we only spent at total of 3 hours trading below that critical $390 B line. On February 3, markets again tested the $390 B line and, so far, have held. At the time I’m writing this, the global market cap for cryptos stands at about $414 billion. So it looks like we are getting some breathing room. For myself, I’ll go back to managing my investments, planning my classes, and caring for my daughter… But I definitely am gonna set an alert for the next time the market cap gets around $390 B!

One of the most attractive reasons to buy into the shiny new asset class that are crypto-assets is their low overall correlation with the assets that we are already invested in. In other words, we like that bitcoin zigs, when the rest of the market zags. The most recent government shutdown provided a great example of this low correlation. At the stroke of midnight, like clockwork almost, when the government began to officially cease operations, the price of bitcoin started to inch up, eventually leading a 10% rally within a day after the shutdown. Granted, that rally then quickly evaporated, but the point is asset managers tend to gravitate towards assets that provide a counterweight to macro-economic sentiment.

Right here: https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@shanghaipreneur/undervalued-coin-watch-oyster-prl The Oyster Protocol “could be” the solution to everything that plagues the internet. Or it could just be another failed project. Whatever happens on that front, PRL is most certainly an undervalued coin in the cryptocurrency space. Take a look at this hourly blow-by-blow from February 8th through 11th: At its peak, that was something like a 90% move in a day. This action is what small cap coins are all about. Now when you combine a small cap coin and news, actual real bullish-as-fuck news, not just some fluff come up with by the PR firm you hired, you get price movement backed by SIGNIFICANT VOLUME. On my CMC screen, I’m looking at $6 million in trades executed in the past 24 hours. That’s A LOT for a small cap coin like PRL. So obviously the next question any “rational” investor should ask (and let’s face it - does ANYONE know ANYBODY that is in fact “rational”? I’m still looking…) is WHY? Why did this little useless ERC-20 token spike in price so much in just one day? And why is Shanghaipreneur wasting his Sunday morning coffee to tell Steemit about it? Fair points, for sure. I like coffee and mine is getting cold af from spending too much time writing this post. Here are the 2 reasons that I have been able to discern so far. 1) COIN BURN https://medium.com/oysterprotocol/oyster-pearl-team-update-4-f2cc22eca1a7 The coin burn is the new method for “little coins that could” to regenerate interest in people trading them. It is a logic based on the most basic of economic principles. When you decrease supply, assuming that demand stays constant, the price of an asset MUST correct upwards to reflect its new status as a more “rare” asset. But beware that caveat “if demand stays constant,” which is not always guaranteed. Lots of coins are doing this, or contemplating this, right now. Perhaps bot favorite Tron (TRX) is the most famous coin thinking about using this tactic. As a result, some crazy Youtubers are calling for TRX to go to $15. That’s nonsense. To me, coin burns are all just semantics. Having too many coins is a sign that there is less demand for your coin than you thought there would be. And highlighting that fact does not seem to me to be the most prudent thing to do for your coin’s value in the long run. But hey, coin burns are working, and we are in a market where anything is on the table. Whatever works… right? But this coin burn announcement was on February 2 and the “moon” didn’t happen until February 10, eight days later. But the crypto markets were in a freeze and it’s understandable that “risk-on” trades like undervalued small caps might get swept under the rug until the next market upturn. So I’m willing to give this factor a 20% weight as to the reason for Oyster’s huge move yesterday. But the primary factor for yesterday’s “moon” is… 2) AIRDROP!!!! https://medium.com/oysterprotocol/dawn-of-a-new-era-3ca2e2f5a1c6 Airdrops are another new favorite strategy for coins in 2018. This post by the anonymous leader of Oyster, Bruno Block, had the most to do with yesterday’s huge move upwards. Titled “Dawn of a New Era,” it’s short and to the point. He concisely and precisely points the reader to where he is trying to pilot this project: “Oyster is a revolutionary protocol that resets the assumptions of the current internet paradigm and addresses the aforementioned issues [the internet being constantly threatened by governing bodies worldwide concerning censorship, regulation, and spying a part of which has resulted in the net neutrality fiasco in the US] with a new comprehensive platform.” That’s a mouthful. And whether or not Block can pull it off is yet to be seen. But at least now we know why he/she has kept himself anonymous up to this point in the development of the project. Previously, the naysayers have used the project leader’s anonymity to deride the project. But read that quote above and start counting how many mega-cap companies, and of course the politicians that they lobby, that will be disrupted with this technology. Just off the top of my head… Verizon, AT&amp;T, Comcast, Netflix, Google, Facebook… That’s trillions of dollars at stake here with this potential technology. So hopefully you understand Block’s caution a little better. Plus, Satoshi’s anonymity hasn’t stopped Bitcoin from being worth a hundred billion dollars so I struggle to understand the critique. We are talking about one of the most fascinating, and achievable, use cases for cryptocurrencies - the equitable and sustainable monetization of media. Now, how is Block going to achieve this disruption? Well, with yet another coin, of course. Oyster (PRL) will soon airdrop to all PRL holders (or HODLers as is the current industry jargon) a new coin appropriately called Shell (SHL). The reason for this split is not entirely clear to me, but it has something to do with fairly compensating content creators (the ones that actually make the media) and media distribution arms (the ones that pay for the infrastructure to deliver the media). Here’s what Block has to say about Shells: “Today I am introducing Oyster Shell (SHL). Shells are used to pay for connectivity and Dapp operation across the Oyster meshnet, whilst Pearls are used for static data retention on the tangle. Shell is not pegged to storage like how Pearl is. In the future you will be able to use Shells to access the decentralized web, connectivity that entirely bypasses ISPs and centralized infrastructure.” Seriously, that’s revolutionary! At a current market cap of just about $70 million (as of writing), Oyster (PRL) is still on my Undervalued Coin Watch List. On the list of altcoins liable to make the leap to $1 billion market cap, Bruno Block and his team are pretty far up there. If that happened, we’d be talking about a 14x move from here. Block has said as much in his previous Medium posts. Work through the calculations in this post,https://medium.com/oysterprotocol/how-prl-pricing-will-work-in-the-future-d67c4f231386 And you will find that Block thinks the PRL coin should eventually be worth $15, which is about 14x from here. Great minds think alike? Anyways, please note this is not financial advice and I’m totally biased because I own some of this coin and my daughter’s name is Pearl. So I mean, DYOR but feel free to follow me or ask any questions below. I’m sure I’ll be talking about Oyster Protocol soon enough.

Way more excited than I was the last time this happened. Why? Because last time BTC reaching ten thousand dollars seemed inevitable. After the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) FUD body-slammed BTC back into the $5,500-$6,500 range somewhere around November 15, it literally went straight up. Every day. Sometimes a couple thousand dollars in a day. That can’t last. It’s simply not sustainable. But to see it crash land and bounce like a red kickball off those exact same levels (a.k.a. around $6,000) during the sustained crash from mid-January to early February… That shows some moxy! At the time of writing, we are at around a $475 billion market cap for global crypto, which is about 70% off the lows we saw less than 2 weeks ago. For typically long-term investors like myself, I’m just not used to seeing this kind of action. But also, as a long-term investor, I know that the intermediate stops along the way are just for scenery and don’t matter all that much. This is a bubble in the making for sure, but we have in no way seen the top. And I think this superb resiliency has proven it. For all the doubters out there, and hey I know, a $500 billion drop in market cap is a scary thing to watch. Sure, I was a little disappointed to see my portfolio go from 6x to 2x, too… Who wouldn’t? But I was never really worried. Why? I have a couple of reasons. #1) Fibonacci - I knew one of the support levels would hold. It turned out to be $280 billion, which just so happens to be a nearly perfect 61.8% Fibonacci retracement. Fibonnaci’s my dude now. Maybe I’ll wrote more about him in a later post. #2) Chinese New Year - I am married to China. I love the place. But darn it if you can’t get anything done in the two weeks leading up to the lunar new year, which occurs sometime in January or February every year. It’s happening right now. People are home and bored af in their hometown. So we’re seeing volume pick up. But you don’t have to take my anecdotal evidence. Why would you? Take a look at this post from @budz82 It’s great. When you click on over, you’ll see that EVERY SINGLE YEAR FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS, the market has taken a dive starting about three-and-a-half weeks before the Chinese New Year. I had confidence that this year would be no different. #3) Portfolio Diversification - I don’t have all my money in crypto. I manage a balanced portfolio of uncorrelated assets. That means that when one thing zigs, the others zag. And vice versa. In the long run, this is a proven strategy to build wealth and sleep easy at night. I talk about this over at my blog LowBetaPortfolio.com. It’s not easy and it takes some time to master your emotions for sure. But anyone who invests for long-term goals (housing, education, retirement, health care) has got to think this way. We are now less than $100 away. The excitement is real. People are incessantly shooting off fireworks outside. They must be excited about BTC10K, too! Oh wait, those are just my wife’s neighbors going a little bit nuts for Chinese New Year.

So far it’s been an amazing experience. But one element I keep coming back to that I think all fathers must struggle with at some point or another is, HOW THE FUCK AM I GONNA PAY FOR THIS CHILD? It forces you to make some tough decisions. Like chasing the startup dream for innumerable years… Once you have a beautiful daughter staring back at with you big brown eyes and her future life is literally hanging on every action you make, it starts to make you think critically about your existence. Suddenly, working for free no longer sounds so romantic. I know, I know, WE ARE GOING TO THE MOON! That’s what they say in cryptoland. For non-blockchain enthusiasts, the entrepreneurs I know have their eyes set on merely a seaside bungaloo somewhere in Southeast Asia. It’s kinda like, “Hey y’all, get get get it! But I gotta hang back here and work overtime (for money!) to pay for the nanny and save up for her ever-ballooning education costs. And that never hits home harder than when your baby turns into a living, breathing, walking, shitting, babbling nonsense toddler-creature that at times seems like it has come straight from the depths of hell and at other times seems like the world’s most perfect calm angel. For me, it was almost like, “Whoa, where did this girl come from? That was fast.” Yeah, before you become a parent, you hear people say all the time - THEY GROW UP FAST - and sure, you’re like, of course they do! They’re humans. But you don’t really know what that means till it actually happens to you. As a finance professor, of course my little spreadsheet-and-charts oriented mind turns to what comes easiest to me - the calculation of the need for money. I’m hoping mom and grandma can sort out my little monster or at least tell me what I need to do in that regard. But I’m already thinking about how I can instill in my little girl all the financial traits that I would like her to utilize for the rest of her life. There are four main areas of personal finance that kids need to learn about. The means for teaching kids these four aspects depends on the type of children you have. But let’s keep it simple for now. As parents, we need to teach them how to earn, save, budget, and invest. 1. Earning I strongly believe in kids working part-time jobs when they are young. At first, parents may have to seek these opportunities out for them, but eventually, children will figure out the most suitable activities for themselves. Selling lemonade. Flyering. Lawnmowing. Babysitting. Tutoring. Online entrepreneurialism. Who knows what the future will be like? But I hope to have my girl thinking about her piggy bank from just about the time she starts asking me for money. 2. Saving For saving, I plan to incentivize her by matching her savings 401-k style. Something like, “I will give you 50% more of what you save, but the money that goes in that account does not come out unless we as a family agree that the purchase is worth your savings.” That means that that money is not going to be spent on the latest fad or toy. Or ice cream and sandwiches with her friends. I’ma make her write an essay justifying her purchase every time she wants to pull money out of that account. 3. Budgeting I really like the idea my mom has about this, even though of course I hated it growing up. Do not bail out your kids! Not for sales taxes. Not for lunch money. Not for bouts of pitifulness. If they don’t have enough money, then they can’t buy it. If they spent the money on something else, then they can’t buy the thing they think they want. Let them learn about the tradeoffs that are associated with purchases of consumer goods. No one needs everything. 4. Investing I have already opened a Coverdell Education Savings Account (this applies to Americans only), which is basically like a tax-free investing account that can only be spent on education expenses. Every year, I pick one stock and I put the maximum contribution of $2000 towards it. When my girl gets older, I hope that she will get actively involved with that selection. That’ll be her stock! When I was a kid, I was lucky enough to have a dad who let me pick two stocks for myself all by my lonesome. I picked 100 shares of Marvel Comics and 100 shares of Topps Baseball Cards. One did spectacularly well, the other… not so much. By the time Marvel had split three times and gone up a couple hundred percent, I was addicted to checking the ticker page in the business section of the newspaper everyday. At that point, I became an investor. And I have never looked back! Lastly, when they are old enough (maybe 10, maybe 12, it really depends on their interests) I will establish a Uniform Gift to Minors Account (UGMA). I will stick the money into something safe, like an index fund, balanced mutual fund, or municipal bond fund, something that pays a healthy and regular dividend. I’ll show them the statements every month and say, “You see, we didn’t do anything at all and look at how our money is increasing every single month. This is called compounding!” Like Albert Einstein once said, COMPOUND INTEREST IS THE GREATEST INVENTION THE WORLD EVER PRODUCED. It’s never too early to teach your children that lesson.

NEVER. Why You Should Never Buy a Luxury Car.","text":"Simply put, buying a car for $200,000 or more is a big waste of money. Might as well do this: To me, in order to buy a Lamborghini, or any other type of high-performance luxury vehicle, your salary would have to be SO BIG that spending $200,000 should feel like most of us taking our spouses out to a high-class dinner at a Michelin restaurant. Feel free to call me crazy, but that would be my criteria for deciding how big a salary I would need in order to justify buying such a car. So what do I mean by that? Let’s see… I can calculate the relative cost of purchasing such a car and then compare that to a minimally middle-class income. So bear with me while I write on the back of the envelope here… A really nice dinner can set you back about $300… which is about 10% of the monthly disposable income of the lowest tier of middle-class folks… To determine what your annual salary would need to be… IMHO… to buy such a car… You would simply multiply $200,0001012… for a total of… $24 million per year. Yeah, I know it sounds crazy… At least we’re talking pre-tax income here. That’s gross income before taxes. But this is just my opinion. Let me explain. The fact is that you really only just need to go from one place to another. And today, there are just so many affordable, safe, clean, and more environmentally friendly options to get people from A to B and back again. There’s public transportation, Didi/Uber, Mobike/ofo, walking, taking your own bike, those crazy motorized personal transport things, etc. In some cities even, you really don’t even need to have a car. They’re more trouble than their worth. IN SOME CITIES, even, the economic costs of owning a car, in the long run, FARRRR outstrip the costs associated with simply purchasing that car. Let me list the economic costs associated with car ownership right here: A parking space to store your car while you’re at home. Parking fees to park your car while you’re out and about town. Insurance. Fuel. License plate fees, which in cities like Shanghai can far exceed $10,000! Maintenance costs. Don’t forget to include the value of all the personal time you have to spend managing this declining-value asset! If I left any reason out please let me know in the comments below.  To me, when you add up all of these costs, they are such an onerous burden that it just doesn’t make any economic sense to own any car, much less a luxury vehicle like a Lamborghini. Especially in big cities with well-developed public transportation and plenty of amenities nearby, all of these expenses combined outweigh the usefulness of the asset. So maximizing the economic utility of car ownership happens with a car that costs somewhere between $10,000 and $30,000. Anything beyond that is really just a waste of money. Instead, I prefer to buy stocks, companies, houses, and crypto for my investment portfolio. These are all assets that actually have a chance of going up in value. Disagree? Let me know!

The controversial nature of the government body responsible for this name change has, naturally, led to the current confusion over the country’s name. Many people still refer to a certain Southeast Asian country with a population of just over 50 million and sandwiched between India on the west and Thailand on the east as Burma. Why? As an American, I never really heard anyone refer to the country as anything other than Burma until President Obama gave a speech at the University of Yangon in November 2012. At the time, I was even sure that the television reporter had made a mistake! Surely he had meant to say Rangoon, which is indeed the same city, but in my fairy tale Rudyard Kipling childhood I had only known it by its colonial name. For Burmese people, the words have long had political connotations. Those that firmly opposed the military junta used the word Burma. Those that staunchly supported it used the word Myanmar. Those that did not care, well, they still do not care which word you use. As a result, older people, at least those that are not connected to the government, prefer Burma to Myanmar, while younger people tend to use Myanmar, especially when speaking English. Neither the United States nor the National League for Democracy (NLD), the party chaired by 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner and now the equivalent of the prime minister of Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi, officially recognizes the name Myanmar. And yet Obama did, and he did it during a landmark speech during an historic visit. Before Obama, Burma was the preferred term for people who did not support the old government. But this perception is rapidly changing. For now, only the most confrontational supporters of the former government, whose preference it is to use the word Myanmar, would care which word a foreigner uses. Meeting such a person is an extremely rare event. Additionally, the extreme supporters of fringe ethnic groups, such as the Karen National Union (KNU) or Kachin Independence Army (KIA) that fight for autonomy and independence outside of the urban centers and whose preference it is to use the word Burma, may also be sensitive to the usage of a particular name. It should be noted that if your intention is purely to do business in the country, you are unlikely to encounter these types of people. The vast majority of people do not seem to have a preference for the name you choose to use. However, it is useful to know that young Burmese will use the word Myanmar in reference to the country, its people, its main language, and its nationality. The usage might sound a bit awkward in English: I am from Myanmar. I speak Myanmar. I am Myanmar.

Recently, on just such a day, I had occasion to be on the newly developed/developing waterfront of the Lower Bund. I had just left a breakfast meeting and, turning to the left, saw this: The Pudong skyline looking out over the Lujiazui district back across the Huangpu river towards the old Shanghai laocheng literally encompasses the word “high finance.” The painstakingly wrought, over the last 26 years, symbol of the rise of “new China” is an interesting contrast to what one sees when one merely turns one’s head to the right and walks a bit down the nearby street. Just across the main thoroughfare dividing the waterfront retail district from a seemingly-forever-under-construction new residential district, we have a thriving local market built into the first floor of a tenement building built in the early days of Deng Xiaoping’s kaifang or “open reform” era, most likely during the late 80s or early 90s. The entrepreneurial spirit of the 100+ local workers buzzing about the place even in the late morning hours is palpable. One can imagine how thriving this place must be in the prime shopping hours of 7 am to 9 am. Yet, these are the kind of intensely local and vibrant scenes that are being replaced by the steel-faced mountains of commerce that are amassing quickly on a curious finger of the Huangpu River delta that once was merely a sleepy port for fishermen and excess tonnage that couldn’t be offloaded on the much busier ports located on the Bund. Before the recent revamp of the Lower Bund, most of the surrounding area looked like this: Blocks and blocks of low-slung buildings, crowded up against the streets to maximize commercial square footage, yet with interior sections somehow providing enough room tucked away amongst byzantine alleyways, creating an open space warm and welcoming enough to forge a community of friendly smiles and vigilant neighbors. That part of Shanghai is slowly receding. It has to. Shanghai and its surrounding eponymous province command an economy that is larger than most countries! At $473 billion in 2017, the Shanghai economy would rank 26th in the world if it were a country, between Belgium and Thailand. On top of that, its economy is growing at 6.9%, much much faster than its current rivals on the GDP League Table. Thus, these interesting, informative, and transformative contrasts shall persist for the expected Shanghai future. After all, it is the nature of “contradiction” that has always propelled this country forward. Until these “contradictions” eventually resolve themselves, as they always eventually do, we should enjoy these brief moments of clarity in time when we can observe two so potent and dominant visions of society exist simultaneously side-by-side. At least, that is, until one of those visions eventually shuffles off stage left, as all political economies eventually do. The essential spirit of Shanghai will still remain. Whether its in FinTech or e-commerce, IoT devices or mobile gaming, fish hawking or vegetable selling, the pattern is still the same. Shanghairen work hard and they’re pretty darn efficient in going about it. And they certainly get up everyday way before this laowai has even finished his breakfast!

Bitcoin could become a tasteless, odorless, borderless, soulless store of value that is accepted around the world. And in some ways already is. They might then or otherwise go into a lengthy description of the role of miners in the process that both secures the bitcoin blockchain and mints new bitcoins. Some kind of verbal equivalent to the following diagram: These are answers that technologists provide. But I disagree. The value of bitcoin does not primarily lie in the billions of dollars of hardware and electricity spent on its pursuit. Don’t get me wrong. I believe that a significant portion of the intrinsic value of cryptoassets is derived from the investment of capital and, most importantly, “work” in the manner connoted by bitcoin’s proof-of-work protocol. But the value of that “work,” as defined, does not exceed the value of the social community that is de facto created around bitcoin. When you invest in the brand new asset class that is coalescing around bitcoin and cryptoassets, you are not really investing specifically in the cold, hard technology as much as you are investing in the community of creators and visionaries (and users!) that are behind that technology. They are what forms the core of the support infrastructure for the technology to flourish and develop on its own. Because at billion-dollar valuations for blockchains, you really aren’t paying for what the technology is capable of today, investors are paying for what the technology could be, in the far, far future. Although it could end up being quite a lot in terms of valuation, the investors of tomorrow won’t be paying up for today’s version of the software. Customers who didn’t give you the time of day for your first-generation product have to be lining up for a glimpse of your hot new product by the third or fourth generation comes around. So it’s the iteration after the iteration (and most of the time, it’s some iteration after that!) that is what’s going to drive value in the not-too-distant future. The success or failure of each of those iterations is determined by the people who develop the software. In short, that’s the value of any bitcoin-blockchain-cryptoasset enterprise. It’s the community. People that gather together to inspire, to celebrate, to prod, to cajole, to support one another as they strive toward a future that they believe could change the world. And who’s to say they’re not right? Bitcoin, for example, comes with a fantastic community that loves, supports, and nurtures it. For some reason, they even passionately argue about whether its data blocks should be 1 MB or 8 MB, to the point that they even call each other names and get into virtual fistfights about it. That’s true passion! Dogecoin is the perfect example. Named after a popular Japanese meme and cute puppy in general, basically a joke, but a community grew up around the project and now it sports a $500 million valuation. If the value of a community of cute dog lovers and crypto enthusiasts is $500 million, then what’s next? Right? To some, that might sound crazy. But when you think about what companies are valuable today - the FAANG and BATs of the world - the Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix Google Baidu Alibaba Tencent nexus of the greater globalized digital economy - they are the companies that build, maintain, nurture, and grow user networks like Instagram, Apple Store, Amazon Prime, Tabao, Alipay, WeChat etc. Those user networks are so profitable because they are subject to network effects, which means that companies can grow at exponential rates for extended periods of time as long as they are expanding their network. What drives those networks? These networks that are literally worth billions and billions of dollars? Why are new globally connected user media platforms worth so much money? Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn and all the others clearly derive their value from their users. Those users are people, not just data, and those people make up a community. Those communities right now have no stake in the FAANG/BAT networks that they are actively creating, maintaining, and growing. That’s wrong. One of the great goals in crypto is to more equitably redistribute the power of a network. Where gatekeepers once extracted a heavy toll from media-platform users, either in data or attention or both, without including them in any profit redistribution, they will soon no longer be able to retain those margins. Those business models are about to get majorly disrupted. That’s the power of the community that cryptocurrencies build. They are more than just a “Friday night beers” club for locals or some literary book-of-the-month club. These users literally bring the “network” in network effects to the decentralized networks that they frequent on a regular basis. They are literally what their cryptocurrencies derive their value from. It has a certain tautological elegance. Bringing people around a common cause increases the value of the token that represents that cause. This concept of value might be difficult to grasp at first. Difficult at least until you begin to think about what the value of any sovereign currency today is based on. Long gone are the days when a king hoarded a stash of gold in a dusty basement stocked with dragon skeletons and mead. Today’s modern fiat currencies derive the majority of their value from the exact same place that bitcoin does. From the throngs and throngs of people who believe that those currencies can enable them to buy the necessities of life. But the difference is that the bitcoin and crypto communities stand stronger together. On the grand human scale, they are a small but vocal few. Fiat enthusiasts are a fractured and disloyal tangled mass grasping for a grubstake in a game they can’t win. At least with bitcoin we know approximately how many units that are going to be in circulation at the end of next month! Let me describe the power of the bitcoin community via one amazing example. Money 20/20 recently held a payments race where they pitted 5 racers, each with one form of payment method only, to a race across the United States. Against seemingly all odds, do you know who won? Bitcoin. Because of a community that has organically sprung up around a revolutionary technology and its “imaginary” currency created by an anonymous man who may or may not be Japanese or even one person. That’s power. The value of any bitcoin-blockchain-cryptoasset enterprise is its community. And THAT is the true value of Bitcoin - the people who love it, the people who fight for it, the people that put their lives and their future on the line to educate, familiarize and proselytize the Bitcoin gospel. In that sense, Bitcoin is very similar to the fiat money it may one day replace. It is said that the value of a currency can be measured by the number of people who have “faith” that it has certain value. The fiat in fiat money is derived from that same very “faith.” Though that faith be supported by guns, butter, or mere “exorbitant privilege” as the French used to say, one can say that the US Dollar is currently very successful. Its current “market cap,” to use the term in the way that the crypto markets employ, is an astounding $13.8 trillion. And it’s literally growing everyday. Though the Bitcoin market cap hovers around $200 billion, a mere 1.4% of today’s money stock at the Federal Reserve, I can’t help but notice that the Bitcoin community is awash with a lot more than just “faith.” It has fervor. So when people ask me, “What determines the value of bitcoin?” I can only respond with one answer and that answer… That answer is you, dear reader. You must be like the woodcutter in this famous Francis HODLer painting. It is you - the curious, the ostentatious, the visionary firebrand, the sampler, the educator… You must pick up the axe each day and continue to go to work, and to work with a purpose. You are going to be what makes (some of) these cryptoassets so valuable in the future. The bitcoin and crypto-in-general community attracts some of the best people in the world. And some of the worst. But most of what I see is a positive, vibrant community that is poised to create the next Silicon Valley… decentralized.

Getting meta seems to be what it’s all about in the self-help/side-gig guru economy. Can’t make money off your own content website? Make a website about making content websites and sell access to that. Can’t sell products online? Make a website about selling products online and then sell those products about selling products as products themselves. So I’m going meta. Watch this be the most upvoted post I’ve ever had. What drove me to write this post? Well, I think for many people who are just getting started with Steemit, even just getting used to the functions of the STEEM cryptocurrency and how to manipulate that to your own benefit can be difficult to comprehend. Much less is discussed about getting your head up above water, so to speak, on the platform. A lot of great content falls through the cracks because it never gets the first flurry of upvotes that will get it swept up in to the “Trending” or “Hot” sections of the website. Why do we risk letting great content fall through the cracks? Well, the number one reason is that the author has refused to invest in any STEEM in order to show that they have “skin in the game”. And, yeah I know, not everyone has the investment capital to “prime the pump” when it comes to their steemwallets. That’s understandable. We don’t want to restrict access to Steemit at all whatsoever. But I’m just highlighting that fact as the primary reason new authors do not gain traction on the platform. Once you’ve gotten a bit of spare SBD from posting and curating for a while (or buy loading up your account from an exchange)… you’ll need to start “mining” some upvotes from many of the great steembots that are available. Here are a list of three great resources to start your journey off right with steembots: SmartSteem.com ‍ Here is a very simple and easy place where you can go to buy guaranteed profitable upvotes for your content. Just hit the “Buy Votes Now” and throw your in your individual information and post link, jam in your key and you’re good to go. A gaggle of votes, usually with little to no weight, will flock to your post over the next few minutes. Bonus: This bot does not spam your post with a comment letting everyone know you’ve upvoted yourself with a bot. But they might get a little suspicious when you have 56 upvotes and only 20 views. Just sayin’… Anyways, minnows got to do whatever they can to survive on Steemit, so whatevs… which brings me to my 2nd resource: Minnowbooster.net  Minnowbooster is a marketplace that makes it easy for you to lease your STEEM Power out to other people or, if you’re thinking about gearing up for a content blitz, you may want to think about leasing STEEM Power for yourself for a time. But before you start getting into the vast potential profits of delegating STEEM Power, the first thing you might want to do is sell your vote to minnowbooster in order to earn SBD on your curation. Basically, if you aren’t voting on something every day, you are wasting some of your ability as a STEEMholder to earn block rewards from curating content. If you’re not gonna use your STEEM Power, why not let minnowbooster use it on your behalf and cut you in on the profits? SteemBotTracker.com 烙 This is an amazing website. I can’t even believe it’s free. Here, among other steembot madness, @yabapmatt maintains a list of all the active upvote bots and when they will be voting their vote. Essentially, the perfect cycle for upvoting is 2 hours, 24 minutes. It takes that long to fully charge your vote to the 100% level. So upvote bots hold auctions for their votes (which, on some bots, are augmented by massive amounts of STEEM Power) and then divvy up that vote to the bidders according to their bids every 2 hours, 24 minutes. Once you have a bit of a stack of SBD, these bots can really be profitable. But beware - You can also lose STEEM bidding on upvote bots if too many people bid on the same bot in the same period. So keep your eyes peeled on SteemBotTracker.com and put in your bids at the last minute eBay-style. There you have it. I’ve gone meta. Making a STEEM post about STEEM.

That is the question.","text":"There is a seismic shift coming to how blockchains achieve consensus. When Bitcoin was an experiment distributed on a few thousand battered old machines back in the shadow of the Great Recession, it made sense to incentivize people to contribute hashing power to the blockchain by allowing them to “mine” cryptocurrency in exchange for their hardware processing cycles. This process of reaching consensus on the blockchain is known as a Proof of Work (PoW) protocol. But that was back when the processing power needed to maintain the Bitcoin blockchain was miniscule. Now the processing power being contributed to the Bitcoin blockchain, according to BTC.com is beyond 25 Exa hash. What’s an Exa hash? Beats me. In trying to figure out the answer myself, I came across this number And this much handier description by Standard Crypto of what one exahash looks like: Today I am going to visualize an exahash. I’ll focus on the more more efficient 2.1 MW number for the new gear, as a small concession to sanity. In this scenario our office building has 28nm asics and is cranking out 10 PH. We need one hundred of our ten petahash office buildings. But these are no usual office buildings. [These are ones with huge] diesel backup generators. The Hoover Dam produces 2000 MW, so we could power 100 of our mega-mines if we had exclusive use of the power produced there. Or 10 747 jets at peak power. Or 10 nimitz class aircraft carriers at peak power. You could power all of Las Vegas with 7000 MW, or 3.5 Hoover Dams. So, our exahash looks like about one third of the Las Vegas skyline. Now we have 25 Exa hash, or the equivalent of 7 glamour gambling cities like Las Vegas in all of its electricity-consumption glory, constantly crunching away on the Bitcoin #blockchain. In today’s everexpanding hashrate and increasing difficulty environment, that number is set to expand exponentially. The last time anyone cared about what an exahash is was way back in July 2017, a scant eight months ago in the real world but a lifetime in crypto. Back on Independence Day weekend, a flurry of articles came out celebrating bitcoin surpassing the 6 Exahash mark. That’s a more than 4-fold increase in a little over 8 months! Needless to say, powering seven Las Vegas’s puts a heavy load on the global power generation and electricity distribution infrastructure. And let’s not forget that in most of the world we aren’t talking about offshore wind farms and vast solar panel arrays, we’re talking about this: Now utilities are fighting back. Plattsburgh, a town in upstate New York, just banned all future crypto-mining operations due to one - Coinmint LLC - using up 10% of the town’s available cheap power. As #BTC increases in price, more people mine it, which leads to a difficulty adjustment in the mining software, which leads to an arms race of GPUs, ASICs and other techno-acronyms that then require ever more #energy. It’s a devastating feedback loop. Every time the Bitcoin mining software ratchets up the difficulty, it inexorably centralizes the network, which essentially puts us right back in the privileged class system that the revolutionary aims of bitcoin were railing against. Take a look at this chart from BTC.com: That purple swath in the middle is the fate of small Bitcoin miners. One year ago today, they contributed approximately one-third of the processing power to the Bitcoin blockchain. Today, in just twelve short months, that number has already dwindled to 11.06%. The other 89% of Bitcoin’s hashing power comes from the 10 mines, mostly Chinese, listed in the graphic. That’s clearly not a decentralized system anymore and it’s getting more centralized every month. Therefore, the proof of work protocol for reaching blockchain consensus has proven difficult to scale efficiently, negative in terms of having an upward impact on the Gini coefficient of the overall Bitcoin network, and perhaps most importantly to the non-technologist non-economist layman… IT IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN. But this incredibly valid criticism of #cryptocurrency only applies to proof of work (PoW) coins like #Bitcoin, #Litecoin, #Ethereum, #Monero, &amp; #Dash. Although #PoW coins will surely continue for the foreseeable future, their decline is inevitable. In fact, only 10 of the top 30 coins today are mineable coins. The alternative to PoW is Proof of Stake (PoS). PoW coins will certainly continue for the foreseeable future, but their decline is inevitable. In fact, only ten of the top 30 coins today are mineable coins. So how do PoS coins incentivize people to contribute resources to the blockchain? In the proof of work protocol, it is easy to see that the carrot is newly minted coins that come with each confirmed and verified block of transactions. But the incentive structures vary widely with PoS coins. With some, like NEO, you simply “stake” your assets into an online wallet or software wallet program. Some, like New Economy Movement (NEM), require you to open a software wallet and always leave a computer on. Still others, like ZenCash (ZEN), require the operation of a virtual private server (VPS). Additionally, PoS cryptoassets often require a sizable amount of the coin in order to enjoy comprehensive staking benefits. For instance, VeChain has a main token (VET) that generates 0.00042 Thor Power (VTHO) per day. However, tokenholders of 10,000 VET or more qualify to operate an Xnode, which qualifies for substantially higher staking rewards. Even larger hodlers of VET are entitled to even higher yielding rewards. In contrast to PoW, where raw processing power is required to verify all those transactions and decrypt all those cryptographic puzzles, the various ways of “staking” your PoS coins on the blockchain prove that you have committed financial resources to the blockchain. With these “staked” #PoS coins, tokenholders regularly earn dividends. It makes them happy. And more willing to invest for the long term. Proof of Stake does not require 25 Exa Hash per second of global processing power and thank goodness for that. The trees, and the governments who care about them, can breathe a sigh of relief. The inevitable growth of cryptoassets will not bring about an environmental apocalypse. The next generation of blockchains, the so-called third-generation blockchains, are almost all based on PoS. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin even introduced a paper in January 2018 titled “Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget” that outlined the future form of a hybrid PoW/PoS Ethereum blockchain. So it looks like the future of #crypto will be good for your wallet. And the birds and the trees, too. This page is synchronized from the post: To Mine Or To Stake?

After all, more than a few of us still drop to our knees today screaming, “How could you?” before getting up, dusting ourselves off, and moving on with our day. But he did something about it. He published Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System in October 2008 and he released the first bitcoin software in January 2009.

But that didn’t stop bitcoin from making its own moon today on Thursday, April 12, 2018. Nearly $100 million of volume occurred at around 6:30 p.m. Beijing time. How do I know this? Well, please just check out my very excellent technical analysis (TA) from my very own Blockfolio: See! TA is easy, @haejin! Market order books all over the world went way way out of whack. I know because I had a big order in for ZEN at 0.06 ETH even… that’s my new job - I’m a ZEN shill. Ever since they started talking about their new supernodes, and then they went and published this awesome whitepaper about it, which is like 7 pages of pure crypto-revolution! But I digress… I checked the order book after my class was over and noticed that my order at 0.06 ETH had finally filled, but but I also found out that some orders had been filled as low as 0.0426!!!Obviously, that meant either ZEN crashed or ETH mooned… It was the latter. As always, people try to explain why such a drastic unexpected move happens. We of course had the Mt. Goxers out with the claim that this transaction was a move by legal counsel to sell their lode on Bittrex. Although how that portends a bullish move I don’t know. (Seems bearish to me, but I guess we’ll see in the next few days.) We also have an interesting theory put forth by this article that publicizes a recent paper by Mufti Muhammad Abu Bakar, Sharia advisor and compliance officer at Blossom Finance, that claims that cryptocurrency is one of the few Western finance constructs that is compatible with the Sharia prohibition against fractional reserve banking. I bet you can find another hundred theories as to why bitcoin, all of a sudden, after a long few days of rangebound trading, suddenly JUMPED out to a thousand-dollar increase in less than 30 minutes. I know it’s crazy. It’s totally like OMG WTF! (Coincidentally, OmiseGo was also up 23% - more than Bitcoin’s leap - as of this writing. The What The Fuck Coin is, to my knowledge, still not available. WTF fuh realz!) But I think everyone ignores the most likely proposition. It just happened for no reason at all. The legendary mentor of Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham, is famous for saying, “In the short run the market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine.” The crypto markets today were a day for the weighing machines.

But, in the plainspoken way that only he can get away with, he unequivocally states that, for less talented investors than himself, EMH is most likely the best theory available to guide one’s investing. It’s crazy that Buffett is the one making these kinds of statements. After all, it is precisely his consistent investment success that provides the best example of why efficient market theory is preposterous. But there it is in black-and-white. I even found it on an inspirational quote meme so you know it must be a direct quote from the Oracle of Omaha himself. Buffet’s views on the supposed efficiency of the market are summed up by an oft-repeated parable of his. Mr. Market is an allegory used in Benjamin Graham’s renowned security analysis course at Columbia University. Buffett earned a master of economics there in 1951. If you want to read more about the story of Mr. Market check out my blog post on the subject, “Who is Mr. Market?”, but the basic idea is that Mr. Market represents the senseless everyman investor that we all wish we weren’t but know, in our heart of hearts, that we probably are. He offers practical advice about the vagaries of Mr. Market in the 1987 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Letter to Shareholders: But, like Cinderella at the ball, you must heed one warning or everything will turn into pumpkins and mice: Mr. Market is there to serve you, not to guide you. It is his pocketbook, not his wisdom, that you will find useful. If he shows up some day in a particularly foolish mood, you are free to either ignore him or to take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you fall under his influence. Indeed, if you aren’t certain that you understand and can value your business far better than Mr. Market, you don’t belong in the game. As they say in poker, “If you’ve been in the game 30 minutes and you don’t know who the patsy is, you’re the patsy.” Buffett bases this folksy perspective on his one true and unique skill - his verifiable talent in the field of capital allocation. He even goes so far as to say that he won the “ovarian lottery” by being placed in a political and legal system that for some reason rewards his one particular, and some might even say peculiar, talent in an exponential way. (By the way, the above image is obviously copyright Disney, FYI.) Robert P. Miles describes Buffett’s famous humblebrag in his book, Warren Buffett Wealth: Principles and Practical Methods Used by the World’s Greatest Investor (available on Google Play): He was gifted with unique skills to value companies, coupled with being born during the time period that would enjoy the greatest economic expansion and would be capitalism’s finest hour to date. One simply cannot underestimate the luck of being born in the United States, home of 4 percent of the world’s population but one half of the world’s capital and publicly traded companies, with a political and legal system that disproportionately rewards capital allocation talent over most other occupations, and during a century that experienced a sevenfold increase in the standard of living. (24) Buffett understands that he is incredibly lucky to have these talents. And to have them at this particular point in the trajectory of capitalist history. But he also understands that not everyone is preternaturally suited to his unique occupation, nor would they enjoy it as much as he does. In those cases in which people do not share his predisposition to master capital allocation strategy, Buffett believes that EMH serves the majority of “regular” investors in the best way possible. Note the advice he would give to the investment trustee of his own children that he offers in the 2013 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report: My advice to the trustee could not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard’s.) I believe the trust’s long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors – whether pension funds, institutions or individuals – who employ high-fee managers. These principles set a high bar for aspiring fund managers. But it is their collective struggle to exceed some benchmark that unleashes the power of efficient market theory in the first place. Buffett’s investing philosophy exposes this dialectic for the interminable struggle that it is and forever will be. Can YOU consistently beat the market? Probably not. But the fact that YOU and everyone else thinks they can is what makes the market efficient in the first place. This conundrum informs how Buffett stands astride this issue. Any investor in any given year can do better than the market. But those that do so consistently have a plan, a strategy, a system for continuous improvement that is continually improved upon itself that distinguishes their investments. Does that sound like you? If not, it’s off to the S&amp;P with you. And that’s fine. Hopefully, understanding Buffet’s nuanced position will help us all to Generate alpha year after year.

Why is Milton Friedman important? We’ll get to that in a minute. First, let’s take a look at the old guy. Not exactly a software visionary, right? In this picture in particular he looks like he is trying to explain how a pencil works, like it was some kind of newfangled tech. I mean this guy was way old even back in 1999, when he said the following in an interview that has, for some reason, struck me as a very important quote today: “One thing that’s missing but that will soon be developed is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the internet you can transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A, the way I can take a $20 bill hand it over to you and then there’s no record of where it came from.”#### I mean that’s a remarkably prescient statement for a super old guy who hadn’t even seen a smartphone or YouTube yet. (He died in 2006 at the age of 94.) I remember 1999… Not many of us around back then even knew what Google was! And here is the architect of the extant modern financial system warning, dare I say advocating even, something he called e-cash## In order to truly understand the importance of Friedman making a statement like this, one has to understand the rather substantial role he played in shaping the world’s current economic order. In the original form of the American-derived post-war international monetary system, the Bretton Woods system was a gold exchange standard with the US dollar (USD) as the only medium of exchange. Due to a long-standing conceit that interest rate jawboning by the Fed had cost Tricky Dick his first presidential election in 1960, the Nixon administration placed great weight on the power of the Federal Reserve System and its ability to both foster and direct American economic hegemony. At this time, in the Bretton Woods system of old, the essential status of the USD provided great international economic influence. But due to the very nature of international trade, which had been born at a time when gold was by far the internationally accepted store of value, the dollar had a tenuous hold on its global economic sway. The Bretton Woods System originally was constructed so that in order to exchange any national currency for gold, one had to first exchange that currency for USD. The USD was the only international currency that enjoyed this convertibility. As a result, all other currencies were pegged to it. It was a privileged position. Kinda like the United Kingdom enjoys being able to print British pounds as legal tender and still stay in the European Union. Only better. But Nixon wanted more. He sensed a bigger prize. Moreover, the original Bretton Woods system was creaking under the weight of its assumptions. The United States continued to expand its money supply, thereby putting pressure on its ability to maintain gold reserves to cover those held by foreign central banks. It was kind of a ruse. Most countries kind of expected that the US could not withstand a run on their gold deposits. Then in 1965, Charles de Gaulle announced his intention to call America’s bluff. He wanted the gold that was entitled to France by its enormous US dollar stockpile. As other countries began to follow suit, it seemed that a portion of the pillar of America’s economic might could easily be taken away. Switzerland and France announced their intention to redeem over $241 million of their dollar reserves for gold specie in 1971. More redemptions were on the horizon. In response, Nixon secretly cloistered his financial team at Camp David. Afterwards, he brashly severed the link between gold and the USD. The gold exchange standard was no more when Nixon made the following statement on national TV: “We must protect the position of the American dollar as a pillar of monetary stability around the world. In the past 7 years, there has been an average of one international monetary crisis every year… I have directed Secretary Connally to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets, except in amounts and conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and in the best interests of the United States.#### At the time, the “Nixon Shock” was seen as a short-term reactionary move designed to bully European allies into a desperately needed revaluation of their currencies. By 1973, however, all the major international currencies floated freely against each other 24 hours a day in an orgy of price movements without government intervention. This new form of the international financial system characterizes the “ultimate objective” (33) of Friedman’s seminal 1962 work Capitalism and Freedom. The end of the fixed exchange rate mechanism birthed the volatile high-stakes world of hedge funds and high-frequency traders, the unintentional trademarks of modern international finance. Friedman believed that a freely floating exchange rate system would be “highly stable because basic economic policies and conditions are stable” (69). In other words, economic reality would eventually reflect the theoretical perfection of economic theory. However, the Nixon Shock itself proved that economic policies are hardly, if ever, “stable.” Perhaps this utopian dream of classic neoliberal laissez-faire economics could have been realized upon a blank slate economy. But a greenfield did not exist. Many observers at the time claimed that Bretton Woods was dead. Retrospectives were authored. Lessons from the system’s demise were cataloged. But a funny thing happened on the way to the cemetery. The Bretton Woods “sister organizations” – IMF, the World Bank, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which later provided the framework for the World Trade Organization (WTO) – over time became increasingly powerful. And the main mechanism through which global central banks could intervene in the currency markets - their country’s exchange rate with the USD - was replaced by Friedman’s freely floating exchange rate regime. That freely floating mechanism, however, never became currency agnostic. Instead, and curiously almost, it maintained the premium on USD accumulation. Central banks had already amassed, and never redeemed, vast amounts of USD assets in their official reserve portfolios during the pre-Nixon era of full dollar convertibility into gold. Gold or not, it seemed they were hooked. Advantage: United States of America. The Federal Reserve has a global monopoly on currency. It literally can create out of thin air the world’s most valuable financial asset. That ability has profound ramifications on the means which other central banks can employ to stay relevant in international trade. As Barry Eichengreen put it in his excellent book Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International Monetary System: “It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries had to pony up $100 of actual goods in order to obtain one.” The international monetary order after the “Nixon Shock” was even more slanted in favor of the US. To underscore not only that a free-floating USD would not destroy the Bretton Woods regime but also the influence which the United States wielded at the Bretton Woods’ sister organizations, President Nixon’s TV announcement ending dollar-gold convertibility made sure to include the words “in full cooperation with the IMF.” 藍 Why do I laugh? Well let’s just take a look at how that worked out. And it doesn’t end there. It just keeps on rolling. You can check for yourself at the St Louis Fed website. The Fed just keeps printing money. We are at nearly $14 trillion in current M3 money supply with no end of the inflation (and corresponding dollar devaluation) in sight. So when I heard recently that Friedman had basically predicted the rise of Bitcoin, the preceding extensive backstory is why I took notice. has been the dream ever since we made up this thing called the internet. Because if even old Milton “The Business of Business is to do Business” Friedman was waiting for this “e-cash”, I wonder why the Federal Reserve System didn’t anticipate it. And more importantly, why are we still waiting for an official regulatory opinion? When it came to the Great Recession, we basically listened to Friedman. According to a 2011 report provided to the Federal Reserve Board, Edward Nelson stated, “in important respects, the overall monetary and financial policy response to the crisis can be viewed as Friedman’s monetary economics in practice.” He also claimed that “Friedman’s recommendations for responding to a financial crisis largely lined up with the principal financial and monetary policy measures taken since 2007.” I mean if we are going to continue on with letting Friedman theories dictate our monetary policy, we should be letting all cryptocurrencies “freely float”, right? Friedman’s emphasis on freedom as an a priori notion demands a light regulatory regime, no? Or has the entire bureaucracy governing American monetary policy stopped listening to Milton Friedman? Has the Fed forgotten its godfather?

But that’s what this article is about - the virtual currency that history has almost forgotten. Recently, at the Woodstock of Capitalism, Warren Buffett and his elder sidekick Charles Munger gathered to dish dirt, talk investing, and dispense folksy aphorisms at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. The Statler-and-Wardorf-type couple’s comments about cryptocurrency were one of the most referenced quotes, at least in my little circle of cryptoficionados, during the three day orgy of discounted shopping, investor presentations, interviews, a 5K, and most importantly STEAK!!! Qz reported the gist of the matter in a piece they published on May 5. Buffett warned, “Cryptocurrencies will come to bad endings,” while Munger claimed, “To me, it’s just dementia. It’s like somebody else is trading turds and you decide you can’t be left out.” But come on, one guy is 87 and the other is 94! You can’t expect them to understand crypto. Besides, these are the guys that missed Apple even as late as 2011 when they plowed over $10 billion into IBM as a supposedly superior alternative. Had they invested in The Big Fruit back when its founder Steve Jobs died, which many people at the time recognized was a very big and very juicy buying opportunity, they would have nearly quadrupled their money! As it stands, Berkshire exited IBM at a loss (Hey! You can’t win ‘em all). And they have a $45 billion-plus stake in the iPhone maker any way. To long-time followers of Buffett like myself, it must seem like we are getting close to Senile Buffett stage. It’s really Bizarro Land to see Berkshire have any tech stock, much less make it the single biggest investment position in the entire world for a non-fund. When I was a kid, the Buffett I knew didn’t invest in tech stocks because “there is no margin of safety” and he “just doesn’t understand” them. Well, things change it seems. And Buffett’s stance towards crypto will change, too. It’s my belief that if he had enough time remaining in his life, he’d come around to liking cryptocurrencies eventually as well. It may be some future as-yet-undreamed-of coin or, heck, it could even be Ethereum a few years from now! After all, this week also saw reports from Forbes nonetheless claiming that the tech wunderkind behind Apple himself, Steve Wozniak, “was extremely upbeat about Ethereum and described it as a platform that was just like Apple’s and could become as influential as his company became.” Why is it an inevitable conclusion that, if given the time, Buffett would eventually embrace crypto? Well, first of all, he sure did come around on Apple in the end, didn’t he? And second of all, well, that will require me to tell a story. So sit back and let me regale you with the tale of Blue Chip Stamps. Buffett biographer Alice Schroeder discusses the importance of one investment in particular that changed the trajectory of Buffett’s investment career. It was one of the few prescient buys that cemented the most important partnership of his life, bringing him the human version of Waldorf to his own Statler. From Schroeder’s excellent work The Snowball: He and Munger had also discovered another company they saw as promising and were buying as much stock of it as they could. This was Blue Chip Stamps, a trading-stamp company. They would buy it separately and together, and over the course of time Blue Chip would dramatically reshape the course of both men’s careers. To describe what Blue Chip was as a company, you must travel back to a post-war time when mothers and grandmothers paid for groceries with cash and often had a few choices for their daily shopping available to them within walking distance of their home. As part of the change from their transaction and as a way to encourage repeat business, they would receive a fistful of stamps, stamps that were essentially a marketing giveaway, an early version of today’s retail loyalty rewards programs. Customers eventually accumulated enough stamps to paste into little booklets and claim the modest reward of a blender, a television, a radio, a fishing rod, a tetherball set, etc. The most popular item to acquire with trading stamps was a toaster. These trading stamps were a fun free way to get cool stuff without influencing the rest of the household budget. Postwar consumers hoarded their stamps and collected books full of them and waited for when they could exchange those books for exotic items they would otherwise be unable to afford. By the 1960s, there were so many trading stamp companies vying for customers that the competition drove them to accept just about anything as long as it was equal to the cash value of the collected stamps, which was something like $1.60 per 1,000 stamps. Crazy acquisitions in history via trading stamp include a Cessna airplane, a pair of gorillas (5.4 million S&amp;H Green Stamps), a donkey for an overseas church missionary, an elephant, and a variety of special equipment vehicles like school buses, ambulances, and fire trucks. By 1964, industry leader Sperry &amp; Hutchinson alone printed three times as many stamps per year as the U.S. Post Office. When we reached “peak trading stamp bubble” (so to speak) in 1969, more than 80% of U.S. households collected them. The S&amp;H redemption catalog had a higher circulation than the Sears Roebuck, which for all you millennials out there is literally the company that defined what it meant to print a catalog. These loyalty stamps were the byproduct of a rapidly vanishing era of thriftiness. Never waste. Never want. Never go into debt. But what Buffett and Munger liked so much about Blue Chip was not the aura of their youth, but rather the monopoly on stamp production that Blue Chip enjoyed with its vast array of retail partners. This partnership served also to limit the supply of Blue Chip tokens, er, um, stamps. The result was a unique kind of virtual currency that had no intrinsic value beyond what people ascribed to them. And oh did people assign value to them! Not only were the exotic items mentioned previously acquired solely with trading stamps but, in their time, they were literally everywhere. Schroeder again quotes in her book: When you had all the major oil companies and grocers giving out a single stamp, it became like money. People would leave their change behind and take the stamps. Morticians gave out stamps. Prostitutes gave them… It was ubiquitous. Everybody had them. People even counterfeited them. Wait! How did such a sought after asset get unfairly maligned by the market? If everyone had these stamps, why would a bunch of value investors be able to cheaply buy them up hand over fist? The answer to that, my friends, is simple. And is also eerily reminiscent of the current crypto kerfuffle. Regulation. Stock in Blue Chip Stamps was so cheap because of the specter of regulation. (Sound familiar?). The Department of Justice had the company in their sights, eventually forcing it to sell a part of itself to the grocery chains that it had as its original customers. The industry original S&amp;H had served an antitrust suit against Blue Chip as well. There was a long line of potential lawsuits in the pipeline, too. But when some of these concerns came to the fore for a bit and shares dropped from a high of $25 to $13 a share, Buffett just kept right on buying, using whatever investment vehicle he had available to him at the time that had ready cash. It’s hard to tell exactly how much money Buffett and Munger made off Blue Chip Stamps - primarily because they used its dwindling cash flows to buy superb companies like See’s Candies and Wesco Financial, companies which are vital parts of their shared empire today. But rest assured, in today’s dollars, their profit would easily be measured IN THE BILLIONS. So let’s review, so the next time you hear about Warren Buffett hating on crypto, you too can recount the story of Blue Chip Stamps. Buffett and his most trusted investment partners sunk close to $100 million, which was at the time surely a princely sum, to buy a virtual currency of limited supply with no intrinsic value that was about to run the gauntlet against a whole host of regulators… And when they were in their 40s, they looked at this situation, not unlike the current cryptoasset markets at all, and decided upon one simple course of action: AWL EEN!

Sometimes the best way to think is to write. Wait. Not even sometimes. All the time. When you learn to edit yourself, that’s when you start to think. So here’s my effort at thinking. I want to conduct a crazy little thought experiment. I want you to imagine “real estate values in China” and think to yourself exactly, “What does a ‘nice house’ look like? “What does a ‘nice apartment’ look like?” Think to yourself: WHAT DOES $30 MILLION LOOK LIKE?Does it look like this? Picture: homesoftherich.net (This house is Fort Wayne, IN and is part of a sprawling estate worth $30 million.) Or maybe like this?Picture: luxify.com (This house is in Beverly Hills, IN and is also worth $30 million!) Now let me show you what $30 million of real estate value looks like in my neighborhood in Shanghai, China. Pictured here below is a modest little apartment building located reasonably near downtown Shanghai, China. It has 30 units, each about 75 square meters each. If you assume a value per square meter at about 80,000 CNY per m2 (and honestly that’s probably a little low at this point!), that’s a 600,000 CNY valuation per unit, or approx. $1 MILLION USD PER UNIT. Let’s check out what it look likes here: Yes, this measly squat little residential building you see pictured here represents $30 MILLION OF ASSET VALUE in the Chinese real estate markets of 2018. I don’t know why maybe other people, especially if they are Chinese, don’t think that’s crazy. But to me the contrast is quite stark. Let me explain… Best case scenario… if these units were all rentals… they would yield… in their current slipshod shape… about $250,000 per year in rental income, representing approximately a 0.83% yield. Clearly, the rationale for people buying Shanghai apartments today is not because they are income-producing investments. That leaves only the rationale that they are buying now in hopes of finding a “Greater Fool” later who is willing to buy at an even lower price-to-yield. But, I mean… 0.83% is already pretty low… especially to ask for an investment as large as $30 million. In the few decades of China’s private real estate industry, so far that “Greater Fool” logic has worked. But it’s not guaranteed to do that forever.

What’s that you say? China’s infamous “hot money” has been obsessed with only one pursuit pretty much in the past year: Investing in altcoins! What a lot of people have overlooked is just how much Chinese capital is tied up in the World Cup. The New York Times has been spilling a lot of pixels on this thesis lately. To wit: China Won’t Play in This World Cup. It Still Hopes to Profit. (May 30, 2018) China’s World Cup One Day? It’s Already Here (July 4, 2018) Chinese World Cup Sponsorship Not About Filling Gaps: FIFA (July 8, 2018) The World Cup Final’s Unconventional Start Time (July 13, 2018) Some highlights of this small cluster of articles: Due to corruption scandals in Russia and within the organization itself, FIFA had trouble selling its ad inventory until a “real lifeline came from a cluster of Chinese companies willing to pay hundreds of millions of dollars and save the day.” These companies included Wanda (cinemas and property development), Hisense (electronics), Vivo (smartphones), Mengniu (dairy products), and Yadea (electric scooters). Budweiser and McDonald’s, two of the longest tenured FIFA partners, these brands are not! Chinese tourists bought more tickets (40,000) to the games than even England supporters. Yes, those annoying guys who kept yelling “It’s coming home” for 3 weeks to anyone who would listen. There were more Chinese in Russia for the Cup than them! There are even Chinese children acting as flag bearers. FIFA even shifted the start of the World Cup final match forward by a few hours to give the Chinese market a fighting chance to stay up and watch the world’s largest televised event. And watch we did! Lots of us. Legitimate business interests are not the only providers of Chinese capital interested in the World Cup these days. On Friday the 13th of July, reports were published outlining a $1.5 billion World Cup gambling ring based in China that was using cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin specifically, to manage its books. Assuredly, that bust is just the tip of the iceberg, for Chinese culture is obsessed with gambling and get-rich-quick schemes in general. Just how much money left the cryptosphere for the fun times of World Cup prop bets and all-night drinking binges is, of course, impossible to tell. But data points like the $1.5 billion above give us a glimpse. Another strikingly correlated statistic is the total crypto market cap leading up to the start of the World Cup on June 14, 2018. Here is the data from Coinmarketcap from June 1 to today: Notice the decline from around $350 billion on June 10 to around $265 billion on June 14, the day of that most embarrassing opening game where Russia destroyed Saudi Arabia, 5-0. To me, that’s a clear consequence of betting capital (i.e. “hot money”) being moved from cryptocurrency exchanges to betting platforms both licit and illicit. Today’s action only confirms my hypothesis. The entire cryptosphere is up about 4.7% since Kylian Mbappé’s historical goal less than 24 hours ago. Time will only tell if this trend will continue. But I’ll go out on a limb and say I’m confident that it will. Why? To put it simply, Chinese mining pools control about 70% of the Bitcoin blockchain hashing power. Moreover, I’ve heard it said that just a little less than half of the capital that has entered the cryptomarket in the past 18 months has been from China. Plus, signalling from the widely recognized government mouthpiece Global Times indicates that bitcoin will soon get a reprieve from the Chinese government. An article titled Improved regulation makes more sense than just saying no to bitcoin in China was published just 2 weeks before the Cup. Lastly, if we’re truly headed into a Trump-induced trade war, and it looks like we are, bitcoin and its revolutionary ability to displace the US Dollar as an international reserve currency, just may be China’s real “trump card” if it wants to stay afloat in a battle of attrition. Putting all these bits and pieces together leads me to one important overriding conclusion that we can takeaway from the first truly Chinese World Cup ever.

Franchising, the drive-thru, the long-term property plays enhanced by development with OPM (other people’s money)… All of these inventions came directly from the mind of McDonald’s de facto founder, Ray Kroc. He was a genius. I’ve been a fan of Kroc since before Batman played him in The Founder, but if you haven’t seen that movie yet, it’s definitely worth a couple hours. If you’re a business strategy head like me, you might even want to watch it twice. Yeah sure, maybe he screwed over the ol’ McDonald brothers. But c’mon guys! Get that shit in writing! Moreover, he didn’t invent them but he created a corporate culture that led to the creation of more than a few products that enjoy a billion dollars in annual revenue: the Big Mac, Filet-o-Fish, and the Egg McMuffin to name just three. Today, August 6th, is apparently the 50th birthday of the BigMac and, to celebrate, Mickey D’s is giving out MacCoin to everybody who stands in line today in China. What is a MacCoin? Well, rumors were this promotion was actually going to involve cryptocurrency. It certainly would have been a much cheaper rollout if it had been, but it’s actually a hard coin.

A lot of people outside the US may not realize that American elections have been largely based on electronic voting machines ever since the 2000 election. If there were such a thing is an internet meme back then, “hanging chads in Florida” would have definitely made national headlines. Let’s revisit this ridiculous piece of American history. Imgur is waiting for your contributions! And for the win, my absolute favorite: Meme away, Internet! Hopefully someone somewhere out there reads my posts and we’ll get some nice work from the meme mines to spread about during the upcoming Trump-dominated mid-term election cycle. For those of you under 30, let me explain to you what a “hanging chad” is exactly. Before we used computers to automatically tabulate election results according to the data blindly entered into a private database controlled by a few poorly paid election officials, each voter used to fill out their voting preferences on an actual piece of paper. To automate this tedious process, we invented paper with a pre-cut dimple that voters were supposed to fully detach from the whole piece of paper in order to indicate their vote. Tabulation machines were then created that could be fed stacks and stacks of voting paper at a time to deliver election results quickly. A “hanging chad” looks like this: As you can see, it is literally impossible to tell the true intent of the voter. Did this chad become hanging due to the voter pressing it in? Or did it get caught up in the tabulating machinery and detach all by itself? This pedantic debate basically gave us George W. Bush. Weird, right? I know. In an effort to avoid this particularly weird debate in the subsequent 2004 presidential election, the US turned to digital voting machines to execute the election. However, as is often the case, solving one problem usually just leads to a host of new problems. Sure enough, with the not-as-close-but-still-pretty-close Bush v. Kerry presidential election came claims of digital ballot box stuffing, particularly in “purple” regions where the results were close enough that an extra 10,000 votes here or there striped into the protocol via programming “back doors” could swing an entire election. Such claims of corruption have persisted from both Democrats and Republicans to this day. Blockchain and crypto is the solution for ending this kind of corruption. NEM &amp; innovative projects like Agora are working on exactly that. NEM is a 3rd-generation blockchain that is focused on creating usable enterprise solutions. For instance, my company, DarcMatter, plans to utilize the hybrid public/private nature of their technology to better serve our customers. However, NEM has recently been focusing on the voting use case, having recently partnered with the Ukrainian government to help make democratic elections in that Eastern European nation more transparent and secure. Agora.vote is a fantastic Ethereum-based project that will hopefully help us secure democracy for the next generation. They have already assisted with an election in Africa and have recently come to an agreement with Diginex to provide voting systems in Asia. According to their website, blockchain-based voting is “tamper-proof, private, accessible, affordable, and tension-less.” That’s the way elections should be. Thanks, blockchain!

It just stings a little bit more when we do stupid things with our own personal finance. Since “those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it,” it’s always nice when someone is brave enough to come out and say, “Hey, look, I messed up. I’m gonna tell you about it so maybe you won’t make the same mistakes I did.” Thus, I recently read about the sad story of one Cryptohomie, a 32-year-old from Abu Dhabi. He borrowed a $126,500 personal loan from a UAE bank, which is apparently a simple thing to do in the land of oil wealth. That’s kind of a staggering amount that one can so easily obtain, but that’s not the point of this life lesson. What we want to know is… Why? To buy cryptocurrency. 廊 And don’t get me wrong! I loves me some crypto and blockchain investments. I have made (and lost) a bunch of money doing this type of investing. Being that this is steemit powered by STEEM and we are living through the Crypto Dog Days of Summer 2018, I’m sure that a lot of you, too, are in the same boat. Waiting for the next bull… or whatever. And god knows really when and/or if it will ever happen. “The night is always darkest just before the dawn.” That’s the usual drill. We’ll see if that happens again. I have a feeling that it will. But I have NO IDEA what will happen in the short run. But let’s get this straight, first and foremost, right here and now, young crypto Padawans… Never ever never ever ever borrow money to invest in crypto. It’s just stupid. Sure, maybe a little bit of light margin on a stock account. No more than 20%. That can be okay. At times. Like if you know you’re gonna get paid in the next few weeks and you see an opportunity that simply is just too juicy to pass up. But realize that it is still RISKY AF. But borrowing to buy cryptoassets? NO! That’s just nuts. The asset class is simply way too young and volatile to even be thinking about this kind of investment strategy. But yet, I know some people who are absolutely addicted to BitMEX and its leveraged bitcoin trading environment. In fact, I’ve even been in WeChat groups where people advocate leveraging short and long positions because “there’s just no other way to make money right now.” Uh-huh. Sure. You gone get REKT!

So usually the guards don’t let people that look like me into the posh UpBit customer service lounge that at one point last year was teeming with crypto traders nonstop. You see - in 2017, Korean exchanges opened up retail outlets to encourage investors to come in and directly contribute their paper fiat KRW into their crypto trading accounts. The practice led to a price disparity known as the Kimchi Premium that savvy international investors with access to the Korean crypto markets exploited for quick, easy gains. But I had a trick up my sleeve that would hopefully gain me access to the “Koreans only” interior of the trading lounge - I had a #Hashed coffee cup. Clearly, I must be important enough to let in, right? Currently, there are 152 coins and 269 currency pairs trading on Korea’s largest cryptoassets exchange by volume. But due to a police scare way back in early May, new users have perhaps been a bit gun shy about onboarding to the platform. There certainly were very few people there on the recent rainy day that I visited. But that’s all about to change! UpBit was cleared of any wrongdoings by a police investigation earlier this month. And Bithumb just announced it will finally allow new users to start opening accounts again TODAY on September 1. To quote from the NewsBTC article linked to above, “Considering that Bithumb and other leading cryptocurrency exchanges have not been able to facilitate new users since January, local analysts predict that a new wave of capital will hit the Korean markets.” In addition, Bithumb just stated they will be starting trade in two new fiat pairs for the altcoins Waltonchain (WTC) and IOT Chain (ITC). Having direct fiat onramps for these kind of esoteric coins is just nuts to me. But, hey, it’s Korea! Close to half of salaried workers in Korea invest in crypto. And that doesn’t even count the retirees who have also caught the crypto bug. That’s the statistic you hear bandied about so often in the Hashed offices in Gangnam District. Yes, Gangnam of the 3 billion-plus YouTube views, that Gangnam! Just think about how crazy that stat is. South Korea represents about 0.5% of world population and more than 30% of international cryptocurrency trading volume.

In my mind, it’s just a better all-around fundraising solution. It’s pretty clear that the easy money has been made in this industry. But that doesn’t mean that there aren’t a lot of opportunities out there to make life-changing investments. Now may be the perfect time to commit fresh capital to the cryptosphere due to the evolving nature of token-based capital raises. The blockchain asset industry is moving away from funding the dreams of “two geeks and a whitepaper” via public crowdsales, or what many people call initial coin offerings (ICOs), toward a dilution-free extension of the entrepreneurial runway via tokenized business offerings (TBOs). People just haven’t realized yet that that’s what is happening. ICOs, at least in the traditional way that we refer to them, are dead. The days of raising $40 million in an hour via the Ethereum network are gone, never to come back again. The plummeting value of ETH proves this maxim. No crowdsales, no use case for ETH, no value. That was the message I spread on Thursday September 6 at Let’s Talk Blockchain, a community event organizer sponsored by ViewFin, the company behind the very first Chinese cryptocurrency project Metaverse(ETP). The main thesis of my talk was that fundraising mechanisms are always evolving. The main idea that spurred the traditional ICO to prominence in 2017 is a reaction to the dramatically reduced access that regular folk have to the part of the capital markets where potentially life-changing, alpha-generating investments exist. The longer that bleeding-edge technology behemoths stay private, the less impact their going public has on the wallet of the common man. PE and VC whales, and the rich families and lucky individuals that fund them, get bigger and bigger. The hoi polloi minnows get more and more painted into the corner of workaday life. Traditional ICOs were supposed to disrupt that powerful trend. But, as is often the case with new movements, they were coopted by the very forces they were intending to displace. Such is the power of the dialectic. Private sales, read VC whales, and certainly not crowdsales, are how blockchain startups raise money these days. That looks like it is going to be the case for the foreseeable future. But that doesn’t mean that token-based capital raises don’t have a future! Token-based capital raises are just evolving, like all funding mechanisms do. Their next, better iteration is TBO. What is a TBO?A tokenized business offering (TBO) creates a tokenized ecosystem based around an existing platform solution that requires an easily verifiable utility token to unlock features of the platform. They may often require staking those tokens on a blockchain as a prerequisite for platform participants to perform work, and get compensated with utility tokens for that work, in the ecosystem. That’s my idea and I think it’s pretty useful in terms of wresting power away from the powerful forces of private money and giving some of that power back to entrepreneurs and their minnow investors directly. I’ll keep telling this story for as long as people are willing to listen. It’s that important to me, to investors, and to the overall future of the blockchain industry.

Once upon a time, we lived in a world where the mainstream media was the “fourth estate” and it acted as a check and balance on the other three estates. Incidentally, those are religion, nobility, and the common people. Back in the good old days, we could count on underpaid scribes like Bob Woodward to roost out the nefarious misdeeds of those in power, whether it be clergymen diddling altar boys, presidents directing thieves under cover of night, or the notorious Florida Man who is always out to do some kind of evil along the back roads of that awkward American state. But in these neoliberal modern times, where “the business of business is business” and society doesn’t let us question the motives of businessmen any more than that, the “fourth estate” has been coopted by the nobility. In the twenty-first century, that would be the rich people. Now that Trump is president, we can pretty easily state that the government is also the rich people, which is a happy &amp; convenient state of affairs - if you’re rich! Nowadays, fake news hits the 24-hour news cycle and the market instantly reacts. Even if people recognize the duplicity, it doesn’t matter because 80% of the trading volume in capital markets is commanded by bots. Those artificially intelligent software protocols automatically scan the day’s headlines and make immediate trading decisions. So fake news has a tremendous impact, especially in the crypto markets where bots and fake volume make up almost the entire market during bear cycles. This state of affairs means that the low volume days of a bear lull are especially prone to fake news attacks. As with anything that is so technologically fresh that it outpaces the formulation of the laws necessary to control it, scammers are everywhere. And they take all shapes. In reaction to the now debunked Goldman news, bitcoin (BTC) fell a maximum of almost 14% as a result. It still has yet to recover. Even with news that’s not really fake - like Vitalik Buterin stating the obvious that 1000x returns were a thing of the past - trading bots and capital deployed by those “in the know” can wreak havoc on cryptoasset prices across the board. But that’s how it is in financial markets without regulation. It just is. If we want that to change, we need to pressure our rich Congresspeople to do something about it. Otherwise, the 98% of the world that doesn’t know about cryptocurrency or blockchain assets will never be properly informed, much less convinced to place their hard-earned money into these types of investments. Contrary to popular opinion, regulation will not limit the crypto markets. It is the best and only chance we have of making them bloom! If the G20 governments don’t do it soon, the blockchain industry will find ways around it anyway. Decentralized exchanges and crypto havens like Malta and Lichtenstein will provide the answers. But those solutions will never be as satisfying as China, England, or the United States flat out codifying what everyone on Steemit already knows: Bitcoin is cool!And it’s a perfectly fine globally decentralized form of money that is ripe to disrupt a centuries-old corrupt-driven financial system coopted by the nobility. Go figure. Just like it took a Republican president (Richard Nixon) to open up “Red China” and a Democratic president (Bill Clinton) to deregulate the American financial markets completely (so that the richest among us could make a whole bunch of money before the system’s inevitable collapse in 2008)… Yeah, just like those two milestones required a counterintuitive action by a seeming opponent to the idea to make them happen, that’s what will happen with regulation and crypto. That’s just the nature of the dialectic. So, c’mon guys. Let’s face it. Let’s stop asking dumb questions. You know the ones I’m talking about! In case you forgot, here’s a list of silly questions cryptoasset investors ask in public chat rooms: When tokens? When exchange? When update? When moon? When Lambo? I mean, really… is that what this whole “blockchain will revolutionize the international financial system” is all about? The answer is no. HELL NO. To all of those questions. (I know, I know. That’s not even answer to some of those questions, but I think you get my point.) We need to be paying attention to a much more important question these days: When regulation? Whenever we get a firm answer to that burning question is when the whole blockchain industry will know that the bottom is in and the only way forward is up. Way up.

Real change that impacts lives and transforms society. Satoshi Nakomoto created Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology in the hopes that it might one day lead to a more equitable society where the distance between the haves and the have-nots was no longer as wide as an ocean and widening.

Those are the platforms we currently are on. If anyone else has any suggestions for cool podcast platforms, please let us know in the comments below.  So why did we choose the name Block Runners? Well, it’s totally based on the classic film Blade Runner, one of the all-time favorite films of my family. Based on Philip K. Dick’s amazing novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the film explores the dualistic nature of technology - its dialectic capacity to bring massive positive change to society as a whole while also containing within it the spectre of potential harms wrought by evil robots and malicious governments. Blockchain, like any bleeding-edge technology, contains both sides of this coin. In this way, our podcast will operate as a bladerunner, which is the character played by Harrison Ford whose goal it was to seek out a rogue robot trying to kill its creator.

Blockchain is a decentralized database. Period. There are also a lot of buzzwords that get associated with blockchain technology. Some people claim that these aspects are just means to deceive investors. Some people believe that blockchain projects can just focus on a few, or even just one, of these aspects to be a successful and positive contribution to the blockchain community and ecosystem. Even others, like bitcoin maximalist and BTCC founder Bobby Lee, believe that blockchain projects must focus on all of this laundry list of advantages in order to be considered a “true” blockchain project. Here is the list: A blockchain project should emphasize pseudonymity to give its users a modicum of privacy. A blockchain project should utilize permissionless consensus in order to allow anyone to participate in verifying transactions. A blockchain project should operate independently of any centralized authority. A blockchain project should transparently provide the information contained in its blocks of transactions so that the transaction log is universally and publicly verifiable by any and all who is interested to see it. A blockchain project should maintain an immutable record of its transactions so that information is 100% reliable. In combination, these aspects enable a “true” blockchain to focus without a third-party intermediary, thus earning its ultimate descriptive adjective: TRUSTLESS trustless Is that the whole point of blockchain? Projects like Ripple and EOS fly directly in the face of the strictest interpretation of this ethos. But the people who have been in this industry the longest, like Bobby Lee, all seem to gravitate towards this philosophy eventually. Does their experience lead them there? Or is it simply because being early investors in bitcoin have made them rich? Or have they done the 10,000 hours (or more) of research necessary to reach this enlightened conclusion? You may not agree with this perspective, but the strict bitcoin maximalist perspective is invaluable for letting us know how we got to here - the 10th anniversary of Satoshi’s bitcoin whitepaper - in the first place. Working in the blockchain industry, it seems part and parcel of the occupation to be constantly changing your opinion on what is and what is not a legitimate and worthy use case for the technology. That’s only natural, in my opinion. We are in a fledgling industry that has not established universal standards. There is new information that constantly informs and reshapes the world we think that is around us. Engaging in civil debate and constructive discourse will form the basis of this revolution. Not the petty squabbling we often see between various cryptocurrency factions. That’s why I listen attentively to old hands like Bobby Lee when they give a speech. It’s not like they haven’t considered what they have to say. In fact, they have a whole career behind them that forms the basis of their opinion. Nevertheless, I don’t have to agree with everything they say. That’s a healthy aspect of truthseeking. And when you get down to it, that’s what really blockchain is all about. We are seeking truth and hope to make it available to as many people as possible via blockchain. But I do agree with Mr. Lee when he says, “It’s not about the tokens or the advisors or the ticker symbol or the exchanges you list on… It’s about the products and services [that your company offers] if you really want to change the world.” Amen.

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about what exactly that means. I mean, upon further consideration, the word “trustless” seems like a bad word. Let’s check the tape then. What’s the actual definition of “trustless”? I went to the dictionary and checked it out. According to Dictionary.com, the word “trustless” means “untrustworthy, deceitful; distrusting, wary, suspicious.” Uh, that’s supposed to make me feel better about blockchain? We, as an industry, need to rethink this. I started thinking about this obvious conundrum a couple weeks ago when I saw notorious uber Bitcoin maximalist Bobby Lee give a highly entertaining speech in Shanghai. I then came across this strange feeling that something is just amiss about the way we talk about this topic in general once again while researching the 4th episode in our Block Runners podcast series about “Proof of Work” (coming out soon!). We need to wrap our heads around this concept of “trustlessness” because it lays at the very foundation of why blockchain technology is revolutionary. As The Economist put it in an article on the 7th anniversary of Satoshi Nakomoto’s whitepaper in 2015, it is this aspect which “makes possible a currency without a central bank.” Thankfully, I’m not the first person to call out the misnomer that using the word “trustless” in reference to a blockchain is. For that, I look to the wonderful Preethi Kasireddy. Her February 5 Medium article on the subject, “ELI5: What do we mean by ‘blockchains are trustless’?” is a great resource. A truly “trustless” transaction can only occur when the two parties engaging in the transaction are in physical proximity to one another. All other non-present transactions require some form of intermediary to replace the trust that can only be earned by actually looking someone in the eye and shaking their hand while you are engaging in an exchange of value. However, this setup is clearly limited and in no way facilitates the scaling of a global payment network. So how exactly does blockchain help to revolutionize the transfer of value instantaneously and globally? Is this conceit a myth? Not really. We’re just using the wrong words to talk about what is going on here. To quote Ms. Kasireddy: In a “centralized” system, we trust a single third party (e.g. Chase Bank) to act as the intermediary who guarantees those two properties [sender authenticity &amp; currency validity] ; in a “decentralized” system, our trust is placed elsewhere, namely in public-key cryptography and a “consensus mechanism” that allows us to determine the truth. Essentially, instead of trusting in a centralized party, when we conduct a transaction on a public blockchain, we are placing our trust in an entire ecosystem of distributed trust. Or as Kasireddy puts it, using a public blockchain means that we are “trusting everyone in aggregate.” All of the developers, miners, and users of that blockchain that have ever existed up to that point in the distributed ledger. It’s kind of like jumping into a swimming pool full of warm water, whereas dealing with a bank is like jumping into a potentially ice cold bath full of hammerhead and Great White sharks. You tell me which one you’d prefer.

My friends and I, who have begun their blockchain journey at different times, started a little podcast called Block Runners in order to provide the community with a quality resource to satisfy its collective curiousity. This week in our podcast we discussed one of those fundamental concepts of blockchain that sometimes people tend to gloss over: Forks. Bear sculpture from Gary Hovey So let’s begin with the most basic question… What the fork is a fork?The short answer is that when an existing blockchain is forked it creates two new chains at the block height of the fork. At the point of the fork, the two blockchains would start to create new transaction histories distinct from one another. But all blocks of transactions created before the block where the fork takes place would be the same on both chains. The newly forked chain shares the history of all previous transactions made on the parent chain. As it creates its new history, it does so according to a new set of rules. This procedure is, technically, a hard fork and that’s where the fun begins! Just like fancy silverware, there are different kinds of forks that have different uses. Source It’s free money!As a finance professor, I approach the question from, predictably, a finance perspective. A fork can be well compared to a spin-off IPO of an unwanted, or incompatible, subsidiary in the stock world. For example, processed foods giant Conagra recently spun-off its frozen potato products division into an entirely new and separately traded company, Lamb Weston (LW). Some investors reinvest earnings from forked coins back into BTC, others accumulate a fat wallet of forked coins on the off-chance that maybe they will be as valuable as BTC one day. But this is very dangerous! You need to do your due diligence on these projects or you might miss your opportunity to maximize profit, as we’ll see below. It’s an upgrade!My podcast cohost, Mr. Lo, contributes a developer’s perspective. The word “fork” has multiple meanings in software development depending on the context. Most recently, the term has been used as an integral part of the process of social software development, a practice made more efficient when Linus Torvald, creator of Linux, unleashed git to the world. Forking allows collaborators on git-based code repositories to organize a project in a decentralized manner. Each contributor has a copy of the original project (OP) and makes changes and improvements locally that they submit as pull-requests to the OP. It’s just a part of the workflow where you “fork” a copy of the code in order to experiment with it. For blockchain projects, a “fork” is an upgrade mechanism. If the “fork” is based on consensus, the blockchain doesn’t change. If there are political or philosophical differences, the “fork” can lead to a new coin and a split in the developer community. What kind of forks are there?There are three basic types of forks: unintentional, soft fork, and hard fork. Unintentional forks occur in a proof of work consensus system when two miners simultaneously find and broadcast a block to the network. Some miners will hear about one discovery and will start mining on that block, while another set of miners hear about another discovery and starting mining on that one. This confusion causes two concurrent chains to be constructed with slightly different histories. As a protocol, nodes accept the longest chain as the valid chain. In time, one chain will get ahead of the other and that chain will be the sole accepted chain again. Due to this possibility, miners have adopted a rule of thumb to wait for six block confirmations. If there are six block confirmations after the block containing your transaction, the chances that your transaction resides on the longest block is virtually 100%. Soft forks are backward compatible with the old chain. New block rules are more strict and follow a subset of the old block rules so they coexist in the same chain. Miners can choose to adopt the change and if a certain amount of support is generated, the change will be adopted by the network. Hard forks are when a new chain is incompatible with the old chain. This incompatibility happens if the upgrade causes nodes to reject blocks generated by the old node client software. Nodes must simultaneously switch to the new software in order to continue accepting and generating blocks on the new chain. Hard forks are generally used when there is consensus around a network change. Sometimes you just gotta upgrade that software. This type of hard fork, which enjoys consensus of all the miners on the chain, can be called an intentional hard fork. This very STEEM blockchain has conducted 20 hard forks with community consensus that, although they may have been a hassle to the community, provided robust upgrades and wholesale changes to the protocol. However, if a hard fork does not enjoy consensus, splitting the network can have dire consequences for the system. The community may splinter into two warring factions due to political or philosophical differences. What are the most important forks in crypto history?In the short history of blockchain, there are two fork events that every crypto enthusiast should know about. The first occurred on July 20, 2016 when developers on Ethereum, led by Vitalik Buterin and Consensys among others, rolled back the DAO hack and created a fork on the Ethereum blockchain. The coders that disagreed with this decision stayed on the Ethereum Classic chain. They were apparently okay with this little bit of crypto history: The second must-know fork occurred on August 1, 2017 when, again due to philosophical differences, a subset of BTC miners chose to create a fork of the bitcoin core code in order to increase the block size of BTC blocks from 1 MB to 8 MB. This fork created Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Both of these forks represent contentious hard forks. By contrast, In general, knowing about forks in the blockchain industry is important because, as we like to say on Block Runners, we want to delineate the good from the bad. Although many forks occur due to legitimate divergences in philosophy, some of these projects are outright cash grabs! If you want to determine the quality of your forked coins, we suggest checking the project’s activity on GitHub and the LinkedIn profiles of project leadership. If you find yourself questioning the future of the project after that little bit of research, sell those forking coins!

The only thing I can say is: Be ready. So it was when I was asked a couple days before a Shanghai fintech event held at the posh Ritz-Carlton Hotel in the Lujiazui financial district of Pudong by Profit &amp; Loss, a London-based monthly business magazine that covers the FX (foreign exchange) currency and derivative markets. Blockchain and cryptocurrency is an admittedly very small part of this universe, but P&amp;L is visionary enough to realize that the sector is certain to be part of the way forward. They even have a new magazine targeted toward institutional investors specifically for blockchain assets. It’s called On The Block. Such was the scenario in the precious few hours I had to spare to prepare for the fintech panel I was to be on at the Profit &amp; Loss conference. I used that time to gather my thoughts about the current state of these edge markets. It was an interesting experience and I thought, “Hey, why not share my thoughts here in a series of posts?” So here you go. Question 1: Everyone always talks about fintech “disrupting” financial markets. Is it really that disruptive of a force? Will fintech companies prove to be competitors or partners to financial services firms?#As usual, complex phenomena are never really well characterized in black-and-white. Similarly, fintech firms should be arrayed along a spectrum between disruptor and partner, not as either one or the other. Over time, even that essential nature is destined to fluctuate over time. Visa has got to be THE example of OG fintech. Fintech before it was so cool to shorten those seven hard-to-pronounce syllables (“financial technology”) down into the two that we know and love so much today. Bank of America started Visa in 1958. They called it BankAmericard. Ironically, the innovative concept was born via a concept that should be very familiar to the connoisseur of blockchain assets. Yep, the Visa phenomenon began when Bank of America “airdropped” 2 million credit cards on the state of California in 1958. They lost over $20 million in the endeavor. The pioneers that thought up the whole project were fired. But, in the end, the company had proven the viability of an all-purpose revolving credit card account. Today, the publicly listed company that became Visa Inc. (V) is now worth more than $300 billion. Thus, the core motivation for fintech has been, and always will be, disruption. But, technically, that disruption can come from within the very establishments that need to be disrupted. So, the role of a fintech company is destined to vacillate between disruptive competitor and partner. The key, simply, is to create an environment where the five competitive forces, as theorized by Harvard professor Michael Porter, can be unleashed upon, and sustainably exist within, the market. To return to the example of Visa, it started as a disruptor of its own company. So much so that Bank of America had to move the company out of its control in 1970. Shhhhhh! 狼Don’t tell any long-term BAC stockholders they could have had an extra $300 billion asset that would basically double the value of their stock. Under private ownership of a collection of international banks, Visa settled in for decades as an indispensable intermediary for the traditional financial services industry. From disruptor to partner in about 15 years. Time moves a little faster these days, of course. Thanks to the exponential nature of technology’s S-curve. Square is a perfect example of a “fintech disruptor” these days. The “other company” founded by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is now worth 20% more than the microtexting platform that made him famous. Square is a bleeding-edge US fintech company that is “revolutionizing” (this is the vocabulary of fintech disruptors!) the small business payment services, accounting, and business analytics industry. And, oh yeah, it has a Cash app that has more users than Paypal and lets you buy Bitcoin. And guess what? Visa owns 10% of it. Disruptor, yeah. But also, eventually, partner. That’s the nature of the relationship between new fintech and traditional finance. Like yin and yang, they both need each other to evolve and succeed.

Ethereum is lower than I’ve ever seen it, except for that time my buddy told me to look into it back when it was trading at $11. You know that guy. He didn’t buy it either, but somehow he knew about it in early 2016. Somehow. Maybe we’ll get that chance again, buddy! Dark days indeed.# YouTube cryptocurrency advocates are jumping off the figurative bridge like lemmings and “blockchain enthusiasts” all over the world are, at best, crying in their beer. A lot of them are taking the label “blockchain enthusiast” off of their LinkedIn profile. Maybe even for good. This classic meme has lost a couple of its job descriptors. How sad! But the wind keeps blowing. As it tends to do, the water keeps flowing down to the sea. People are still investing in blockchain. Yesterday, one huge $16 million investment was made by the big boys, Fenbushi Capital, Michael Novogratz, Block.one, OKcoin, et al., in a blockchain gaming startup named Mythical Games. The venture was founded by an impressive array of gaming executives with roots at Activision, Blizzard, and Yahoo. It’s cool stuff. Check it out. So where do I think this market is headed from here?I honestly don’t know. For months, I held to the glimmer of hope that we would not go below the old Bitcoin Cash FUD low from around this time last year. Yeah, that was from back when the last time old Faketoshi got a stick up his butt and started getting angry about god knows what. Boy, was I wrong! So in reality, I think that this downward spiral is not fully over. But I would say that prices are just beginning to look reasonable around here. Finally. I am definitely enjoying the cheap STEEM. We’ll see if I pick up anything else in the near future. Every day that we have a reasonable industry is another day where we rid ourselves of the scammers &amp; fraudsters that ruined this fledgling young industry throughout the past year. Like Nietzsche said, “Whatever doesn’t kill us makes us stronger.” Those are the only words of comfort I can think of right now. And I think cases like this pressICO one that I read about today are exactly what he meant. Oh, just looking at this website for their ICO makes me mad. It’s so easy to scam people with slick graphics and a litany of empty promises. Agggghhhhh! So good riddance to this Jerry Ji Guo guy. Have fun rotting in a federal prison. I look forward to hearing more stories like this one in the coming months. But that’s one less scammer/fraudster hype man piece of trash that will distract us from the long-term goal of using blockchain to make the world a better, more equitable, and transparent place. My heart goes out to David Ritter and my friends at Penta for getting duped by this scum. But hey, it happens. And when it does, there’s only one thing left to do: Keep BUIDL-ing your startup!

What’s that? You thought it was already here and went long on BitMEX with 100x leverage? On that kind of trade 15% of your position just goes to cover the fees! Whoops… and… it’s gone. That’s what they say these days at least. The once powerful meme mines of Crypto Land have been recently reduced to repeating South Park over and over again. These are desperate times, but we haven’t hit despair yet. (More on that later.) The only question to ask now is, “How low can you go, bitcoin?” The question is hella appropriate given the growing likelihood that King Bitty is definitely drunk on vacation on some tropical island playing a game of Limbo. Ethereum has gone off to Antarctica, a place no one, not even good old VB, ever thought it would ever go again. Double digits. The poor kid’s fortune has gone from something like a half billion to somewhere around $50 million. If he cared the least bit about money, he’d probably be devastated. But the best minds in crypto - VB, Charles Hoskinson, Matt Spoke - DGAF about money. They kinda guessed the nature of the people that had come into the space in 2017 and 2018, as evidenced by this quote from VB, “I’m skeptical that people involved in cryptocurrency are better people than people involved in the banking system.” That’s a nicely sobering thought for a 24-year-old. And while pretty much every other altcoin is down a dizzying amount, most more so than the Big Daddy BTC, we and the entire blockchain industry really need to keep in mind another VB quote from that same Forbes interview, “If crypto succeeds, it’s not because it empowers better people. It’s because it empowers better institutions.” Investor psychology can be a real bitch. Especially when there are no accepted valuation models to properly value cryptocurrencies. As such, the capitulation downswing in a blow off phase like the one happening during this bloody weekend in crypto is being driven completely by investor psychology. Thus, it can go quite a ways down. Note in the following life cycle of investment, though, that capitulation is not the last stage in the investor sentiment cycle. Yes, it is the stage which can encompass the longest and most significant price decline in percentage terms, but it is only after a very healthy dose of capitulation that we get to despair, where we can then, and only then, finally start to hope and dream about a “return to the mean.” Never mind the dizzying heights of the “New Paradigm”!!! I think we still have a little ways to go still before full despair, but god knows we’re a whole lot closer to it than when the bell rang on the stock market on Black Friday. These 24/7/365 markets really do a number on investor psychology. That’s why it’s probably best to prepare yourself going forward like a Zen Master would. So I’ll leave you with this little great resource from OptionAlpha in the hopes that we all, myself included, can do better next time. And to remember what our emotions feel like, really viscerally feel them and capture them, when it’s time to buy… and when it’s time to sell. In the meantime, everybody… Limbo!

I just downloaded this great iPhone app called @partiko, which is just about the best Steemit client that I’ve ever used.

Doing anything on my phone is revolutionary! But let’s get back to the theme I’ve been harping on the past couple days: Risk and long-term investment. If you’re new to this blog, you can check out those posts here: On Capitulation and Bitcoin’s Bloody Black Friday Weekend Yes, These Are Dark Days. But People Still Grindin’ That’s kind of my thing. And, like pretty much everyone, it’s something I am trying to get better at understanding and doing the right thing for my portfolio no matter where we are at in the market cycle. Which, finally, brings me to today’s topic: Starbucks How can Starbucks help you better understand long-term investment?#Well, it’s simple really. As recently as June, Starbucks (SBUX) was at multi-year lows. It traded at $47.37 per stub the week of June 25. Even in China, where I live, analysts were talking up the threat of new arrivals on the coffee scene, Luckin Coffee and CoffeeBox. Armed to the brim with gallons of piping hot VC money, the argument went, these two new upstarts were primed to take market share away from the Old Green Mermaid via heavy discounting, free delivery, and savvy social media marketing. China is massively important to Starbucks’ share price as it is one of the key means of volume growth for the brand. And guess what? Just over 4 months later, the stock traded at an all-time high (ATH), having reached $68.98 per share in early November. What did Starbucks do different? Nothing much, really. They tuned out the noise and just kept executing on their plan. Open up a couple Starbucks per day in China. Copy the good parts of your competitors and leave out the bad. They reached a delivery deal with the best food delivery app in China, ele.me, and basically just kept on grindin’. That’s what you have to do, both as an entrepreneur and an investor. Keep your head down and stick to the plan. After all, you must have had a good reason for that plan in the first place. But as my daughter often says while stamping her feet when she can’t figure out how to do something, “It’s soooo hard. I don’t wanna!” Believe me I know, it’s not easy. But we’ve got to keep our composure. Not get too high, not get too low. Think critically and rationally, NOT emotionally. Every year, I contribute the max to my daughter’s Coverdell Savings Account. It’s a great little way for Americans to save for college. I buy one stock a year of a brand I think she will look back on, whenever she’s old enough, and approve of. Something she can look back on and say, “My daddy was SO smart when he bought that stock for me!” When she was born, I bought her $2000 worth of Starbucks. So I’ve ridden the emotional rollercoaster of the chart above. There’s self-doubt, self-loathing, all the nasty little psychological quirks that come up when a thing you’ve researched well enough to invest in just doesn’t perform the way you want it to. Ugh, it’s horrible! But it happens. And no matter what happens, it’s probably gonna keep happening. So get used to it. Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.

So far, you could say the project has kinda been a success.  You may find the first post in this series here: Blockchain Fintech: Disruptors or Partners? Blockchain and cryptocurrency is a part of the vast fintech universe, but P&amp;L editor Galen Stops is visionary enough to realize that the sector is certain to be a big part of the way forward. P&amp;L even has a new magazine targeted toward institutional investors specifically for blockchain assets. It’s called On The Block. I encourage y’all to check both of these websites out. In preparing for the panel, the luminescent Mr. Stops asked me my thoughts on a few different questions. I’ll be presenting my considerably more considered (at least compared to my verbal responses during the actual panel) answers here in a series of posts. So please hit the “Follow” button up above if you like how I answer Galen’s question here today: Question 2: Do you see fintech actually changing business models in financial markets?#For this question, Galen gave me the following context: Everyone I speak to these days describes their business model in terms of tech firms. “We’re building a platform that gives clients everything in one place - it’s like the Amazon model,” or, “We’re matching up people who have excess credit with people who need it - we’re like the airbnb of credit,” or, “We’re not going to charge for brokerage on the platform, we’ll make all of our money selling data, like Facebook.”#That’s the current fintech entrepreneurial landscape out there. There are these accepted business models that are flying around, which are basically platform business models. I really think those kind of older ideas still have a lot of potential, especially were they to be combined with a cryptoeconomic layer! 邏 Here is the rest of my answer: The core motivation for fintech is disruption. Legacy finance systems are simply too cumbersome. They’re such an easy target. For example, when Alipay came along, Chinese banking systems were just screaming to be disrupted. Here’s pretty much an example of what I see when I peek over the bank teller’s shoulder here in China whenever I have to deal with the banks. Typically, this experience lasts at minimum one hour and averages about 2 hours of excruciatingly wasted time. I got this image from a great article at Planet Mainframe. Seriously, that’s what beautiful, simple mobile applications are competing with. Being fintech in this day and age is so easy, right!? On the technology side, even today, when I go to open up a new checking account, the antique green-screen systems strain under the weight of something as simple as inputting my name in English characters. On the regulatory side, I can’t tell you how much time we’ve spent just trying to get all the paperwork in order so that my company can legally send money to itself, just from one subsidiary to another. Both aspects are maddening! Pushing old antiquated systems to upgrade and modernize by introducing an element of Michael Porter’s five competitive forces, the very real threat of substitute products, is doing the global economy a great and necessary service. Of course, when you say the words “China” and “fintech” in the same conversation, you’d be quite remiss if you did not mention Jack Ma’s Alipay, which now exists under the umbrella of financial conglomerate Ant Financial. How the payment system for Alibaba’s e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall got reorganized from its parent company is a whole nuther story, however. For now, let’s just focus on the innovation side of Alipay. Alipay was this massive new paradigm shift, a classic Chinese “leapfrog” from doing things mostly the way they had been done since the 1960s with mountains of paperwork and hours, days, and weeks of waiting to a modern streamlined natively digital process for transferring value from one user to another. For those of you who don’t live in China, using Alipay basically looks like this most of the time: img src I mean it wasn’t that long ago that you would be charged a pretty hefty sum in China for transferring money from an account in your own name at a bank in one city to another account, at the same bank, in a different city. Uh… But that’s just how banking regulations seem to work. In China, in the US, everywhere! Banks as an industry are just slow as molasses. When Silicon Valley realized what a slow-moving target this gigantic industry was, their mouths just started watering. We’re still experiencing the impact of their attempts at revolutionizing finance today. No doubt we, as consumers, will continue to benefit for a long time to come. That being said, I don’t think we’ll see something like Alipay - this comprehensive platform for nearly every kind of financial service that caters to 500 million plus users - ever again. There were just so many unique converging factors that created that product that I don’t think it can be repeated. For example, Alipay operated in a sandbox with no competitors and no regulation for years. It was only after Alipay had established itself as the de facto market leader that the Chinese government forced it to obtain the proper license, a license that had at that point never existed before. As a result, it is my opinion that new fintech products will focus on niche solutions. For example, DarcMatter, where I currently work, simply provides a platform that offers a much more transparent and easier process for retail high net worth individuals (HNWI) to invest in great risk-adjusted products. We’re connecting funds that are constrained by regulation to investors that would have otherwise never heard of them. That’s our niche. Another great company that is in our same office space is Liqease, which is powered by the Traxia (TMT) cryptoeconomic token. All their platform business is trying to do is to make it easier for small businesses to monetize their receivables in an efficient and profitable manner. These kinds of fintech solutions are just win-win, or even win-win-win, for all parties involved. That is the point of niche business models in a nutshell. Unlike Too Big To Fail (TBTF) banks that try to be this one-stop shop for all retail and corporate banking needs, the nimble fintech-powered alternatives are all pretty much focused on one particular vertical. Venmo, PayTM, AirPay, Square, and various crypto payment solutions like Bitpay or TenX or OmiseGo are all vying to grab market share in one sector or another of this enormous global cross-border micropayments industry. Whatever success they achieve will lead them to leverage whatever user base they can grab to develop an ecosystem around their product, but it’s not necessarily a “walled garden” as was the intention of so many of the original platform solutions that were built. This kind of niche strategy makes it easy to stay flexible and pivot to wherever opportunity arises, like in the way that Square’s Cash app all of a sudden started accepting Bitcoin payments during the BTC Bull Run. The real question is can these new players amass a large enough user base fast enough to be a real threat to well-capitalized institutions. It’s certainly possible, but like I said in my previous answer in this series I think it’s more likely they get folded in as trusted service providers. But you never know. Blockchain, fintech &amp; crypto is such an incredibly fast-moving space that, just at the moment where you think you know what is going on, you lose the melody and have to tap back in on the beat.

Unfortunately, humans have been conditioned since neolithic times to run away as fast as we can from risk, screaming at the type of our lungs, “Do not go there! There is a BEAR over there! And he’s baring his big ugly teeth! Everybody RUN!” Thus, when markets get hairy, retail investors tend to always overshoot the mark and overcompensate for their losses. In other words, in risky markets, we are more likely to do what we know we should not. We buy high and sell low. It makes us feel better. After all, there is a Big Bad Bear RIGHT OVER THERE.  This phenomenon is the classic “moment of despair” that I referred to in my article last week, “On Capitulation and Bitcoin’s Bloody Black Friday Weekend.” If we see any more downside from here in the crypto markets (and chances are high that we will), it will be most definitely related to this investor psychology. In order to be better investors, we have to intimately understand our own personal relationship to risk as well as our own primordial urges as a species. The fight-or-flight response conditions the way everyone responds to stress. There’s no way around it. So we just have to understand it. When we perceive stress, our body’s sympathetic nervous system initiates a series of automated physiological responses: dilated pupils, elevated heart rate, pale skin, and body trembling. The release of a whole flood of hormones mostly causes these physical reactions. The main hormone that is secreted into the bloodstream is adrenaline, which basically makes a person act like they have drunk a whole case of Red Bull. The more stress you perceive, the more adrenaline your body makes. Why? The adrenaline helps you fill your lungs with air and pumps blood to all the extremities of your body so you can run away from THAT BEAR.  So it makes sense that in a bear market, most investors are running away as fast as they can. But what happens in a BULL market? In that situation, which cryptocurrencies experienced all throughout the latter half of 2017, retail investors don’t even think about risk. It kinda looks like this: Do you see that little tiny four-letter word below the bull? That’s risk. And in a bull market of screaming gains where even the newest noob is pocketing 400% returns, that’s what risk is. A four letter word that you dare not mention. That’s the unfortunate part. In financial markets, risk is actually the highest when prices are relatively high and no one is talking about risk. Everyone around us is doing it. It’s as if they are all saying, “Come on in! The water is fine!” We as investors have to condition ourselves to do the exact opposite of what our hormones want us to do. We know what we have to do. The greatest investors of all time have told us over and over again exactly what to do. First, there was Lord Rothschild: Then it was Rockefeller: And finally, we have Buffett: These are the best investors in the history of mankind. They all echo this same sentiment. Do the opposite of your fight-or-flight reaction. Yet, time after time, in bull markets, retail investors never take their gains, almost always top up their investments at the height of the bull market, hold on to their losses for far too long, and eventually sell at the worst possible time at the very nadir of the market. How can we avoid the fight-or-flight trap?Investors must familiarize themselves with their own most intimate, visceral emotions. Study and reflection may help you to dive deep into that abyss. When you do, you turn the bear from that toothy, violent fella above into a cute cuddly teddy that you can deal with. Remember that it’s better to Run toward the Bear and flee from the Bull.That’s the essence of contrarian investing. Have a great day everyone.

Blockchain Meetupto discuss# The Future of Digital Asset Investment: Platforms, STOs &amp; RoboadvisorsWith the recent swoon in the token markets and collapse in the ability to raise funds using cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, savvy investors must ask themselves a simple question. What’s next in digital asset investment?Join us for an evening on Thursday, December 6 at 7:00 p.m. to discuss this exact question at Hashed Lounge in the world famous Gangnam district of Seoul, South Korea. Who are we?We are DarcMatter, a US-based alternative investments platform designed to connect sophisticated investors with asset managers seeking investment. Our mission is to enhance capital flow, transparency, and efficiency for both sides of our platform participants. We are currently in the midst of decentralizing our platform in a regulatory compliant fashion. DarcMatter is part of #Hashed’s investment portfolio and is one of 14 “#Accelerating Projects” in the #Hashed incubator. What does DarcMatter think?DM is particularly excited about the future of Security Token Offerings (STOs) and believes it to be a natural evolution in the token investment industry. Utility tokens will certainly have their place in the ever-evolving token landscape, but we believe the time for STOs to shine is near. We are also excited about the potential of roboadvisors in the fund management space, which is why we have invited Qara.ai to speak at our event about their customized solution to limit risk using online AI deep learning algorithms. What is an STO?The vast majority of security tokens are likely to represent tokenized equity in a firm or other asset. They are therefore easy to regulate under existing US securities laws. This regulatory clarity should provide a much more sound basis for institutional investment. What is a roboadvisor?Roboadvisors provide financial advice to retail investors with little to no human intervention. The use of mathematical rules and data analysis reduces the labor cost for the firm, which generates cost savings for the investor. To learn more about these topics and more, come see us at Hashed Lounge in Seoul on Thursday, December 6!

At first, I just thought the cross set against the backdrop of the mountainous skyline looked pretty cool, but then my colleague told me that this was the largest church in Seoul. So, this morning of course I did a deep dive on the internet and found out that not only is this church the largest one in Seoul, but it has THE LARGEST CONGREGATION IN THE WORLD. Yoido Full Gospel Church was founded in 1958, expanded quickly, and moved to its current location in “the Manhattan of Seoul” (Yoido Island) in 1973, long before the National Assembly and the Korea Stock Exchange set up in this area. This church has dominated the world pentecostal scene since 1981 when the LA Times first recognized it as the largest congregation in the world. Back then it had only 200,000 people. Today it has around 800,000 people that attend its services. The Guinness Book of World Records stillrecognizes Yoido Full Gospel as having the largest congregation in the world. The sermons are translated into something like 17 languages and, of course, there are numerous satellite buildings around the 12,000-seat main hall that accommodate the overflow worshipers that are there for every service.

Before I found Steemit, I wrote extensively on Quora. I think it was because they used this cryptoeconomic-like reward system, which they have now abandoned. I never understood why. It, like Steemit and Reddit, rewarded you for posting stuff that other people upvoted. As you accumulated more Quora points, you got more sway in the ecosystem. Hey! It’s better than Facebook, where you post every intimate thing for free and get nothing in return but spam and political trickery. If you’re interested in reading the original book review, that’s the link. Here we go. Let’s start with a little picture I took while wandering around Nanjing. A recent picture of Nanjing being rebuilt. Ever since I moved to China in 2011, I have wanted to read a book like Wade Shepard’s Ghost Cities of China: The Story of Cities Without People in the World’s Most Populated Country, published by Zed Books in 2015. Since living these past six years in Beijing and Shanghai, I have developed the habit of going on long, meandering walks through unfamiliar parts of the city. During these excursions, I quickly noticed that the older, decaying communities near where I lived, the very enclaves that gave my adopted hometowns their unique character, often transformed into piles of rubble without notice. I was left to wonder… Where did that noodle shop go? What happened to that great jianbing guy? How about those kids that were playing in the street just last week? Sometimes in the week after the destruction of an urban village, masons would build a wall around the newly “freed” land. Sometimes the lot just lied in ruin for months. And sometimes construction workers and equipment immediately swooped in and began the process of transmogrification into vertical gray-black office spires. White collar workers then spent their day there, perhaps grabbing a coffee at lunch in the overpriced branded cafe on the first floor, and vacated the premises at the end of the business day in favor of apartments in newly built skyscraper boxes on some other newly “freed” land plot, perhaps over an hour or two away in the suburbs. A neighborhood that once teemed with activity at all times of the day and night was left eerily empty in the dark. What is the logic behind this process? I knew that Chinese real estate was ridiculously expensive, but never quite grasped all of the complex machinations that facilitated its development from communal property into a quasi-private form of individual financial asset for the laobaixing. Thankfully, Wade Shepard provides a thorough primer on the subject. Because approximately one-fifth of China’s GDP is related to the real estate industry, anyone interested in the contemporary Chinese economy should read this thoroughly entertaining and highly informative book. Wade Shepard is an experienced freelance journalist. His crisp and clean writing style reflects years on the beat for Forbes, South China Morning Post, and countless other reputable sources. The book is based on two-plus years of research, travel, and interviews with experts and people on the ground. His clear, no-nonsense approach is a welcome reprieve for this professor, who probably reads too many academic articles and dissertations converted for publication. Ghost Cities comes in at just over 200 pages and is comprised of ten mostly narrative-based chapters. The first and last chapters serve as introduction and conclusion without being termed as such. Chapters 2 through 9 address the variety of topics needed to understand the unprecedented and uniquely Chinese phenomenon of large-scale urbanization. “Clearing the Land” (Chapter 2) describes the nature and necessity of local government land sales to private developers. Some cities are so desperate for the cash and recognition that accompany GDP growth that they have literally moved mountains in order to create higher-value marketable land. “Powering the New China” (Chapter 8) explains the monumental task of providing electricity to one billion urban dwellers. Though China is poised to become a leader in alternative energy for decades to come, it has an insatiable demand that dictates a long-term reliance on dirty coal power as well. By 2030, the country will have installed over 2,500 gigawatts of annual electricity supply production - an installed base that is approximately two-and-a-half times that of the United States. The first time I read about Chinese “ghost cities” was in the seminal Time photo essay where this photo comes from, about Ordos’ new Kangbashi district in Inner Mongolia, which ironically is where Bitmain would later set up huge bitcoin mines. Other chapters describe in detail the nature of the “ghost city” appellation so eagerly employed by Western media outlets like 60 Minutes, Business Insider, and Time. In fact, Shepard successfully argues that the term “ghost city” itself is a misnomer. With connotations inherited from America’s old Wild West, it implies the depopulation of a formerly thriving center of commerce. When you say “ghost city” in America, thoughts turn to old mining towns, abandoned Catskills mountaintop resorts, and strip hotels along Route 66. But the character of “ghost cities” in China is exactly the opposite. As you can see in the Time photo essay, a Chinese “ghost city” is not an ancient relic, but rather a modern dream that represents the hope of things to come. In this sense, the Western media offers a criticism that is woefully misplaced. Zhengdong New District in Zhengzhou, Nanhui in Shanghai, Tianjin’s Ecocity, and the previously mentioned deserted desert district Ordos Kangbashi have all seen millions of people inhabit these areas after their embarrassing “ghost city” exposure. If you pause to think about it for just a second, that is the way it should work. These cities are built in anticipation of a flood of new residents. They are not going to reach capacity in a year. They probably will not even reach capacity in a decade. In a country where only one-fifth of its 1.4 billion people lived in cities at the beginning of Deng Xiaoping’s grand hybrid capitalist experiment and which has literally only just reached the halfway point in its goal of having one billion urban citizens by 2050, how else is this process going to work? This Field of Dreams “build it and they will come” philosophy is absolutely necessary. It may look awfully strange to Western observers, but those G20 citizens just do not live in a country that has to manage 1.4 billion people. The Party perceives Chinese urbanization as a priority for a variety of reasons. The primary reason is quite simple. Urban dwellers consume more. Thus, they contribute significantly more to GDP in the long run than self-sufficient farmers. In the short run, permanent construction offers a temporary super boost to GDP. Shepard lists a variety of other reasons as well. Another reason perhaps is to limit the chance of rural revolt by reversing the Mao maxim “the countryside surrounds the city.” In future China, it is clear that “the city surrounds the countryside” (90). Thus, for ambitious Party leaders, rapid urban development is a good way to earn a promotion. This immutable aspect of human nature - the desire to succeed in one’s individual career - explains a lot about the nature of China’s local debt problem. Indeed, various sources cite Chinese net debt (not only from government sources but also from private companies as well) as more than $36 trillion. The success of temporary city leaders increasingly relies on the undertaking of grandiose projects like the creation of endless central business districts, shopping malls, and Western-style suburbs. These projects require extensive financing, forcing cities to become ever more dependent on land sales for income to service these massive debts. But Shepard points out what should be obvious to Western China doomsayers like Gordon Chang, who wrote The Coming Collapse of China… in 2001! Party-operated locales mostly owe debt to Party-operated financial institutions. These same banks and funds have consistently shown a willingness to restructure this debt to accommodate the successful realization of government goals. Not all of these new infrastructure investments are sunk cost leviathans. They do earn money. For example, the current Prime Minister Li Keqiang initiated a $25.8 billion investment in Zhengzhou’s Zhengdong New District in 2003 (48). However, in a scant ten years later, its economy was growing at a healthy clip - around 13% - and already returning $1.22 billion in annual tax revenues to Beijing (55). For economists like myself who prefer to take the long-term view, that’s a pretty healthy return on investment! Aside from Shenzhen and Shanghai’s Pudong District, the classic examples of Chinese development success, this book provides many examples of flourishing urban planning. These type of projects will probably earn fine returns in first-tier cities, in what is called BeiShangGuang (meaning Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong province supercities Guangzhou and Shenzhen). But realizing acceptable rates of return on investments in third-tier cities and below is looking increasingly questionable. The only aspect of this book that I found fault with was the author’s claim that the Chinese “housing market is readjusting and topping out” (204). In 2016, Chinese real estate prices increased an average of 19% nationwide. In 2018, we are at even higher price levels in first-tier cities, but have started to see significant price declines in less desirable parts of the country. So my main criticism of Ghost Cities may well yet be proven unfounded. But even if real estate prices remain elevated, that does not disprove the main thesis of Shepard’s outstanding book. With just a little patience, most but probably not all of China’s “ghost cities” will likely be accretive to GDP and contribute to the “grand strategy” of Chinese leadership. Sadly, the West often lacks these qualities - the ability to think in decades instead of quarters, the ability to execute and complete large-scale projects - when it comes to finance and economics. Yeah, it looks like China may soon face its first significant economic correction since kaifang but this is merely representative of the cyclical nature of capitalism and should not merit a full-throated condemnation of leadership. At least, that’s what I thought at the beginning of 2017 and what I still believe to be true, in the long run at least, here at the end of 2018. A little “boots on the ground” perspective goes a long way.

They traffic in the hopes and dreams of the lower middle class aspirational Chinese citizen. Think of them as worse Asian versions of Tony Robbins. Well, I can’t afford to pay these guys the more than 200,000 CNY that they command from the laobaixing (老百姓) for them to be my mentor. So I’ve taken the habit of tracking down my own mentors in life. I will be presenting my studies of those characters periodically here on my blog. I call it: CASES IN SUCCESSThe first virtual mentor I will present is a guy most everyone will know through his company - Amazon, one of two companies to have commanded a $1 trillion valuation at some point. More interestingly, at least to me, is the fact that after the Dot Com Bubble in 2000, AMZN shares traded down more than 90% after reaching a high of more than $100 during one of investment’s great speculative bubbles. At that time, many businessmen would have been disappointed and closed down shop. But the founder and CEO of Amazon persisted. This year his stock has seen a record high of more than $2050 and currently trades at $1663. Are you reading this out there, Crypto World? The lesson here is simple. Keep thinking. Keep building.Don’t worry about the price the market accords to your company. Worry about the value YOU and YOUR EMPLOYEES bring to your company. In the long run, the latter is what’s important. Never the former. And now without further ado, the story of Jeff Bezos. In 527 words. Come on! We’re trying to learn the habits of success here. Not write a biography! Jeff Bezos is an Internet pioneer. He founded Amazon, a technology-driven e-commerce website. In the 2016 version of the Forbes 400 ranking of top billionaires, he was the second wealthiest American. Microsoft’s Bill Gates is the only American more wealthy than Mr. Bezos. This retailer early on established a goal to be “the world’s most customer-centric company.” To that end, Amazon has been wildly successful. He graduated summa cum laude from Princeton in 1986. Afterwards, Bezos held a variety of roles on Wall Street. His first jobs were as an engineer and computer scientist. In 1994, he read a statistic stating that Web usage was growing at an annual rate of 2300 percent. The “gold rush” of the Internet’s early days called to him. He promptly quit his respected job at a quantitative hedge fund. He then drove across the country to begin his life as a Seattle entrepreneur. He wrote the business plan en route. He based his decision to begin his startup on a “regret minimization framework.” He asked himself a set of two simple questions. Would he regret having tried and failed? No. Would he regret having not tried? Always. Therefore, Amazon.com was born. This iconic picture is lifted from a 60 Minutes piece done on Amazon in 1999. Amazon started at the dawn of the Dot-Com Boom era (1995-2000). After moving his family out West, Bezos spent a year preparing to launch his company. He opened a small office, recruited talent, and established vendor relationships. Mostly, however, he spent a year working on complex software infrastructure. Amazon.com launched in July 1995. The company was started with $300,000 of seed capital from his parents (almost their entire life savings) and then later $1 million from 20 angel investors. Initially, the online platform focused exclusively on books. Why books? Bezos believed that books were the “first best” products to use in an e-commerce business. They were flat and easy to ship. The category also offers a diverse array of similar products. These characteristics are perfectly suited to the sophisticated management only available through a computer database. There are millions of books in print at any given time. It is impossible for a bricks-and-mortar retail bookstore to offer all of these titles at once. Amazon can at least come close to this ideal. In the first 30 days of its existence, Amazon received orders from all 50 states and 45 countries. Having started with a distribution center the size of a one-car garage, the company was obviously unprepared for this rush of orders. It quickly moved to a two thousand square foot concrete warehouse. It has been cramped for space ever since. Today, Bezos’ $370 billion company is the largest retailer in the world. How can we aspire to be as successful as Mr. Bezos? First, you should “make sure you are focused on something you are passionate about.” Another important factor is your perspective on risk. Because “risk is a necessary component of progress,” a company must “use its precious startup funds to systematically eliminate risk.” Lastly, experimentation is key. You have to keep trying until you find the right mix of strategic elements that wholly satisfy your customers.

It has gotten to the point where the very concept of utility tokens has come under fire. Many pundits now claim that the utility token is dead and will never rise again. My favorite new crypto jargon these days is futility token. However, correlation is not always causation. Utility tokens did not cause the collapse of the crypto markets this year. Insider trading, outright scams, the lack of proper risk management, the inevitable unwinding of a hype cycle, the Tether hypothesis, the impact of bitcoin futures, and more… All of these reasons are more obvious and more direct causes of the approximate 90% collapse in prices across the board for all cryptographic assets seen in 2018. Increasingly, however, especially within the context of the stock market’s recent Santa Claus Folly, I’m leaning more and more towards the “canary in a coal mine” scenario. If that is indeed the case, then there was nothing any one blockchain person or entity could have done to avoid it. Let’s not blame the messenger though. In this environment, that’s all the poor little utility token was - a fleet-footed Pheidippides warning us all to take off our rose-colored glasses and start to clean house before digital tokenized assets on the blockchain become a legitimate asset class warranting a significant part in investor portfolios all over the world. And if you buy into the “canary” argument, you’d have to thank bitcoin for warning us all to get our financial asset portfolio “ducks in a row” before the shit truly hit the fan. But let’s be very clear about the distinction between utility tokens and security tokens going forward. Security tokens are great, but by no means are they revolutionary. Utility tokens, on the other hand, still have the capacity to reshape the digital world we live in for the better of all mankind. Security tokens, in what will most likely be their most prevalent use case, are basically just digital stock certificates. Cool and useful? Yes. Revolutionary? No. I don’t know. You tell me. But I’m thinking that might be an opinion that is a little bit out of tune with the rest of the industry these days. So please allow me to explain. Why Are Utility Tokens Still So Important?Utility tokens offer the hope of redefining the way ownership of a network works forever. In today’s equity-based environment, the gains due to the private ownership of a successful closed network or platform business accrue solely to the equity holders. Users are subject to monopoly pricing power and at-times authoritarian regulation. Closed network ecosystems do not maximize economic value.Closed network ecosystems almost always allow too much power to accumulate to one participant, eventually that will be to a single node in the network. There are users and there are owners and never the twain shall meet. A user may use that platform in order to transact as either a platform buyer or a platform seller. But in either case, they are a platform user that endeavors to exploit said platform for their own economic benefit by engaging in economic activity, the profit from which mostly accrues to the platform owner, though there may be just enough of a “taste” provided to the user to keep them engaged. This type of closed system incentivizes the platform users to engage solely in pure profit-seeking behavior. However, in game theoretical terms, because platform owners must also make this base assumption, they must also engage in profit-seeking behavior, the result of which, in the long run, hampers the growth of network activity. In short, the economic incentives are not the same for a platform user as they are for a platform owner. This inequity results in massive economic inefficiency. Thus, closed network ecosystems do not maximize economic value, but they can maximize it for the one player in the ecosystem that may achieve monopoly status. At the very least, growth is sacrificed for control. Perhaps the most famous example of a monopoly owner of a closed network system is the famous Browser Wars of 1995 to 2001. In this case, Microsoft exerted its control over the ecosystem to the detriment of the ecosystem’s growth but to the benefit of the monopoly owner, Microsoft. In this lockdown dragout battle from the Internet Bubble era, the open-source browser software Netscape Navigator held an IPO, almost immediately tripling its valuation to $2 billion. But the company still lacked the cash reserves and OS domination of rival Microsoft. Thus, when Microsoft introduced a browser of its own, the even-to-this-very-day notoriously flawed Internet Explorer, Netscape despite having a superior product of its own, eventually could not compete against its pre-installed and freely distributed browser competitor. Why? Microsoft operated its own closed network ecosystem, the Windows operating system (OS). That OS commanded more than 90% of the pre-install market for newly manufactured computers. Basically, they controlled what software got bundled onto PCs without actually having to produce those new machines themselves. As you would expect, the margins were redonkulous. However, this practice would quickly land Bill Gates’ company in hot water with the Department of Justice and a protracted five-year-long battle with superlawyer David Boies in one of the most famous anti-trust cases in the history of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890. Source/Course_materials/Overview/Web_Browsers) The result was a relatively swift kill by IE over Navigator. The monopolistic interest had no interest in letting a valuable business (the internet browser) camping out and flourishing in its pre-existing monopoly ecosystem (the Windows operating system). We see these kinds of epic struggles over market share every once in a while in our technology cycle-driven lives. The last one I remember clearly was the argument surrounding the struggle between China, a country that basically owns its telecommunications industry via a triumvirate of nationalized behemoths, and Tencent, a fast-growing Chinese tech firm that plays by the Party rules in order to safeguard its status as “national champion” of IT and all that is not e-commerce in the Chinese Web 2.0. Back in 2011, when its now flagship app WeChat had just been launched, it siphoned off a key piece of revenue for the closed network operators of China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom. They had been used to billions of dollars in annual revenue from SMS fees. Yes, that arcane practice of charging per text (or even per character!) to people who want to communicate with one another. But WeChat was about to end that game with its over-the-top (OTT) network services. When WeChat first came on the scene, the Chinese government’s telecom triopoly tried to force Tencent to pay compensation for this displacement of revenue. In the end, the effort stalled and the Chinese telecom industry vowed to reorganize as a more efficient pseduo-monopoly, realizing that the 4G, and soon to be 5G, closed networks that they operated would serve as the backbone for all future tech innovation in China. If those Chinese telecoms were not state-owned enterprises (SOE), and thus willing to operate within the bounds of what’s best for the country’s economy (at least some of the time) rather than what’s best for their company, rest assured that they would not have given up such a battle so quietly. See AT&amp;T, its forced breakup, and eventual reassembly for an example of how a more purely capitalist enterprise would have responded. An example of how capitalist monopolies in control of closed network systems work to deter innovation that Western readers might be more familiar with is the classic story of Zynga versus Facebook. With its flagship game Farmville, this online gaming startup took advantage of an API Facebook initially released in May 2007. Ironically, the API had initially been a part of Mark Zuckerberg’s kill move on Myspace. Hey, I just went to check and see if Myspace still had a website and, yep, it does! Isn’t that amazing? After Zynga growth hacked its way to something like 100 million DAUs (daily active users), Facebook aggressively moved to cut off the fuel that fed Zynga’s growth after negotiations broke down after the implementation of Facebook Credits. Eventually, however, Facebook would reduce the amount of insidious messages on its platform by 95%, in the name of fighting spam, but it could just as well be characterized as starving Zynga of potential new users. The software company with the cute bulldog logo almost starved to death. With a post-IPO peak valuation of nearly $13 billion in 2012, Zynga (ZNGA) trades today at a little less than $3.5 billion, which is still about double the value it fetched at its all-time low back in early 2016. Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) traded at its all-time low in 2012, at around a $50 billion market capitalization. Earlier this year, in 2018, FB traded at an all-time high of over $600 billion. I’ll just leave those numbers right here again. ZNGA - $3 B; FB - $600 B. I can’t think of a better argument than that for opting to support the development of open network economies. Just think of how much better we could have made Farmville if only Facebook would have let us innovate! Well, I realize that my last sentence might not exactly persuade you of my argument, but i hope you get my meaning. The stories of Microsoft &amp; Netscape, Facebook &amp; Zynga, as well as the anti-story of China Mobile &amp; WeChat all illustrate why closed network economic systems are so dangerous. And why the growth of open-architecture network systems, driven by utility token adoption, is so god damn important. In contrast to the easily exploitable “walled garden” approach to network economics, a well-designed and well-operated open utility token economy creates a third class of economic actor, a user-owner if you will, to add to the previously mentioned classes of user and owner. In theory, such a user-owner would engage in economic behavior that would emphasize long term returns over short term. Introducing this economic actor into an economic system should help to balance the inherently short-term nature of the user/owner dialectic. In other words, giving early adopters some “skin in the game” while simultaneously diluting the power of the capitalist technocrats (“You gotta have someone to pay for it and someone to build it!”) at the heart of any network economy may in fact be the key to solving a whole host of technological issues related to cybersecurity, efficiency, and asset monetization. The friction between owner and user that is everpresent in a closed network economy just isn’t there in an open network economic ecosystem. In addition to injecting into the system an increasing amount of hybrid economic actors with stabilizing long-term economic time horizons, open token networks remove this friction by aligning all network participants to work together toward two common goals: the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. Most importantly, they offer society the best chance to resist the over accumulation, or centralization, of power at any one particular node in an emerging economic ecosystem. So please don’t pooh-pooh on utility tokens (UT) any more than you have to. They are not the problem. Assuredly, there are going to be some UTs that will emerge from this crypto winter that become very, very valuable. Other UTs will, inevitably, die. But they won’t have died because the concept of the utility token is inherently flawed. They will have died because the design of their particular utility token was flawed. In the end, UTs may only represent future access to a company’s networked product or network service (not equity). But given that 70% of tech value is driven by network effects, that could easily become a very valuable access token in the long run. UTs are not designed as investments and they should never have been even confused with securities. They are simply the fuel to engage in transactions on a specific network. Therefore, they should be exempt from securities laws. Though, in effect, they are a form of regulation upon their respective networks in and of themselves, should governments believe that UTs still deserve regulation, they could work towards a body of legislation specific to the nuances of utility tokens and not try to shoehorn them into existing regulatory policy. But these things take time, of course. In short, security tokens (STs) are great, but they aren’t the bee’s knees like utility tokens have the potential to be. STs may represent equity in a company or some other asset and offer many substantial benefits to tokenholders. There are a lot of reasons to like them (which I will reserve for another post). But let’s make this clear: Security tokens are not revolutionary. Utility tokens are.

As always when one is confronted by extended time in two so vastly different cultures, you start drawing up a list of contrasts and comparisons. Of course, the biggest one that my family and I noticed was, to put it simply, the sky. In the US, every single day that it didn’t rain left you with this perfect blue sky. Pale, almost white near the horizon proceeding via some algorithmically perfect Gaussian blur through baby boy blue and into this dark, almost midnight, blue in the sky directly above you. In more than 7 years spent in China, I have probably only seen this color sky a handful of times. My family and I know this. Expats know this. Well-travelled Chinese know this. Despite being hyper aware of this contrast, it still gets me every time. Unobscured by smog and pollution, The sky… is… breathtakingly beautiful. It’s just like that all the time, apparently. We may have just been caught in an unfortunate comparison of timing. Shanghai has been relentlessly gray, cold, and rainy for most of the past 2 months. Apparently, the weather in the American South, where I’m from, turned beautiful the day we arrived and began to turn cold the day of our departure. Sometimes you’re just lucky like that. But I’ve been back to Stateside three times in the past 2 years and this insight is my #1 takeaway. And like I said, this is despite the fact that I know, am aware, and expect there to be this difference. This, to me, makes this realization all the more amazing. I definitely don’t remember having this impression as a kid growing up. The blue of the sky was just what blue was to me then. These days my two-year-old drives home the contrast. For the first week we were in America, every time we walked outside she enthusiastically exclaimed, “Niao, niao, niao!” whenever she saw a bird, and “Laoshu, shu, shu,” every time she saw a squirrel. (Yeah, I know laoshu means “rat” but, really, a squirrel is just a rat with a bushy tail, so my kid isn’t exactly wrong. ) It’s almost like she had never seen them before. In Shanghai, we just don’t have those things. Or they’re so rare that seeing them be so common in another place is just like a revelation to a kid. Don’t get me wrong. We love Shanghai. We love China. But you can’t help what your (and your child’s) natural reactions are. And among the many obvious cultural and natural differences between the US and China, this response to the relative environmental conditions of each place is by far the biggest difference we see. To highlight that contrast, here is what it looks like outside my window today: The only blue we’re likely to see this winter in Shanghai will be the blue we see in the undies our neighbors hang out to dry on the clothesline.

Bogle","text":"Anyone who has invested in the stock market in the past 43 years owes a debt of gratitude to John C. Bogle, the recently departed founder of The Vanguard Group. Without him, retail investors might very well still be paying hundreds of dollars in commissions to buy individual stocks. Professional fund management would most likely be out of reach for all but the wealthiest investors. As it is, fintech startups like Robinhood and Vanguard competitors like Fidelity have been forced to lead the industry even further down the road toward zero fee management. That’s because Vanguard now has $5 trillion of assets under management (AUM), which puts a lot of pressure on their fund industry counterparts to reduce fees in an attempt to retain (and try to increase) their own AUM. How did Bogle start an asset management revolution?As a professor and long-time academic myself, I am very proud to relate that Bogle’s empire was founded upon a well-researched and distinguised undergraduate research paper. Yes, students, those assignments we give you that you think we don’t even read can indeed lead to big opportunities! Back in 1951, pretty much at the dawn of the mutual fund industry, Bogle’s basic premise was that, in the long run, active investment managers do not beat the benchmark that they are given by which to measure their investing success. He reasoned that investors would therefore be better off investing in a broad basket of stocks that replicated the returns of the stock market overall. He was right. Today, the exact number is certainly debated, but most people agree that between 80% and 98% of active fund managers fail to beat the market rate of return over the long term. What’s amazing is how he intuited that truth as a 21-year-old in an age without Big Data and massive computer processing power. Today, it’s easy to pull up some returns data on a Bloomberg terminal and quickly build an investment thesis backed by all sorts of fancy graphs and pie charts. But to do that in the environment of 67 years ago is absolutely incredible. And it got him a job at the up-and-coming (and still going strong) Wellington Fund upon his graduation. What does Bogle’s philosophy mean to today’s investors?As I tell my students when I talk about Mr. Bogle, the most important takeaway IMHO from Bogle’s career is encapsulated in the following quote: The most fundamental decision of investing is asset allocation.How much should you own in stock?How much should you own in bonds?How much should you own in cash reserves? . . .That decision [has been shown to account] for an astonishing 94% of the differences in total returns achieved by institutionally managed pension funds. . . .There is no reason to believe that the same relationship does not also hold true for individual investors. Ninety-four percent. All based on just one simple investment decision. So keep it simple. And maybe you too one day can manage FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS.

Plus, it’s like a week-plus of speaking straight Chinese 24/7, so you know my second language is gonna be baller when I get back to the grind. That’s always a plus.

It goes on like that for 6-7 days. Every day a new relative’s house to visit. Every day some sort of delicious pig soup and plates and plates of jiaozi.

Actually, the link above is not even about JP Morgan &amp; Chase Co’s obsession with creating a digital asset on the blockchain to mimic the usefulness of bitcoin. I just found that picture on this old Steemit post from last year by @mardah.resonance and I figured I’d save old @ned the server cost and reuse this fine graphic. For the record, I just find it more than a wee bit funny that the old “Bulge Bracket” bank has been desperately trying (and failing) to make something “bitcoin-y” for a long, long time. Not only that, but check this out! Apparently, this is not the first time we’ve had a “JPM Coin” in the cryptocurrency industry. Some Chinese scammers used this exact name brand back in 2015 to try and rope some unsuspecting retail investors (in China, they call them “leeks”) in to what was basically an MLM scheme. It got so bad that the China division of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. had to issue a statement on Oct. 30, 2015. 摩根大通获悉，一些网站、微博以及微信平台正在推广销售摩根币(JPM Coin)。这些网站、微博和微信平台均与摩根大通及其集团公司无关。摩根大通及其在华或全球的任何关联机构均未发售该名为“摩根币 (JPM Coin)”的产品。摩根大通并未授权任何此类或其它类似的虚拟货币，也未授权以任何方式提及JPMorgan,摩根大通，摩根等。 Here is the English translation: “JPMorgan Chase learned that some websites, Weibo Corporation and WeChat platforms are promoting the sale of JPM Coin. These websites, Weibo and WeChat platforms are not related to JP Morgan Chase and its group companies. JPM Coin and its affiliates in China or around the world have not sold the product called JPM Coin. JPMorgan does not authorize any such or other similar virtual currency, nor does it authorize any reference to JPMorgan, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan, etc.” Which all leads me to ask the question, So, when issuing its first bitcoin-like cryptoasset, out of all the potential names one could pick, why would JP Morgan Chase use the exact same branding as the 2015 scammers? 樂 Inquiring minds want to know.

If you don’t know who he is, check out this clip. To put it simply, he is going to be a star in the NBA. A megastar. He is 6 feet 8 inches or so tall, 280 pounds depending on how much he has recently eaten at the Blue Devil Tower. You aren’t that big and, at the same time, that athletic without working towards that goal for quite a while, which is why I wanted to highlight what Zion has posted on the top of his Twitter even today. Zion Williamson declared for Duke on January 20, 2018 but he pinned this Tweet on the top of his Twitter account more than 18 months prior to that. And it is still posted there today. Even though, as the 44th president of the United States, Barack Obama, pointed out the other night when Zion’s standard-issue (for all Duke players) Nike’s exploded causing a potentially college career-ending injury on literally the first play of the game against uber-rival the University of North Carolina Tar Heels, “His shoe broke!”I’m sure this setback will be just another hurdle to climb in what I hope will be a long and illustrious career for the Iron Lion Zion. He certainly has the right mentality to overcome anything set in his path. Long-term goal setting and a consistent work ethic are hallmarks of success. Zion’s pinned tweet proves it. So I think this won’t stop Zion Williamson from cashing in on all of his hard work as the consensus first pick in the 2019 NBA Draft.

I'm For It!","text":"Pretty much the entire blockchain industry lit up today all atwitter about the “highest yielding deposit account in finance” from BlockFi. Even Forbes got in on the lovefest. I can’t tell you how many WeChat messages I got and tweets came through my feed today saying basically the same thing. “Did you see what BlockFi is doing with 6.2% interest? Love that.” “Hey, did you hear you can get 6+% interest on your crypto in crypto?” “What is this about a bitcoin savings account? DAYUM.” Initially, I was like, “Meh, sounds good, I guess. I’ll check it out in a bit.” And then I did! And take a looky here: That’s a real, live website. I honestly think I’ll be sending my Coinbase stash over to BlockFi this weekend. Custody is by Gemini, the exchange started by those annoying twins portrayed in The Social Network. I’m sure they’re not like that in real life. But Gemini is a pretty stand-up name in the cryptosphere and backers of one of the better stablecoins out there - GUSD. So it makes sense, right? Deep down, I’m just a blind HODLer, right? I thought so, but then I read an old Chicago trader’s post about the news where he trotted out the old “High yield means high risk” line… to which you would think most blockchain enthusiasts would scream back at him saying DUH! IT’S CRYPTO! To my surprise, however, everyone agreed with him. Social media is so weird like that. So, here’s what I say. Look, the yield is 6.2% APY in bitcoin or ethereum, not cash. So you’re still making a bet on cryptocurrency. This we know. Most people on Steemit or with enough BTC or ETH to consider locking it up for the long-term are not gonna bat an eye at the potential bone-crushing volatility in cash returns on these things. They just want to increase their STACKZ. I like it. What’s the big deal? I’ll give my kid 1 BTC in that account and forget about it. By the time she goes to college, she’ll either have 2 BTC worth a bunch of USD, and I mean like maybe enough to pay for her whole collegiate adventure and still have some satoshis left over to go travelling a bit, or she’ll have 2 BTC worth nothing.

My initial reaction was basically RUFKM? Some images in this post, including the one above, come from this Bitcoin.com article, which does a good job summarizing the negative view on transaction mining. Some people call it trans-fee mining. After a bit of thinking, I started talking about it with our team. Our company Slack at Konstellation was peppered with questions like: So you mean tokenholders get paid for trading? Uh, how does the exchange make any money? How does this free token you get for trading retain any value? Are you sure that’s even legal? To say the least, we were skeptical, as were many in the blockchain industry. But, as with a lot of new and unfamiliar ideas we’ve encountered on our interstellar journey across the cryptoverse (Hey man, my company is named Konstellation, so I get to be liberal with the star-related puns!), engaging with this community and the game-changing technology of blockchain, you have to be willing to change your tune. That doesn’t mean that I think every exchange that uses transaction mining is doing it in a legit fashion. It just means that I don’t think transaction mining is as bad as I thought it was when I first encountered it. The world and its financial ecosystem are changing so fast that new paradigms become old ones and old frameworks get rendered obsolete, all in the blink of an eye. Fcoin began the transaction mining movement in June 2018. It was a major disruption for the crypto markets. As such, the existing crypto market institutions derided it primarily because it was a threat to newly established crypto players, which had themselves displaced previous exchange powerhouses like Bobby Lee’s BTCC. I don’t know who owns BTCC any more but I know good ol’ Bobby is long gone. Whoever owns BTCC now can’t even spell. Nice plateform, guys! At its height, Fcoin saw $17 billion of trading volume in one day. That’s what happens when people not only can trade for free, but get paid for doing it, too! Innovation is almost universally met with resistance. Moreover, it is the first movers that often get tossed aside once the new business model has been refined and accepted by the masses. Does anyone still use Friendster or Myspace? It turned out that the token economy of Fcoin was an extremely poor design. There was absolutely no incentive for holding the native FT token on the Fcoin exchange. The result was disaster for anyone who decided to hold the FT tokens they had acquired for free. Other exchanges that quickly adopted this model were Bitforex, Coinbene, Coinsuper, and Bgogo. Boy, just clicking through those links you’ll notice one overarching theme. These Chainup guys must be rich! Since most modern crypto-to-crypto exchanges originate from the same white label exchange service provider, the only distinguishing characteristic that differentiates these products is the token economics behind the native exchange token on each of these “3rd generation” exchanges. As somewhat of a regulatory nerd myself, I eventually came to realize that the true innovation in transaction mining is that it allows for the wide distribution of tokens without passing the Howey test. What is the Howey test? Despite what you may have heard, it is the ONLY method by which regulators can determine whether or not an “investment contract” is indeed a security. The test is derived from Supreme Court case law and was issued in the landmark case SEC v. Howey Co. on May 27, 1946. It still is the main determinant of what is and is not a security in the United States today. The so-called “test” looks at four factors. These four aspects must ALL be met in order for an asset to be considered a security according to US law: An investment of money… in a common enterprise… with an expectation of profits… to come solely from the efforts of others. The case goes on to state that “if that test be satisfied, it is immaterial whether the enterprise is speculative or nonspeculative, or whether there is a sale of property with or without intrinsic value.” Once one properly understands the parameters of the Howey Test, one can see the beauty of the trans-fee mining model. While the first 3 conditions of the Howey model are easily satisfied, the 4th condition is avoided when token holders must ACTIVELY do something to acquire the token. In this instance, for crypto exchanges at least, tokens are acquired via trading, thereby ensuring that native exchange tokens (from exchanges that utilize this business model) can never pass the Howey Test. Therefore, such tokens can never be considered a security. The first exchange to really advance this thinking in token economic design is Bitmax. They have employed what I call the “kitchen sink approach” to token economics. Not only do they use transaction mining on select pairs, right now it is only offered on two stablecoin pairs, they also have developed a unique “reverse mining” approach for all other pairs. This innovation means that they don’t have to dilute the BTMX native token by compensating traders with it on every trade. They just return the trading fee to you in a main coin like ETH and deduct the equivalent from your BTMX balance. This combination creates a two-way trade for BTMX tokens, rather than the one-way down down down that plagued FT tokens on Fcoin. In addition to these two methods of “mining” BTMX, Bitmax offers a ridiculously high “dividend” for those token holders that lock their BTMX up on the trading platform. Note the air quotes around “dividend” please. Because Ariel and George, the finance industry veterans who founded Bitmax, are not stupid enough to actually call it that. Instead they use the term “Data Usage Reward.” By ACTIVELY allowing them to use your trading data (for what, no one knows) they avoid the designation of security according to the Howey Test. It’s a smart way to go about it. There is, however, one flaw in their model. And it is this flaw that makes me certain that we have not seen the end of “liquidity innovation” on crypto-to-crypto exchanges. For the longest time, the “data usage reward” had been unreasonably high. The annual percentage rate (APR) given to BTMX token holders that locked up their tokens on the platform was between 70% and 100%. In order to bring this number down to more reasonable levels, the BTMX token price had to be pumped. Remember, as price increases, yield decreases. As of today, the APR is now a much more reasonable 33.3667%. However, in order to achieve this much more reasonable yield, they now have to have 3-4x more volume on the two stablecoin pairs (USDC/USDT and PAX/USDT) in which you can conduct trans-fee mining. That is just what has to happen in order for the exchange to maintain the previous pre-pump inflation rate of the BTMX token supply. This inevitable truth leads to some pretty ridiculous looking charts: Remember that is a stablecoin pair you are looking at! $1=$1, right? Not on Bitmax. So this token design has led to some rather unbelievable volume numbers since the initial pump in BTMX price. Let’s take a look at today’s top 10 exchanges according to reported volume on CMC: So Bitmax ends up being the #1 exchange according to reported volume, even though it is the #49 exchange when it comes to adjusted volume. That’s because 99.32% of their volume is recorded in the two stablecoin pairs that allow transaction mining of the BTMX token. I don’t know about you but I find it extremely unlikely that there is $7.29 billion worth of capital out there willing to chase bips on the limited volatility in stablecoin pairs on an exchange most people have never heard of. Nevertheless, I can’t wait to see what the next iteration of the trans-fee mining model will bring. Transaction mining is a good idea that has yet to come into full flower.

But let’s take a look at the bigger picture here. One of the more interesting projects in Crypto Land these days, in my opinion, is what Overstock (OSTK) is doing to transform its business. Its founder and CEO Patrick Byrne has always been an interesting character who speaks his mind. In my own business dealings, I try to maintain truth and honesty at all costs, so I guess I’m a little predisposed to appreciate whatever Byrne is up to. As a Warren Buffett aficionado, I also respect the family pedigree. Patrick’s father was John J. Byrne, former longtime CEO of GEICO, White Mountains Insurance Group, and Fireman’s Fund (a former American Express subsidiary). All of these assets were important contributions to the huge success of Berkshire Hathaway shares in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. Son Patrick is in the midst of transforming his American e-commerce also-ran into a premier collection of blockchain-based companies under the Medici Ventures umbrella, a wholly-owned subsidiary of OSTK. Why is that a good strategy? As Jack Welch is probably most famous for saying (he’s famous for a lot of things I know), you need to collect assets that are either #1 or #2 in their respective industries. You can try for a while to vault yourself into that premier echelon, but if it becomes obvious you will not be able to get there, you need to sell that asset or get rid of it altogether. Some people have called this philosophy Jack Welch’s Burning Platform. In the beginning of the dot-com era, OSTK was competing more or less directly with Amazon (AMZN). These days, however, they’ve dropped back to at least #4 in the e-commerce arena. Amazon, as you probably know, is one of the most valuable companies in the world. Wal-mart, after years of missteps in this arena, has recently gone on a tear in the e-commerce space after acquiring Jet.com and 12% of Alibaba’s chief competitor, JD.com. Recently, loss leader Wayfair has maneuvered its way into third place. And then there is all the little guys enabled by e-tail infrastructure provider Shopify and crafts marketplace Etsy. In short, in the immortal words of the greatest guitar player of all time, They say two thousand zero zero party over, oops, out of time And that’s okay! Business is about the pivot. And certainly not about throwing good money after bad. As CEO Byrne said in the most recent earnings call, “I realized, it was a mistake to try to chase this competitor [Wayfair], and we had to revert to our DNA, which is focusing on value and running the company to profitability.” The plan going forward for OSTK seems to be quite Berkshire-y, to be honest. If Byrne can’t sell the the e-commerce platform for cash, then he can clearly use it as a cash-flow generator and deploy excess profits into the long-term value-generating machine that is Medici. It’s true Ben Graham style cigar butt investing at its finest. Only Byrne didn’t even have to acquire the e-commerce business for cheap. He built it from scratch! Everything happens for a reason.One of the reasons that OSTK fell so far behind AMZN in the post-dot com crash era was a long-running obsession with “naked” short-selling that definitely led them to keep their off the ball against such a formidable opponent as Jeff Bezos. That has led them to create one of the more intriguing blockchain products out there - the Digital Locate Receipt - which should enable exchanges to track the supply of actual shares available to trade and prevent people from shorting a stock without having any of the shares in their possession. This is where the term “naked” comes from. It’s all finance nerd stuff. But that’s what has lead Medici to create its crown jewel asset, Tzero, in a bid to fix all the myriad things that are wrong with our existing financial system. The name of the exchange is a play on how trades are settled today. Even despite digital technology that could record the transfer of ownership of any asset instantly, somehow regulators have allowed bourses to continue the practice of recording share transfer activity and then “settle” those trades 2 days later. For some reason, the industry standard is transaction plus two days (or T+2 as it is most often referred to) for settlement of trades. Given that we have AI bots making most trades on most exchanges in the world today, it absolutely makes no sense that this is how we do things today in the finance world. The second most interesting company in the Medici stable is Medici Land Governance (MLG). In a world where 2/3 of the world’s citizens are unbanked and live on property that is not properly deeded to them, you can start to understand just how massively important this project could be to lifting the world’s poor out of poverty. The basis for wealth for almost anybody derives from their ability to own properly deeded property. MLG creates bespoke technology stacks for governments to leapfrog into the 21st century world of land titling, administration, and tax revenue generation. Even my home county in the United States does not have this tech! If you want to create a deed chain today, you need to pay a lawyer to go down to the courthouse and research the history of that address for a day to tell you who owned what structures and where exactly they were built on a defined piece of land, from today all the way back to ever since the government split up that piece of property into an individual lot. It’s an expensive, handmade research process that is ripe for disruption. With that background taken care of, world citizens can far more easily access loans to expand a business, weather rough times, or make investments in their community. That’s why MLG has partnered with the World Bank to spread this technology to as many places as possible as quickly as possible. Byrne states in the conference call, “The World Bank is frankly taking us all over the world to make introductions for us to do projects. It’s really a matter of how quickly we can build the modules and spin them up.” Other interesting projects in the Medici portfolio are Bitt, which owns an mMoney wallet that is being integrated into the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, and Vinsent, which is connecting wine connoisseurs directly with wineries to ensure that high-end wines are not fake and properly distributed. And these are just 4 of the 20-plus blockchain ventures that Medici has directly invested in or started on their own from scratch. Tzero and MLG could easily become unicorns in the not-too-distant future. And if that happens, OSTK stock could be a multi-bagger just based off their potential alone. But what if overstock.com gets sold for more powder that can be plowed into the Medici portfolio? Then we are talking about BRK-style returns in the long run. Especially when you consider that, if overstock.com is sold, OSTK stock will be the only sufficiently large and liquid blockchain pure play that is currently trading on the stock market. If OSTK can pull off this transition from e-commerce also-ran to Blockchain Berkshire Hathaway, the potential gains for investors could be huge!If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading.

I remember thinking what a big deal it was when I decided to put 1% of my investment portfolio into BTC, ETH, and NEO (of all things! ). To me, that was a reasonable amount to invest, relatively, into magic internet money. I think, in the runup to the miraculous bull run of late 2017 and early 2018, I may have let myself get caught up in the frenzy enough that I contributed approximately 5% of my investment capital into cryptocurrency and then, through appreciation alone, that got up to about 15%. I took a little profit in early 2018 but, of course in retrospect, not enough. But that’s on me. I’m not blaming anyone for those “losses.” Because, really, they’re not actual losses. Just like they’re not gains until you sell, whatever I had on paper in January 2018, I really didn’t have in actual value. Who knows? If I had tried to sell NEO at $185 I might have crashed the market with my bag! I now know what caused me to miss out on those profits. And that had nothing to do with anything else but me. What caused me to do what in retrospect was so stupid? That’s easy. Greed.## ##To put it simply, I thought NEO was going to $300.

So it’s important to have established some rational guidelines you can harken back to BEFORE things get emotional. Probably the most important guidance for investors is easier said than done. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.## Because the chances are high when you do that that you are gonna break some eggs. Just like this. I mean that brilliant investment idea that you think no one else has and you are ready to go AWL EEN on? It just might work out. Or it might not. If you lose all your powder in one last showdown, you might go down in a blaze of glory, but you ain’t playing again. Not with that capital, at least. So maximize your chances while ensuring that you live to see another day. And play again. And yet, I still hear about people who put money into coins crying, “I lost millions.” Or in Chinese, “我的三百万变成20万。(My 3 million has become 200,000!) Well, that’s awful. But did you really do that without “millions” invested in other assets? That’s just crazy. I can’t imagine going all in on digital assets, literally, to where they were 100% of my investment portfolio. I mean maybe once we have security tokens and a reliable wallet to store them in… but we are far from that right now. Intuitively, I think most people understand that. But when emotions get involved, the picture is much cloudier. For instance, nearly everyone, including myself, falls prey to the great killer of investment alpha: the sunk cost fallacy. The sunk cost fallacy leads investors to throw good money after bad by doubling down on their worst investments, so that they can “more quickly get their money back.”##Yeah, somehow way back in the lizard part of your brain, it sounds good to lower your cost basis. I guess the thinking is that your investment, once it eventually goes back to your original buy-in price, will bring you that much more in return at that point. The problem is that IT MIGHT NEVER GO BACK TO THAT PRICE EVER AGAIN. The logic here is flawed. Instead of investing money in your best ideas at the moment, the ones which supposedly have the most potential to gain at that precise time, you invest in an idea simply because you have invested in it before. It is literally like saying, “The last time I ate this food it made me sick. So I will eat it again because maybe now I have built an immunity to it, and if not, maybe this time I eat it and get sick will get me that much closer to a time where eventually I can eat it and not got sick.” Yay! Greed, lack of portfolio diversification, and sunk cost fallacy are some of the reasons why most people fail to outperform even a basic stock index fund like SPY. But by far the worst investor trait that young investors use to try and CRUSH the markets, the most dangerous threat to your financial independence surely, is leverage. Leverage itself is neither good nor bad. It merely amplifies your investment decisions.## But that is why when you are young and inexperienced, on its face, borrowing money to make investments is a decidedly bad idea. Without investing experience, you are just amplifying your learning curve. That’s not very likely to be a winning formula. Most of the world’s best investors, like Warren Buffett or Bill Ackman, don’t really hit their stride until they are well into their 40s and 50s. Moreover, if you are using leverage, and if that money is coming from friends and family, and they do not agree to the sharing of the investment risk, it can destroy relationships. If that money is borrowed on your own behalf, and the investment does not perform according to your expectations, you could be hamstringing yourself for years, or even decades. So don’t do it! And yet, every time there is a bull run in some asset class, the same process is repeated. The smart money that has played this game over and over again throughout their lives come in and grab their 50% to 100%. Then calmly leave out the front door, leaving a mass of noob retail investors to fight over the last 20% to 30% scraps at the top. Firmly secure atop their pile of cash, waiting for the next bubble to appear in some other asset class at a later date, these guys watch as everything crashes around the retail investors, 60-70-80% losses in some unfortunate positions are the norm in such a situation. And if you committed one of the “capital” sins above anywhere near that bull market top… Well, God help you. The only thing left for you to do is pick yourself up and GET. THAT.

I looked at my Robinhood notifications and thought “No, that can’t be right. There’s no way Ethereum is $141…” Wait. WHAT?## Ethereum was $140. Bitcoin was $5000. “Oh, it must be some kind of FUD,” I thought. “I wonder if it’s China FUD or Tether FUD?” Well, as most of you already know, this time it was Tether FUD. This is a great pic from this article from one of the many times our old friend Tether Fudd has decided to pay us an unannounced visit. Stay calm. It’s not a big deal. This has happened before and will happen again. Sure, USDT is not the most straight-forward transparent stablecoin out there. And neither is the USD currency. Both USD and USDT derive their value from 3 sources: 1) their abundant supply, 2) their nearly universal acceptance (almost all crypto exchanges have USDT), and 3) their unparalleled dispersion throughout the world. And none of that is affected by a little FUD generated by the ruling of the financial regulator of a single state in Murica. In fact, one has to wonder what kind of sway a New York state regulator really has over Bitfinex and Tether, which are both owned and operated by iFinex Inc., a company which is headquartered in Hong Kong and registered in the British Virgin Islands. I’m pretty sure Americans are not allowed to trade on Bitfinex, so this all seems a lot a whole lot of sound and fury signifying nothing. That’s why crypto traders have learned to … ALWAYS BUY TETHER FUD #ABTF## Case in point: Quantfury, a startup platform that provides unmatched trading conditions for currently mostly crypto traders across all asset classes - think BitMEX and eToro crossed with Robinhood - has never had a day with more than $20 million in trading volume. You see, they don’t allow bot trading via APIs so it’s a great proxy for true trader sentiment in the cryptoverse. And today, which pretty much began with an opening salvo by Tether Fudd, the platform is seeing almost $27 million in volume today. That’s more than double their average daily volume for the past week and approximately 35% higher than their all-time trading volume high. Apparently the traders on their platform subscribe to ABTF as well. Another aspect to think about is that stablecoins are an industry unto themselves at this point. In this regard, I think Messari has it right. They have removed the stablecoins from their Coinmarketcap-style league table and placed them in their own Stablecoin Index. It’s kind of beautiful. Right now they only list 8 stablecoins with a combined market cap of $3.59 billion. From a supply perspective, USDT makes up about 80% of the supply. But from a trading perspective, USDT is involved in 96.3% of all stablecoin trades. That is quite a massive headstart in this emerging industry. Tether FUD is a way to give the TUSD, USDC, PAX, GUSD, and DAI’s of the world a chance to maybe pick up some of that market share. Does the fact that GUSD’s parent company Gemini is located in New York City matter? Maybe, maybe not. But I don’t think that fact can be ignored either. That leaves us with the simple maxim, #ABTF. One that we can repeat whenever we hear charges like this in the future. #ABTF. One that can comfort us whenever we wake up in the middle of the night and our Blockfolio screams red, red, red! #ABTF #ABTF #ABTF## Always Buy Tether FUD. Remember this and you’ll be fine.

He always tried to do what other people said was impossible. Sometimes he failed. But when he was right, his projects were spectacularly successful. Although he did not invent any of the products he is famous for, he was a visionary that inspired a technological and entertainment revolution. He was born to a young Syrian professor and his American graduate student girlfriend in 1955. Although they would later marry, they put their newborn son up for adoption. In what was the first of many rejections in his life, the first-choice adoptive parents at the last minute decided they wanted a girl. Jobs’ birth mother had demanded that the adoptive couple be educated and wealthy. But an uneducated Armenian couple who lived in the San Francisco suburbs adopted her unwanted son. That part of California would soon after become to be known as Silicon Valley. Steve’s biological mother made Paul and Clara Jobs promise that they would send him to college. They scrimped and saved for 17 years for tuition. As you would an expect from an idealist, Steve went to one of the most expensive schools in the United States. Young Jobs spent 6 months at Reed College before deciding that he “couldn’t see the value in it.” So one of the most successful men in modern history became a penniless dropout. However, he happily spent the next 18 months as a “drop-in.” He pursued all the classes he was interested in and none that were required. Only later would he be able to “connect the dots” of the importance of this pursuit. Jobs returned home to this modest house in Los Altos, California. It is now a protected historic site. He somehow convinced executives at Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Atari to give him part-time jobs. But at Atari, one of the first video game companies, he clashed with his coworkers. So they only let him work the night shift. He then invited his older friend Steve Wozniak to come and hang out in his garage. Wozniak met Jobs at HP. After three years of working in the Jobs family garage, they founded Apple Computer on April 1, 1976. It was Jobs’ idea. He was the entrepreneur. Wozniak was the engineer. In just four years, Apple had an initial public offering (IPO) that valued the company at 1.7 billion dollars. 300 millionaires, all early Apple employees, were created instantly. It was an “orderly” debut, as they say, while Steve rocked a similarly “orderly” mean mustache. Nice! But Jobs’ clashes with coworkers continued, even at the company he co-founded. Although he enjoyed the tenuous bond of shared childhood with Wozniak, he was stubborn, impolite, and obstinate with others. He drove his Macintosh team too hard. The Board of Directors fired him in 1985. Jobs later said, “Getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me… [It was] awful tasting medicine but I guess the patient needed it.” The medicine worked. Within the next year, he founded two billion-dollar companies. In his famous 2005 Stanford commencement speech, Jobs claimed it was one of the “most creative periods in my life.” NeXT was a computer company. In 1996, Apple paid $429 million to NeXT investors and gave 1.5 million shares of Apple stock to Jobs for his company. The NeXT operating system became the basis for Apple’s immensely successful OS X. That stock grant would have been worth tens of billions today. However, Jobs almost immediately sold the stock grant for just $22 million in 1997 because he “had given up hope that the Apple board was going to do anything.” He was still shellshocked from his first experience with corporate Apple and was riding high on his other company’s Toy Story success. “If that upsets employees, I’m perfectly happy to go home to Pixar,” he said at the time. Pixar Animation Studios was an even more successful startup for Jobs. Most of the Jobs family’s current wealth derives from his time at Pixar and not from his considerably longer time working for Apple. When Disney bought his company for $7.6 billion in 2006, Jobs took his share in Disney stock. He was granted 138 million shares. After Disney’s success buying Marvel and Lucasfilm, that stake became worth tens of billions of dollars. Later, Steve’s widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, would sell half the Disney stake to become a minority shareholder in the NBA’s Washington Wizards and NHL’s Washington Capitals, among other means of diversifying her portfolio. The NeXT acquisition helped reinstall Jobs as Apple CEO. At the time, Apple was almost bankrupt. But he somehow convinced his archrival and long-time nemesis Bill Gates to save his company with a $150 million investment. That investment is a whole nother story where Microsoft ends up missing out on $20+ billion. Jobs then went on the most successful run of product innovation in the history of mankind. He introduced the iMac in 1998, the iPod in 2001, the iPhone in 2007, and the iPad in 2010. Despite Steve Jobs’ premature death on October 5, 2011, Apple Inc. became the first company to achieve a trillion-dollar valuation.

The conversation usually begins with a question: “You know about Wu Yi?” Wu Yi literally means 5-1, the internationally recognized date for Labor Day, or as some countries call it: International Worker’s Day.## My response usually elicits wide eyes and a short intake of breath. “Why wouldn’t I know about Wu Yi? It is the only Chinese holiday that was invented by Americans.” “Whaaaat? You are waiguoren. You don’t know about China. When I was a kid, Wu Yi was a Golden Week just like the National Day Holiday or Spring Festival. It is an important Chineeese holiday. There is no way it can be from America!” I smile, say something about Mao Zedong being the intellectual descendent of the American socialist progressive movement, and launch into a paraphrased version of the Chicago Haymarket affair. The drawings that came from this incident are fantastic, I mean take a look at this one from the Chicago Historical Society. It is Game of Thrones’ “Battle of Winterfell”-worthy. Since I cannot tell the story much better than Wikipedia, here you go: The Haymarket affair (also known as the Haymarket massacre or Haymarket riot) was the aftermath of a bombing that took place at a labor demonstration on Tuesday May 4, 1886, at Haymarket Square in Chicago. It began as a peaceful rally in support of workers striking for an eight-hour day and in reaction to the killing of several workers the previous day by the police. An unknown person threw a dynamite bomb at police as they acted to disperse the public meeting. The bomb blast and ensuing gunfire resulted in the deaths of seven police officers and at least four civilians; scores of others were wounded. In the internationally publicized legal proceedings that followed, eight anarchists were convicted of conspiracy. The evidence was that one of the defendants may have built the bomb, but none of those on trial had thrown it. Seven were sentenced to death and one to a term of 15 years in prison. The death sentences of two of the defendants were commuted by Illinois governor Richard J. Oglesby to terms of life in prison, and another committed suicide in jail rather than face the gallows. The other four were hanged on November 11, 1887. In 1893, Illinois’ new governor John Peter Altgeld pardoned the remaining defendants and criticized the trial. Why May 1 then? In 1884, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions had held a convention setting May 1, 1886 as the day that the 8-hour workday would become a national standard. When that desire did not come to pass in a timely manner, strikes were staged throughout the country. Chicago was at the epicenter. “Eight-hour day! No cut in pay!”“Eight-hour day! No cut in pay!”##The strikes lasted for days and culminated in the Haymarket massacre. Socialist parties throughout the world vowed to commemorate the brave workers who had been executed as a result of the riot. In 1889, May 1 officially became Labor Day throughout the world. And it still is today. But not in America. In China. Hence, during this upcoming 4-day “weekend” in Shanghai, let us not forget to remember fondly those unswerving Americans who fought so gallantly to give us this great Chinese holiday. Thanks guys!

It’s called “The Rich Kid Revolutionaries” and it talks about the recent movement by the progeny of the affluent to rail against how the US “is rigged in favor of making the very wealthy even wealthier.” Besides the very obvious Clintonian retort one could posit against this sentiment, “It’s the economy, stupid!” In a capitalist system, the business of business is business, and all that Milton Friedman jazz… I just have to say… It’s about time we had some rich kids take responsibility for the society of wealth &amp; privilege in America that our forebears created. Now before I get flack for calling out poor unsuspecting trust fund kids, let me just say that I’m not saying that hard work shouldn’t be rewarded with the well-earned ability to take care of one’s family (even for a couple or three generations). We all aspire to that. It is the foundation of the Immigrant Dream that brought my grandfather to these shores back in the 1960s. But while most of us are doomed to spend the bulk of our careers paying off student loans and maybe, if we’re lucky, one measly mortgage… It’s nice to see that there are some rich kids, at organizations like Resource Generation out there that realize what they’ve got. Not only that, they are trying to do something positive to close America’s ever-widening rich-poor gap. According to The World Bank, the US ranks third on the GINI Index, behind only notoriously corrupt Brazil &amp; Mexico. By all means, play with the data here and please let me know what you find! It’s about time. The US recently passed China, whose rapidly ascendant middle class is quickly eroding what was one of the world’s worst rich-poor gaps.

No, I did not have helicopter parents that pushed me into doing something lucrative. No, I did not have rich relatives that helped me by exposing me to their well-placed contacts. No, I wasn’t a math whiz kid. I mean I definitely attended some math competitions in my day. But calculus… The struggle was real! There’s only so many times you can fling a big, heavy textbook across the room before you start thinking, “How much longer do I want to do THIS?” The story of how I got into finance is probably a lot more similar to the stories people from my generation like to tell when they give their reasons why they DON’T like finance. Despite our best efforts, it seems to me like we are all still living in the shadow of September 15, 2008. For those of you who forgot, were too young to care, or just plain don’t want to remember, here’s a little reminder: At that time, I had been running a small real estate investment operation. We hadn’t been doing well. Obviously. I was trying to flip houses in the middle of the subprime mortgage crisis. What was I thinking? Well, I certainly wasn’t thinking the way a well-trained “finance guy” is supposed to think. In a classic misunderstanding of how to achieve an appropriate level of diversification in one’s portfolio, in addition to my small real estate investment operation I had also invested in a few real estate investment trusts (REITs). Why not? After all, I was an “expert” at this real estate stuff, right? You should know how that story ended. Not well. At that point then and there, well not really at any particular point per se, but whenever the accumulation of financial loss caught up with the lizard part of my brain that just keeps on truckin’ — eating, drinking, and farting away — that lizard must have some thick skin because it seems like it took a while for things to get to that “point” — about as long maybe as I am taking to get to my point here — at whatever that point is then and there, I decided to seek out a world-class education in finance and investment theory. I am still learning finance today because if there is one thing I have learned in 40 years it is that once a subject has chosen you — and really that’s how it is, you don’t choose it, it chooses you — it’s a part of your everyday life forever. You have to live and breathe the stuff, remain humble and constantly seek out more knowledge. That’s what I do. So THAT’s how I got into finance. To find out what the hell went wrong back then in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Because to me it wasn’t a “panic,” as former Fed chief Ben Bernanke once put it… It was a disaster! All I know is that whatever THAT was back then, THAT was NOT RIGHT. The academic pursuit of finance, and the wider finance industry itself, should be laser-focused on understanding, preventing, and safeguarding against the inevitable next economic crash. Bitcoin was born in the same fire. It is a potential solution to preventing a Great Recession that it is bound to be even worse than the first. So if you are working in the finance industry, studying finance at university, trading shitcoins on your phone, or playing the leveraged ping-pong game on margin trading sites like BitMEX… ask yourself: Do you feel the same way about finance and cryptocurrency that I do? Because if you’re just trying to “make a bunch of money” and then retire when you’re young, I’m sure there are some other professions you could go into that would make that aspiration more attainable. That way the rest of us can focus on building, creating, supporting, and educating our youth about the financial and technological innovations that will transform our global financial system into an inspiring, equitable, and sustainable one for generations to come.

The company he founded after leaving Steemit, BlockOne, is heavily promoting their event #B1June. One can only assume that the #6 blockchain, according to Coinmarketcap, will try to expand its reach beyond the EOS gambling &amp; gaming dapps that currently dominate the DappRadar Rankings. Gambling &amp; gaming are nice &amp; all but if blockchain wants to truly achieve mass adoption, then the key is obviously to solve for blockchain media. The fact that I am writing this on Steemit proves that Dan Larimer intimately understands this truth. To extend this point, the top 10 dapps on DappRadar cannot boast the daily active users (DAU) that we find on STEEM. According to the latest post by @penguinpablo, more than 45,000 accounts transact on the STEEM blockchain every day. And that doesn’t even count people who just come to Steemit.com, Busy.org, or the @partiko app just to read. While it is certainly the most used blockchain in the world, according to number of daily transactions as tracked by Block’tivity, EOS still has a long way to go in terms of providing real value to its transacting consumers. The event on June 1 is likely to address just that issue. While we’re on this subject, let’s take a look at the Blocktivity league table and give @dan some props: He has been intimately involved in the creation of 3 out of the top 4 most active blockchains. That’s positively Jordanesque. Kudos! Maybe the best summary of what may happen on June 1 can be found here at EOSwriter. If you wanna read just one quote that hints at all the possibilities, you can just read this one from Yves La Rose of EOS Nation: Yves is one of the more sane people I’ve ever encountered in the space. At a meetup in Shanghai earlier this year, he didn’t even appear aware of the price of EOS, much less BTC. His organization is focused on creating value for its community members. And that’s the way it should be. We are still so early in this industry. Those of us involved with projects need to find a way to tune out the moonboys screaming for pump &amp; dump trading action and just hunker down and build blockchain-based ecosystems &amp; communities that provide utility value to token holders. It’s hard, but that’s the way we’re gonna deliver the societal change that blockchain can truly deliver. It’s not about $3,000 bitcoin or $20,000 bitcoin. It’s about changing the world, or whatever little niche each blockchain project chooses to focus on, for the better. 1% at a time.##For me, if the B1 event on June 1 moves the blockchain community as a whole any little bit further along toward this goal, then I am for it! But what do Steemians want to know about this event? How would a B1-backed meOS social media platform built on top of EOS affect the value of STEEM? In the initial stages of meOS, I think it won’t be a problem. Why? Decentralization. EOS is the most centralized token in all of the blockchains. Let’s take a look at the current EOS Whales: That’s 90.85% of the total EOS supply in the hands of its top 15 holders. I know some of these accounts are exchange hot wallets but, uh, that’s not decentralized. Not one bit. Honestly, however, that’s to be expected. Blockchain is supposed to be decentralized, I know. But the reality is, if blockchain-based systems are going to compete with the FAANG-BAT systems that currently rule our digital lives (and disrupting these mega-corps should be the main goal IMHO), they need to be shepherded by powerful incentivized for-profit entities. True decentralization of token supply can only come later in the roadmap. We know this because of the STEEM experience. Here I point to some great posts by @exyle and @taskmaster4450, who both spend a considerable amount of time on their blog talking about STEEM-specific issues. According to this post, near the beginning of the STEEM blockchain the rich-poor gap was very pronounced. It wasn’t as bas as EOS currently is but whales still owned 75.44% of the token supply on 8/1/2017: https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTqYQggdMfyUA5sSb9yvbbwFsx57etKXAJ4J2vrPnspfF The end of the most recent month has seen a remarkable change in the distribution of token supply in the past 21 months. At the end of April 2019, whales only owned 53.16% of the STEEM token supply: https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmY7u7XJxnnwrqEc6QWg17vAWMCRs3fDYUnM3hw2c4baSV That’s substantial progress over the past couple of years. And it is most likely what EOS is trying to replicate by introducing a social media dapp. As Steemit has shown, there is no better way to distribute tokens fairly than by encouraging active participation via incentivization by token reward. All the other means we have encountered via blockchain - mining, transaction mining, staking, delegating, etc. - have all lead to more and more oligarchic systems. If we want oligarchy, we might as well just stay in the fiat world, where the distribution of wealth in the United States is bleak and getting bleaker: So I think it’ll be a couple years before meOS can actually compete with STEEM in this all-important aspect of token supply distribution. It just takes time for a blockchain to be properly “seasoned” in this regard. That being said, obviously the STEEM price is suffering due to the anticipation of the introduction of the “Steem Killer.” To me, this fear presents an interesting “buy the rumor, sell the news” opportunity. The “rumor” being STEEM will be killed and the “news” being it will actually take some time to build up a social media dapp with 45,000 DAUs and a somewhat fairly distributed token economy. How many months of logging into meOS will the top trending post be “Come gamble on EOSdice” or “Bring your friends to trade on Huobi” or “Stake your EOS with eos.fish”? Or whatever… It’s gonna be spam city from all the big EOS whales for a while. And that will only worsen the Whale Problem, at least initially. I have no doubt that @dan and B1 will figure something cool out in the long run. But it will definitely take time. That is just the nature of blockchain development. Rome wasn’t built in a day and all that. Even in a world with a robust meOS ecosystem, that certainly does not spell D-O-O-M for the STEEM blockchain at all. Social media is a space where many ecosystems can thrive simultaneously. Just look at Tumblr being acquired by Yahoo for $1.1 billion back in 2013. The point is, for Chrissakes, let us please have a few social media platforms in this world not owned by Facebook or Tencent! I’m still thinking about this issue and would love to hear any thoughts about #B1June, meOS, or the future of STEEM.

There’s a lot left to think about, but I thought I’d document where I’m at for the moment in hopes of getting some feedback from the awesome STEEM Community. What do we really mean by decentralization?The two definitions of the word “decentralization” are: The transfer of authority from central to local government. As in the following examples, ‘efforts to promote decentralization and reform of the national political party’ or as a modifying adjective in a phrase such as ‘the government’s decentralization program.’ The movement of departments of a large organization away from a single administrative centre to other locations. As in the following examples, ‘the decentralization of business services’ or ‘Kiltimagh is the ideal location for decentralization of IT type projects.’##The obvious takeaway from this basic definition is that when civilians (you can call them no-coiners if you like) talk about decentralization, they are talking about the decentralization of 1. governance and 2. resources. That’s it! The distribution of token supply should not be discussed when we talk about decentralization. That being said, an examination of this definition reveals the most important characteristics when analyzing any blockchain-based economic system. Outside of the OG blockchains like bitcoin, litecoin, and to a certain extent FLO, most of these blockchains are so young that it benefits the designers of new blockchains to consider both the means and the degree to which these systems address: governance resources token distribution Since these three characteristics are maybe a lot to include in one singular concept, and since I am not German enough to bring it all together in one sublime gargantuan word, as Arnold Schoenberg once did with his concept of klangfarbenmelodie in 1911, but still stupid enough to try, we might want to call the systems that we are currently playing at creating crypto-microeconomies. Greed Dominates the Early Stages of Any Crypto-MicroeconomyOne of the most tiresome aspects of the blockchain industry is its seemingly endless tribalism. In my opinion, this current characteristic is simply reflective of how early we are in the development of this burgeoning governance/technology/economy. To emphasize this point, I very much like the distinction presented in this article, “Institutional Cryptoeconomics: A New Model for a New Century”, between general purpose technology and institutional technology. Yes, blockchain, like the steam engine is a game-changer of a general purpose technology, but it is also an institutional technology. And it is one that can entirely reshape the meaning and structure of both our public and private institutions. In the finance world, we dismiss such tribalism by just saying that so and so is “talking their book.” A bitcoin maximalist is most likely that, well, because he holds the private key to a lot of BTC. A proponent of Ethereum touts its long-term prospects, most likely, because he or she bought ETH under $10. EOS people, well, they bought a lot of EOS early on in the 365-day ICO cycle of @dan’s project. That’s understandable. People are, by their very nature, greedy. That’s why it’s the basis of liberal economics. People, on the whole, nearly always act in their own self-interest. This impetus may get redirected, at times, due to competing loyalties to family, nations, etc. But the most logical assumption we can make, and the one we have mostly made since 1776, is just that. People are greedy. Our current economic system is literally built upon this fact. As Milton Friedman famously said, and I maybe too often quote, “The business of business is business.” Everything else in a capitalist economic system should proceed from this rationale. The Economics of the Tech EconomyFrom my perspective, the point of blockchain-based economic systems, or what I’m going to start calling crypto-microeconomies for brevity’s sake, is to corral that notion and use it for good. Essentially, a system developer should aim to take Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” and almost effortlessly point it towards maximizing society for all rather than maximizing profit for some. In the new world of digital-oriented economies, this notion is paramount. Classical liberal economists have for centuries thrived on adjustments based on signals due to various, and often slight, inefficiencies recorded in reaching, or striving to reach, some equilibrium point. The relative equality of such a system lives somewhere in the midst of all those forever slightly changing adjustments. But we now live in a world where adjustments in price and consumer behavior can happen almost instantaneously. The proliferation of “sharing economy” platform businesses has largely been behind this transformation. I’m sure you’ve seen this comment before: The largest transportation company owns no cars (Uber). The largest travel company owns no hotels (Airbnb). The largest media company does not make its own media (Facebook). And on and on… These platforms are merely honeypots for data aggregation. The platform owners then use that data to optimize their platform (in order to maximize profit for some, i.e. their shareholders), which then leads to more data, which leads to better optimization, which then leads to more profit, etc. etc. Boom! Network effects leads to scale and, eventually, monopoly. Such is the curse of modern capitalism. In an era of brutish competition, it works rather well. But in the long run, the goal of every “business doing business” inevitably leads to monopoly, which then squeezes out the competition that provides the fuel for the efficient running of the capitalist machine. That’s why the US and Europe have so fiercely gone after the monopolies that they have observed in the past. Standard Oil, AT&amp;T, Microsoft, etc. But as the nature of politics changes (and corporations co-opt the system within which they operate) and while also the nature of competition itself evolves (from one of price competition to one of data-access competition), it becomes much more difficult to go after monopolies as they occur in real time. Plus, as the tech-based modern economy moves at the speed of Moore’s Law (every 18 months we get twice the capability for half the price, on average), tech behemoths emerge and become gargantuan at an ever-quickening pace, making effective regulation almost impossible. Getting to the Proper DialecticFrom a dialectic perspective, we are spending more and more time in the black-and-white areas of “being” and “nothing” and less and less time in the more intellectually fruitful gray periods of “becoming.” Without the stimulating pursuit of refinement of an idea, we get stuck in our little ruts of Team This or Team That. The few people in this world that would be advocates for the advancement of crypto-microeconomies get forced into roles for Team Bitcoin or Team Ethereum or Team Grin or whatever it is we happen to be holding a bunch of at the moment. Obviously, that’s really bad for Team Crypto. This fracturing allows the elements of the industry with access to the most crypto capital to manipulate prices even further in their favor. Thus, perpetuating the inequality of crypto ecosystems and forever feeding the anti-crypto argument posited by the likes of Nouriel Roubini, who actually testified before the US Senate on October 11, 2018 submitting a document titled “Crypto is the Mother of All Scams and (Now Busted) Bubbles While Blockchain Is The Most Over-Hyped Technology Ever, No Better than a Spreadsheet/Database”. I have no idea why we keep in-fighting amongst ourselves (well, actually, I do. It is just greed.) when these are the kinds of things that are trotted out as arguments against bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto with regularity. The most recent example of whales acting for the profit for some over improving society for all was the obvious “borrow and short” BTC flash crash on Bitstamp on Friday, May 17, 2019. There were rumors on the scene for weeks of a certain actor gobbling up a bunch of BTC while willing to pay a significant monthly interest rate. This is such a basic finance move (borrow an asset, short it with leverage, sell the asset at market, then buy the asset back at lower prices) that I’m surprised we haven’t seen more of this kind of manipulation already. The end result, however, is now we have an even more skewed distribution of BTC. But notice how I do not say, “Now we have an even more centralized BTC supply.” That’s just not the proper dialectic. For governance and resources, I think the proper dialectic is between “centralized” and “decentralized.” Having defined this relationship properly gives us the correct perspective on what actions lead to the “becoming” of the system. However, with regard to token supply, we must define the dialectic as between “concentrated” and “distributed.” With this proper perspective, we can evaluate the influence of our actions on each crypto-microeconomy more precisely. Great! Now that we’ve cleared up those semantics, I think we can move on next time to how exactly one might achieve a properly “distributed” token economy. And no, I don’t think the answer is airdrops!  Thanks for reading and… As always, PEACE! ✌ This page is synchronized from the post: On Decentralization, Dialectics, &amp; the Distribution of Token Supply document.querySelectorAll('.not-gallery-item') .forEach(el => { if (!el.dataset.src) { return; } const img = document.createElement('img'); img.style = 'display:none !important;'; img.src = el.dataset.src; img.addEventListener('error', () => { img.remove(); el.style.color = 'inherit'; el.style.backgroundImage = 'none'; el.style.background = 'none'; }); img.addEventListener('load', () => { img.remove(); }); document.body.appendChild(img); });","link":"/@shanghaipreneur/on-decentralization-dialectics-and-the-distribution-of-token-supply/"},{"title":"Another day.

In the past 24 hours a fork of a fork of bitcoin, led by a man who has been widely discredited as the originator of the bitcoin code but still enjoys clinging on to the idea that he is The Real Satoshi, has more than doubled in price. The reason for the rise is, seemingly, because of a similarly widely discredited rumor. Or as the current US president would probably say: FAKE NEWS!!! And yet, you know what they say… money talks… and bullshit walks. Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV or BCHSV, if you are a crypto trader) was reported to have reached a deal with Changpeng Zhao (CZ) of Binance to be re-listed. The coin had been previously de-listed in response to some threats that Faketoshi (which the BSV founder is often called by his very vocal critics) made toward an online feline. No, I’m not making this up: Faketoshi v. Fakecat. The kitty is so afraid that it has not yet turned back up on the Twittersphere. And that somehow led to CZ &amp; Crew getting angry enough to cost this guy some money. That disagreement had reportedly (at least according to the very reputable Chinese news outlet Coin Double Bull 樂- again, I’m not kidding, you can check out 币牛牛 here) been smoothed over by a 50,000 BTC transfer (approx. value $400MM) from the genesis wallet by the Prof. BSV to CZ’s company. Nevermind the absurdity of all this… Like, why would anyone just send someone $400 million out of the blue and with no guarantee of resolution. But China folks saw it in their very favorite WeChat groups, so it must be true! Buy buy buy! And so the blockchain world moves forward into what is shaping up to be one epic Summer Of Bitcoin.
