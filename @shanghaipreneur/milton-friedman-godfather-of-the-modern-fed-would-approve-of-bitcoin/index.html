            <p>I recently came across an old Milton Friedman interview wherein he basically predicted Bitcoin would happen a full 10 years before it actually did.</p>
<p>Why is Milton Friedman important? We&#x2019;ll get to that in a minute. First, let&#x2019;s take a look at the old guy.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmYFVEnkSVd6Y8cPz3by3MYxMM64mdB31NuwM7EFGnuVkC/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Not exactly a software visionary, right? In this picture in particular he looks like he is trying to explain how a pencil works, like it was some kind of newfangled tech. I mean this guy was way old even back in 1999, when he said the following in an interview that has, for some reason, struck me as a very important quote today:</p>

<p>I mean that&#x2019;s a remarkably prescient statement for a super old guy who hadn&#x2019;t even seen a smartphone or YouTube yet. (He died in 2006 at the age of 94.) I remember 1999&#x2026; Not many of us around back then even knew what Google was!</p>
<p>And here is the architect of the extant modern financial system warning, dare I say advocating even, something he called</p>
<h2 id="e-cash"><a href="#e-cash" class="headerlink" title="e-cash"></a>e-cash</h2><p>##</p>

<p>In order to truly understand the importance of Friedman making a statement like this, one has to understand the rather substantial role he played in shaping the world&#x2019;s current economic order.</p>
<p>In the original form of the American-derived post-war international monetary system, the Bretton Woods system was a gold exchange standard with the US dollar (USD) as the only medium of exchange. Due to a long-standing conceit that interest rate jawboning by the Fed had cost Tricky Dick his first presidential election in 1960, the Nixon administration placed great weight on the power of the Federal Reserve System and its ability to both foster and direct American economic hegemony. At this time, in the Bretton Woods system of old, the essential status of the USD provided great international economic influence. But due to the very nature of international trade, which had been born at a time when gold was by far the internationally accepted store of value, the dollar had a tenuous hold on its global economic sway. The Bretton Woods System originally was constructed so that in order to exchange any national currency for gold, one had to first exchange that currency for USD. The USD was the only international currency that enjoyed this convertibility. As a result, all other currencies were pegged to it.</p>
<p>It was a privileged position.</p>
<p>Kinda like the United Kingdom enjoys being able to print British pounds as legal tender and still stay in the European Union. Only better.</p>
<p>But Nixon wanted more. He sensed a bigger prize. Moreover, the original Bretton Woods system was creaking under the weight of its assumptions. The United States continued to expand its money supply, thereby putting pressure on its ability to maintain gold reserves to cover those held by foreign central banks. It was kind of a ruse. Most countries kind of expected that the US could not withstand a run on their gold deposits. Then in 1965, Charles de Gaulle announced his intention to call America&#x2019;s bluff. He wanted the gold that was entitled to France by its enormous US dollar stockpile.</p>
<p>As other countries began to follow suit, it seemed that a portion of the pillar of America&#x2019;s economic might could easily be taken away. Switzerland and France announced their intention to redeem over $241 million of their dollar reserves for gold specie in 1971. More redemptions were on the horizon. In response, Nixon secretly cloistered his financial team at Camp David. Afterwards, he brashly severed the link between gold and the USD. The gold exchange standard was no more when Nixon made the following statement on national TV:</p>

<p>At the time, the &#x201C;Nixon Shock&#x201D; was seen as a short-term reactionary move designed to bully European allies into a desperately needed revaluation of their currencies. By 1973, however, all the major international currencies floated freely against each other 24 hours a day in an orgy of price movements without government intervention. This new form of the international financial system characterizes the &#x201C;ultimate objective&#x201D; (33) of Friedman&#x2019;s seminal 1962 work <em>Capitalism and Freedom</em>. The end of the fixed exchange rate mechanism birthed the volatile high-stakes world of hedge funds and high-frequency traders, the unintentional trademarks of modern international finance. </p>
<p>Friedman believed that a freely floating exchange rate system would be &#x201C;highly stable because basic economic policies and conditions are stable&#x201D; (69). In other words, economic reality would eventually reflect the theoretical perfection of economic theory. However, the Nixon Shock itself proved that economic policies are hardly, if ever, &#x201C;stable.&#x201D; Perhaps this utopian dream of classic neoliberal <em>laissez-faire</em> economics could have been realized upon a blank slate economy. But a greenfield did not exist.</p>
<p>Many observers at the time claimed that Bretton Woods was dead. Retrospectives were authored. Lessons from the system&#x2019;s demise were cataloged. But a funny thing happened on the way to the cemetery. The Bretton Woods &#x201C;sister organizations&#x201D; &#x2013; IMF, the World Bank, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which later provided the framework for the World Trade Organization (WTO) &#x2013; over time became increasingly powerful. And the main mechanism through which global central banks could intervene in the currency markets - their country&#x2019;s exchange rate with the USD - was replaced by Friedman&#x2019;s freely floating exchange rate regime.</p>
<p>That freely floating mechanism, however, never became currency agnostic. Instead, and curiously almost, it maintained the premium on USD accumulation. Central banks had already amassed, and never redeemed, vast amounts of USD assets in their official reserve portfolios during the pre-Nixon era of full dollar convertibility into gold.</p>
<p>Gold or not, it seemed they were hooked.</p>
<p>Advantage: United States of America.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has a global monopoly on currency. It literally can create out of thin air the world&#x2019;s most valuable financial asset. That ability has profound ramifications on the means which other central banks can employ to stay relevant in international trade. As Barry Eichengreen put it in his excellent book <em>Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International Monetary System</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries had to pony up $100 of actual goods in order to obtain one.&#x201D;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The international monetary order after the &#x201C;Nixon Shock&#x201D; was even more slanted in favor of the US. To underscore not only that a free-floating USD would not destroy the Bretton Woods regime but also the influence which the United States wielded at the Bretton Woods&#x2019; sister organizations, President Nixon&#x2019;s TV announcement ending dollar-gold convertibility made sure to include the words &#x201C;in full cooperation with the IMF.&#x201D; &#x1F602;&#x1F923;&#x1F602;</p>
<p>Why do I laugh?</p>
<p>Well let&#x2019;s just take a look at how that worked out.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmNkstRMiNFvmxSX5DSGAUwhsEkDB4iM7jhjcvAw9rv1n7/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And it doesn&#x2019;t end there. It just keeps on rolling. You can check for yourself at the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St Louis Fed website</a>. The Fed just keeps printing money. We are at nearly $14 trillion in current M3 money supply with no end of the inflation (and corresponding dollar devaluation) in sight.</p>
<p>So when I heard recently that Friedman had basically predicted the rise of Bitcoin, the preceding extensive backstory is why I took notice. has been the dream ever since we made up this thing called the internet.</p>
<p>Because if even old Milton <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/studentgroups/libertarians/issues/friedman-soc-resp-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#x201C;The Business of Business is to do Business&#x201D;</a> Friedman was waiting for this &#x201C;e-cash&#x201D;, I wonder why the Federal Reserve System didn&#x2019;t anticipate it.</p>
<p>And more importantly, why are we still waiting for an official regulatory opinion?</p>
<p>When it came to the Great Recession, we basically listened to Friedman. According to a 2011 report provided to the Federal Reserve Board, Edward Nelson stated, &#x201C;in important respects, the overall monetary and financial policy response to the crisis can be viewed as Friedman&#x2019;s monetary economics in practice.&#x201D; He also claimed that &#x201C;Friedman&#x2019;s recommendations for responding to a financial crisis largely lined up with the principal financial and monetary policy measures taken since 2007.&#x201D; </p>
<p>I mean if we are going to continue on with letting Friedman theories dictate our monetary policy, we should be letting all cryptocurrencies &#x201C;freely float&#x201D;, right? Friedman&#x2019;s emphasis on freedom as an <em>a priori</em> notion demands a light regulatory regime, no?</p>
<p>Or has the entire bureaucracy governing American monetary policy stopped listening to Milton Friedman?</p>
<p>Has the Fed forgotten its godfather?</p>
