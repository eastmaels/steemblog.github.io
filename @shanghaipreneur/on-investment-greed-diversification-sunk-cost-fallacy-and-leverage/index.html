        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I didn&#x2019;t invest a lot of money into cryptocurrency and digital assets back in 2017. I remember thinking what a big deal it was when I decided to put 1% of my investment portfolio into BTC, ETH, and NEO (of all things! &#x1F629;). To me, that was a reasonable amount to invest, relatively, into magic internet money.</p>
<p>I think, in the runup to the miraculous bull run of late 2017 and early 2018, I may have let myself get caught up in the frenzy enough that I contributed approximately 5% of my investment capital into cryptocurrency and then, through appreciation alone,  that got up to about 15%. I took a little profit in early 2018 but, of course in retrospect, not enough.</p>
<p>But that&#x2019;s on me. I&#x2019;m not blaming anyone for those &#x201C;losses.&#x201D; Because, really, they&#x2019;re not actual losses. Just like they&#x2019;re not gains until you sell, whatever I had on paper in January 2018, I really didn&#x2019;t have in actual value. Who knows? If I had tried to sell NEO at $185 I might have crashed the market with my bag!</p>
<p>I now know what caused me to miss out on those profits. And that had nothing to do with anything else but me. What caused me to do what in retrospect was so stupid? That&#x2019;s easy.</p>
<h2 id="Greed"><a href="#Greed" class="headerlink" title="Greed."></a>Greed.</h2><p>##<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmeBPpjPA2m9sWe8RkWpN8pbXb2qMspZo1Vn1jT7AZhpk6/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>##<br>To put it simply, I thought NEO was going to $300. To this day, I&#x2019;m not ever sure what my logic was, but I distinctly remember thinking that on multiple occasions. </p>
<p>Oh well. Live and learn. &#x1F937;&#x1F3FB;&#x200D;&#x2642;&#xFE0F;</p>
<h2 id="The-great-thing-about-life-is-that-you-get-to-live-another-day-and-try-and-do-better-next-time"><a href="#The-great-thing-about-life-is-that-you-get-to-live-another-day-and-try-and-do-better-next-time" class="headerlink" title="The great thing about life is that you get to live another day and try and do better next time."></a>The great thing about life is that you get to live another day and try and do better next time.</h2><p>##<br>What I am most thankful for in this experience is that I had studied portfolio management long and hard enough to avoid the single most common pitfall that pretty much singlehandedly REKT anybody who stayed invested in crypto in 2018. I mean it sounds so simple when you say it but, in fact, it is quite difficult. Emotions usually get the better of most of us. So it&#x2019;s important to have established some rational guidelines you can harken back to BEFORE things get emotional.</p>
<p>Probably the most important guidance for investors is easier said than done.</p>
<h2 id="Don&#x2019;t-put-all-your-eggs-in-one-basket"><a href="#Don&#x2019;t-put-all-your-eggs-in-one-basket" class="headerlink" title="Don&#x2019;t put all your eggs in one basket."></a>Don&#x2019;t put all your eggs in one basket.</h2><p>##<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbSadDymYR4MEJ5NpN6yC9h4aTK1fHw7kq1UsMoPynUWJ/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Because the chances are high when you do that that you are gonna break some eggs. Just like this. I mean that brilliant investment idea that you think no one else has and you are ready to go AWL EEN on? It just might work out. Or it might not. If you lose all your powder in one last showdown, you might go down in a blaze of glory, but you ain&#x2019;t playing again. Not with that capital, at least. So maximize your chances while ensuring that you live to see another day. And play again.</p>
<p>And yet, I still hear about people who put money into coins crying, &#x201C;I lost millions.&#x201D; Or in Chinese, &#x201C;&#x6211;&#x7684;&#x4E09;&#x767E;&#x4E07;&#x53D8;&#x6210;20&#x4E07;&#x3002;(My 3 million has become 200,000!) Well, that&#x2019;s awful. But did you really do that without &#x201C;millions&#x201D; invested in other assets? That&#x2019;s just crazy. I can&#x2019;t imagine going all in on digital assets, literally, to where they were 100% of my investment portfolio. I mean maybe once we have security tokens and a reliable wallet to store them in&#x2026;  but we are far from that right now.</p>
<p>Intuitively, I think most people understand that. But when emotions get involved, the picture is much cloudier. For instance, nearly everyone, including myself, falls prey to the great killer of investment alpha: the sunk cost fallacy.</p>
<h2 id="The-sunk-cost-fallacy-leads-investors-to-throw-good-money-after-bad-by-doubling-down-on-their-worst-investments-so-that-they-can-&#x201C;more-quickly-get-their-money-back-&#x201D;"><a href="#The-sunk-cost-fallacy-leads-investors-to-throw-good-money-after-bad-by-doubling-down-on-their-worst-investments-so-that-they-can-&#x201C;more-quickly-get-their-money-back-&#x201D;" class="headerlink" title="The sunk cost fallacy leads investors to throw good money after bad by doubling down on their worst investments, so that they can &#x201C;more quickly get their money back.&#x201D;"></a>The sunk cost fallacy leads investors to throw good money after bad by doubling down on their worst investments, so that they can &#x201C;more quickly get their money back.&#x201D;</h2><p>##<br>Yeah, somehow way back in the lizard part of your brain, it sounds good to lower your cost basis. I guess the thinking is that your investment, once it eventually goes back to your original buy-in price, will bring you that much more in return at that point. The problem is that IT MIGHT NEVER GO BACK TO THAT PRICE EVER AGAIN. The logic here is flawed.</p>
<p>Instead of investing money in your best ideas at the moment, the ones which supposedly have the most potential to gain at that precise time, you invest in an idea simply because you have invested in it before. It is literally like saying, &#x201C;The last time I ate this food it made me sick. So I will eat it again because maybe now I have built an immunity to it, and if not, maybe this time I eat it and get sick will get me that much closer to a time where eventually I can eat it and not got sick.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Yay!</p>

<p>Greed, lack of portfolio diversification, and sunk cost fallacy are some of the reasons why most people fail to outperform even a basic stock index fund like <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY?p=SPY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPY</a>. But by far the worst investor trait that young investors use to try and CRUSH the markets, the most dangerous threat to your financial independence surely, is leverage.</p>
<h2 id="Leverage-itself-is-neither-good-nor-bad-It-merely-amplifies-your-investment-decisions"><a href="#Leverage-itself-is-neither-good-nor-bad-It-merely-amplifies-your-investment-decisions" class="headerlink" title="Leverage itself is neither good nor bad. It merely amplifies your investment decisions."></a>Leverage itself is neither good nor bad. It merely amplifies your investment decisions.</h2><p>##<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmPGEQUnuvoz12oyQ1UH4sJWyDx66oHuiVpNjWXZRjfHrr/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But that is why when you are young and inexperienced, on its face, borrowing money to make investments is a decidedly bad idea. Without investing experience, you are just amplifying your learning curve. That&#x2019;s not very likely to be a winning formula. Most of the world&#x2019;s best investors, like Warren Buffett or Bill Ackman, don&#x2019;t really hit their stride until they are well into their 40s and 50s.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you are using leverage, and if that money is coming from friends and family, and they do not agree to the sharing of the investment risk, it can destroy relationships. If that money is borrowed on your own behalf, and the investment does not perform according to your expectations, you could be hamstringing yourself for years, or even decades.</p>
<p>So don&#x2019;t do it!</p>
<p>And yet, every time there is a bull run in some asset class, the same process is repeated. The smart money that has played this game over and over again throughout their lives come in and grab their 50% to 100%. Then calmly leave out the front door, leaving a mass of noob retail investors to fight over the last 20% to 30% scraps at the top. Firmly secure atop their pile of cash, waiting for the next bubble to appear in some other asset class at a later date, these guys watch as everything crashes around the retail investors, 60-70-80% losses in some unfortunate positions are the norm in such a situation. And if you committed one of the &#x201C;capital&#x201D; sins above anywhere near that bull market top&#x2026; Well, God help you.</p>
<p>The only thing left for you to do is pick yourself up and </p>
