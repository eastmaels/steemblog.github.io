        <div class="content">
            <p>My last post on <a href="https://steemit.com/crypto/@shanghaipreneur/on-decentralization-dialectics-and-the-distribution-of-token-supply" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 3 D&#x2019;s of Crypto</a> went a little deep, so I thought I&#x2019;d throw a little basic reportage into the feed here.</p>
<p>In the past 24 hours a fork of a fork of bitcoin, led by a man who has been widely discredited as the originator of the bitcoin code but still enjoys clinging on to the idea that he is The Real Satoshi, has more than doubled in price. The reason for the rise is, seemingly, because of  a similarly widely discredited rumor.</p>
<p>Or as the current US president would probably say: <a href="https://todaysgazette.com/fake-chinese-news-on-binance-craig-wright-pumps-bitcoin-sv-bsv-by-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAKE NEWS!!!</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbaVfMVD2MgGVDTemHsm6GdPjF2shDcffXB5gUaphAJA4/trump-press-fake-news.jpg" alt="trump-press-fake-news.jpg"></p>
<p>And yet, you know what they say&#x2026; money talks&#x2026; and bullshit walks.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Satoshi&#x2019;s Vision (BSV or BCHSV, if you are a crypto trader) was reported to have reached a deal with Changpeng Zhao (CZ) of Binance to be re-listed. The coin had been previously de-listed in response to some threats that Faketoshi (which the BSV founder is often called by his very vocal critics) made toward an online feline.</p>
<p>No, I&#x2019;m not making this up: Faketoshi v. Fakecat. The kitty is so afraid that it has not yet turned back up on the Twittersphere.</p>
<p>And that somehow led to CZ &amp; Crew getting angry enough to cost this guy some money.</p>
<p>That disagreement had reportedly (at least according to the very reputable Chinese news outlet Coin Double Bull &#x1F914;- again, I&#x2019;m not kidding, you can check out &#x5E01;&#x725B;&#x725B; <a href="http://www.jinsenw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) been smoothed over by a 50,000 BTC transfer (approx. value $400MM) from the genesis wallet by the Prof. BSV to CZ&#x2019;s company.</p>
<p>Nevermind the absurdity of all this&#x2026; Like, why would anyone just send someone $400 million out of the blue and with no guarantee of resolution.</p>
<p>But China folks saw it in their very favorite WeChat groups, so it must be true!</p>
<p>Buy buy buy!</p>
<p>And so the blockchain world moves forward into what is shaping up to be one epic Summer Of Bitcoin.</p>

        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Ever since my post last week about the <a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@shanghaipreneur/on-the-future-of-steem-and-meos-the-steem-killer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incoming EOS competitor to STEEM to be called MEOS</a>, most of my thinking about blockchain and cryptocurrency has been directed towards the conundrum of how, in the long run, to effectively distribute a token&#x2019;s supply. There&#x2019;s a lot left to think about, but I thought I&#x2019;d document where I&#x2019;m at for the moment in hopes of getting some feedback from the awesome STEEM Community.</p>
<h2 id="What-do-we-really-mean-by-decentralization"><a href="#What-do-we-really-mean-by-decentralization" class="headerlink" title="What do we really mean by decentralization?"></a>What do we really mean by decentralization?</h2><p>The two definitions of the word &#x201C;decentralization&#x201D; are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The transfer of authority from central to local government. As in the following examples,<ul>
<li>&#x2018;efforts to promote <em>decentralization</em> and reform of the national political party&#x2019; or</li>
<li>as a modifying adjective in a phrase such as &#x2018;the government&#x2019;s <em>decentralization</em> program.&#x2019;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The movement of departments of a large organization away from a single administrative centre to other locations. As in the following examples,<ul>
<li>&#x2018;the <em>decentralization</em> of business services&#x2019; or</li>
<li>&#x2018;Kiltimagh is the ideal location for <em>decentralization</em> of IT type projects.&#x2019;<br>##<br>The obvious takeaway from this basic definition is that when civilians (you can call them no-coiners if you like) talk about decentralization, they are talking about the decentralization of 1. governance and 2. resources. That&#x2019;s it! The distribution of token supply should not be discussed when we talk about <em>decentralization</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That being said, an examination of this definition reveals the most important characteristics when analyzing any blockchain-based economic system. Outside of the OG blockchains like bitcoin, litecoin, and to a certain extent <a href="https://www.flo.cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FLO</a>, most of these blockchains are so young that it benefits the designers of new blockchains to consider both the means and the degree to which these systems address:</p>
<ol>
<li>governance</li>
<li>resources</li>
<li>token distribution</li>
</ol>
<p>Since these three characteristics are maybe a lot to include in one singular concept, and since I am not German enough to bring it all together in one sublime gargantuan word, as Arnold Schoenberg once did with his concept of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynahZfiIlEk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>klangfarbenmelodie</em></a> in 1911, but still stupid enough to try, we might want to call the systems that we are currently playing at creating <em>crypto-microeconomies</em>.</p>
<h2 id="Greed-Dominates-the-Early-Stages-of-Any-Crypto-Microeconomy"><a href="#Greed-Dominates-the-Early-Stages-of-Any-Crypto-Microeconomy" class="headerlink" title="Greed Dominates the Early Stages of Any Crypto-Microeconomy"></a>Greed Dominates the Early Stages of Any Crypto-Microeconomy</h2><p>One of the most tiresome aspects of the blockchain industry is its seemingly endless tribalism. In my opinion, this current characteristic is simply reflective of how early we are in the development of this burgeoning governance/technology/economy. To emphasize this point, I very much like the distinction presented in this article, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/institutional-cryptoeconomics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#x201C;Institutional Cryptoeconomics: A New Model for a New Century&#x201D;</a>, between <em>general purpose</em> technology and <em>institutional</em> technology. Yes, blockchain, like the steam engine is a game-changer of a <em>general purpose</em> technology, but it is also an <em>institutional</em> technology. And it is one that can entirely reshape the meaning and structure of <em>both</em> our public and private institutions.</p>
<p>In the finance world, we dismiss such tribalism by just saying that so and so is &#x201C;talking their book.&#x201D; A bitcoin maximalist is most likely that, well, because he holds the private key to a lot of BTC. A proponent of Ethereum touts its long-term prospects, most likely, because he or she bought ETH under $10. EOS people, well, they bought a lot of EOS early on in the 365-day ICO cycle of @dan&#x2019;s project.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s understandable. People are, by their very nature, greedy. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s the basis of liberal economics. People, on the whole, nearly always act in their own self-interest. This impetus may get redirected, at times, due to competing loyalties to family, nations, etc. But the most logical assumption we can make, and the one we have mostly made since 1776, is just that. People are greedy. Our current economic system is literally built upon this fact.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPqdRqacpFk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milton Friedman</a> famously said, and I maybe too often quote, &#x201C;The business of business is business.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Everything else in a capitalist economic system should proceed from this rationale.</p>
<h2 id="The-Economics-of-the-Tech-Economy"><a href="#The-Economics-of-the-Tech-Economy" class="headerlink" title="The Economics of the Tech Economy"></a>The Economics of the Tech Economy</h2><p>From my perspective, the point of blockchain-based economic systems, or what I&#x2019;m going to start calling crypto-microeconomies for brevity&#x2019;s sake, is to corral that notion and use it for good. Essentially, a system developer should aim to take Adam Smith&#x2019;s &#x201C;invisible hand&#x201D; and almost effortlessly point it towards maximizing <em>society for all</em> rather than maximizing <em>profit for some</em>.</p>
<p>In the new world of digital-oriented economies, this notion is paramount. Classical liberal economists have for centuries thrived on adjustments based on signals due to various, and often slight, inefficiencies recorded in reaching, or striving to reach, some equilibrium point. The relative equality of such a system lives somewhere in the midst of all those forever slightly changing adjustments.</p>
<p>But we now live in a world where adjustments in price and consumer behavior can happen almost instantaneously. The proliferation of &#x201C;sharing economy&#x201D; platform businesses has largely been behind this transformation. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve seen this comment before: The largest transportation company owns no cars (Uber). The largest travel company owns no hotels (Airbnb). The largest media company does not make its own media (Facebook). And on and on&#x2026; These platforms are merely honeypots for data aggregation. The platform owners then use that data to optimize their platform (in order to maximize <em>profit for some</em>, i.e. their shareholders), which then leads to more data, which leads to better optimization, which then leads to more profit, etc. etc. Boom! Network effects leads to scale and, eventually, monopoly.</p>
<p>Such is the curse of modern capitalism. In an era of brutish competition, it works rather well. But in the long run, the goal of every &#x201C;business doing business&#x201D; inevitably leads to monopoly, which then squeezes out the competition that provides the fuel for the efficient running of the capitalist machine. That&#x2019;s why the US and Europe have so fiercely gone after the monopolies that they have observed in the past. Standard Oil, AT&amp;T, Microsoft, etc.</p>
<p>But as the nature of politics changes (and corporations co-opt the system within which they operate) and while also the nature of competition itself evolves (from one of price competition to one of data-access competition), it becomes much more difficult to go after monopolies as they occur in real time. Plus, as the tech-based modern economy moves at the speed of Moore&#x2019;s Law (every 18 months we get twice the capability for half the price, on average), tech behemoths emerge and become gargantuan at an ever-quickening pace, making effective regulation almost impossible.</p>

<h2 id="Getting-to-the-Proper-Dialectic"><a href="#Getting-to-the-Proper-Dialectic" class="headerlink" title="Getting to the Proper Dialectic"></a>Getting to the Proper Dialectic</h2><p>From a dialectic perspective, we are spending more and more time in the black-and-white areas of &#x201C;being&#x201D; and &#x201C;nothing&#x201D; and less and less time in the more intellectually fruitful gray periods of &#x201C;becoming.&#x201D; Without the stimulating pursuit of refinement of an idea, we get stuck in our little ruts of Team This or Team That. The few people in this world that would be advocates for the advancement of crypto-microeconomies get forced into roles for Team Bitcoin or Team Ethereum or Team Grin or whatever it is we happen to be holding a bunch of at the moment.</p>
<p>Obviously, that&#x2019;s really bad for Team Crypto. This fracturing allows the elements of the industry with access to the most crypto capital to manipulate prices even further in their favor. Thus, perpetuating the inequality of crypto ecosystems and forever feeding the anti-crypto argument posited by the likes of Nouriel Roubini, who actually testified before the US Senate on October 11, 2018 submitting a <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Roubini%20Testimony%2010-11-18.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">document titled &#x201C;Crypto is the Mother of All Scams and (Now Busted) Bubbles While Blockchain Is The Most Over-Hyped Technology Ever, No Better than a Spreadsheet/Database&#x201D;</a>. I have no idea why we keep in-fighting amongst ourselves (well, actually, I do. It is just greed.) when these are the kinds of things that are trotted out as arguments against bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto with regularity.</p>
<p>The most recent example of whales acting for the <em>profit for some</em> over improving <em>society for all</em> was the obvious &#x201C;borrow and short&#x201D; BTC flash crash on Bitstamp on Friday, May 17, 2019.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbrVZDWGMRHhznhXiJHWubpmkETJ4cMzsroJUd3fJNVTP/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There were rumors on the scene for weeks of a certain actor gobbling up a bunch of BTC while willing to pay a significant monthly interest rate. This is such a basic finance move (borrow an asset, short it with leverage, sell the asset at market, then buy the asset back at lower prices) that I&#x2019;m surprised we haven&#x2019;t seen more of this kind of manipulation already. The end result, however, is now we have an even more skewed distribution of BTC. But notice how I do not say, &#x201C;Now we have an even more centralized BTC supply.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s just not the proper dialectic.</p>
<p>For governance and resources, I think the proper dialectic is between &#x201C;centralized&#x201D; and &#x201C;decentralized.&#x201D; Having defined this relationship properly gives us the correct perspective on what actions lead to the &#x201C;becoming&#x201D; of the system.</p>
<p>However, with regard to token supply, we must define the dialectic as between &#x201C;concentrated&#x201D; and &#x201C;distributed.&#x201D; With this proper perspective, we can evaluate the influence of our actions on each crypto-microeconomy more precisely.</p>
<p>Great! Now that we&#x2019;ve cleared up those semantics, I think we can move on next time to how exactly one might achieve a <em>properly</em> &#x201C;distributed&#x201D; token economy. And no, I don&#x2019;t think the answer is airdrops! &#x1F609;</p>

            <p>In a few weeks, @dan will supposedly release his &#x201C;Steem Killer&#x201D; on EOS. The company he founded after leaving Steemit, BlockOne, is heavily promoting their event <a href="https://block.one/june1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#B1June</a>. One can only assume that the #6 blockchain, according to Coinmarketcap, will try to expand its reach beyond the EOS gambling &amp; gaming dapps that currently dominate the <a href="https://dappradar.com/rankings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DappRadar Rankings</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmeoj4DGj4dstE1Ekcw1L1GMifZmsM4sN1AYcgU1R3zHmf/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Gambling &amp; gaming are nice &amp; all but if blockchain wants to truly achieve mass adoption, then the key is obviously to solve for blockchain media. The fact that I am writing this on Steemit proves that Dan Larimer intimately understands this truth. To extend this point, the top 10 dapps on DappRadar cannot boast the daily active users (DAU) that we find on STEEM.</p>
<p>According to the latest <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@penguinpablo/daily-steem-stats-report-friday-may-17-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> by @penguinpablo, more than 45,000 accounts transact on the STEEM blockchain every day. And that doesn&#x2019;t even count people who just come to Steemit.com, <a href="https://busy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Busy.org</a>, or the <a href="https://partiko.app/referral/shanghaipreneur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@partiko app</a> just to read.</p>
<p>While it is certainly the most used blockchain in the world, according to number of daily transactions as tracked by <a href="https://www.blocktivity.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Block&#x2019;tivity</a>, EOS still has a long way to go in terms of providing real value to its transacting consumers. The event on June 1 is likely to address just that issue.</p>
<p>While we&#x2019;re on this subject, let&#x2019;s take a look at the Blocktivity league table and give @dan some props:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmegoc5ir4YfRL8tt3QXJYjTCJr4RC6qVjAkibnmvTcrDC/Screen%20Shot%202019-05-19%20at%2010.32.33%20AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-05-19 at 10.32.33 AM.png"></p>
<p>He has been intimately involved in the creation of 3 out of the top 4 most active blockchains. That&#x2019;s positively Jordanesque. Kudos!</p>
<p>Maybe the best summary of what may happen on June 1 can be found here at <a href="https://www.eoswriter.io/373_on-the-1st-of-june-block-one-will.eos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EOSwriter</a>. If you wanna read just one quote that hints at all the possibilities, you can just read this one from Yves La Rose of <a href="https://eosnation.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EOS Nation</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmSdbMvGNR3CwmBqEWAsFM5hQmMurcGTXZ5JRWc17f7zak/Screen%20Shot%202019-05-19%20at%2011.07.51%20AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-05-19 at 11.07.51 AM.png"></p>
<p>Yves is one of the more sane people I&#x2019;ve ever encountered in the space. At a meetup in Shanghai earlier this year, he didn&#x2019;t even appear aware of the price of EOS, much less BTC. His organization is focused on creating value for its community members. And that&#x2019;s the way it should be. We are still so early in this industry. Those of us involved with projects need to find a way to tune out the moonboys screaming for pump &amp; dump trading action and just hunker down and build blockchain-based ecosystems &amp; communities that provide utility value to token holders. It&#x2019;s hard, but that&#x2019;s the way we&#x2019;re gonna deliver the societal change that blockchain can truly deliver.</p>
<h2 id="It&#x2019;s-not-about-3-000-bitcoin-or-20-000-bitcoin-It&#x2019;s-about-changing-the-world-or-whatever-little-niche-each-blockchain-project-chooses-to-focus-on-for-the-better-1-at-a-time"><a href="#It&#x2019;s-not-about-3-000-bitcoin-or-20-000-bitcoin-It&#x2019;s-about-changing-the-world-or-whatever-little-niche-each-blockchain-project-chooses-to-focus-on-for-the-better-1-at-a-time" class="headerlink" title="It&#x2019;s not about $3,000 bitcoin or $20,000 bitcoin.

It&#x2019;s about changing the world, or whatever little niche each blockchain project chooses to focus on, for the better. 1% at a time.</h2><p>##<br>For me, if the B1 event on June 1 moves the blockchain community as a whole any little bit further along toward this goal, then I am for it!</p>
<p>But what do Steemians want to know about this event? How would a B1-backed meOS social media platform built on top of EOS affect the value of STEEM?</p>
<p>In the initial stages of meOS, I think it won&#x2019;t be a problem. Why? Decentralization.</p>
<p>EOS is the most centralized token in all of the blockchains. Let&#x2019;s take a look at the current <a href="https://eosflare.io/whales" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EOS Whales</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUjS3n2xTaEPeNuuLu3ayMjTDGcadkm8KtxKZyAVvMtcn/Screen%20Shot%202019-05-19%20at%2011.32.58%20AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-05-19 at 11.32.58 AM.png"></p>
<p>That&#x2019;s 90.85% of the total EOS supply in the hands of its top 15 holders. I know some of these accounts are exchange hot wallets but, uh, that&#x2019;s not decentralized. Not one bit.</p>
<p>Honestly, however, that&#x2019;s to be expected. Blockchain is supposed to be decentralized, I know. But the reality is, if blockchain-based systems are going to compete with the FAANG-BAT systems that currently rule our digital lives (and disrupting these mega-corps should be the main goal IMHO), they need to be shepherded by powerful incentivized for-profit entities. True decentralization of token supply can only come later in the roadmap.</p>
<p>We know this because of the STEEM experience. Here I point to some great <a href="https://steemit.com/exyle/@exyle/powerdown-statistics-10-april-23rd-may-6th-vested-steem-has-gone-up#@shanghaipreneur/shanghaipreneur-re-exyle-powerdown-statistics-10-april-23rd-may-6th-vested-steem-has-gone-up-20190506t104208302z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posts</a> by @exyle and @taskmaster4450, who both spend a considerable amount of time on their blog talking about STEEM-specific issues.</p>
<p>According to this <a href="https://steemit.com/busy/@taskmaster4450/steem-whales-are-losing-their-power-the-system-is-not-broken-report-through-4-30-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a>, near the beginning of the STEEM blockchain the rich-poor gap was very pronounced. It wasn&#x2019;t as bas as EOS currently is but whales still owned 75.44% of the token supply on 8/1/2017:</p>
<p><a href="https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTqYQggdMfyUA5sSb9yvbbwFsx57etKXAJ4J2vrPnspfF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTqYQggdMfyUA5sSb9yvbbwFsx57etKXAJ4J2vrPnspfF</a></p>
<p>The end of the most recent month has seen a remarkable change in the distribution of token supply in the past 21 months. At the end of April 2019, whales only owned 53.16% of the STEEM token supply:</p>
<p><a href="https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmY7u7XJxnnwrqEc6QWg17vAWMCRs3fDYUnM3hw2c4baSV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmY7u7XJxnnwrqEc6QWg17vAWMCRs3fDYUnM3hw2c4baSV</a></p>
<p>That&#x2019;s substantial progress over the past couple of years. And it is most likely what EOS is trying to replicate by introducing a social media dapp. As Steemit has shown, there is no better way to distribute tokens fairly than by encouraging active participation via incentivization by token reward. All the other means we have encountered via blockchain - mining, transaction mining, staking, delegating, etc. - have all lead to more and more oligarchic systems.</p>
<p>If we want oligarchy, we might as well just stay in the fiat world, where the distribution of wealth in the United States is bleak and getting bleaker:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmT4jkvAKqhg4ADZswdaH4rspRQVmdWXM45fYvbSH6AMRu/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So I think it&#x2019;ll be a couple years before meOS can actually compete with STEEM in this all-important aspect of token supply distribution. It just takes time for a blockchain to be properly &#x201C;seasoned&#x201D; in this regard.</p>
<p>That being said, obviously the STEEM price is suffering due to the anticipation of the introduction of the &#x201C;Steem Killer.&#x201D; To me, this fear presents an interesting &#x201C;buy the rumor, sell the news&#x201D; opportunity. The &#x201C;rumor&#x201D; being STEEM will be killed and the &#x201C;news&#x201D; being it will actually take some time to build up a social media dapp with 45,000 DAUs and a somewhat fairly distributed token economy.</p>
<p>How many months of logging into meOS will the top trending post be &#x201C;Come gamble on EOSdice&#x201D; or &#x201C;Bring your friends to trade on Huobi&#x201D; or &#x201C;Stake your EOS with eos.fish&#x201D;? Or whatever&#x2026; It&#x2019;s gonna be spam city from all the big EOS whales for a while. And that will only worsen the Whale Problem, at least initially.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that @dan and B1 will figure something cool out in the long run. But it will definitely take time. That is just the nature of blockchain development. Rome wasn&#x2019;t built in a day and all that.</p>
<p>Even in a world with a robust meOS ecosystem, that certainly does not spell D-O-O-M for the STEEM blockchain at all. Social media is a space where many ecosystems can thrive simultaneously. Just look at Tumblr being <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/tumblr-is-neglected-by-marketers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Yahoo for $1.1 billion</a> back in 2013.</p>
<p>The point is, for Chrissakes, let us please have a few social media platforms in this world not owned by Facebook or Tencent!</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m still thinking about this issue and would love to hear any thoughts about #B1June, meOS, or the future of STEEM. If you have something to say, please comment below for STEEM rewards!!! &#x1F447;&#x1F447;&#x1F447;</p>
<p>As always, PEACE! &#x270C;&#x1F3FC;</p>

        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The story of how I got into finance is probably a lot different than most.</p>
<p>No, I did not have helicopter parents that pushed me into doing something lucrative. No, I did not have rich relatives that helped me by exposing me to their well-placed contacts. No, I wasn&#x2019;t a math whiz kid.</p>
<p>I mean I definitely attended some math competitions in my day. But calculus&#x2026; The struggle was real! There&#x2019;s only so many times you can fling a big, heavy textbook across the room before you start thinking, &#x201C;How much longer do I want to do THIS?&#x201D;</p>
<p>The story of how I got into finance is probably a lot more similar to the stories people from my generation like to tell when they give their reasons why they DON&#x2019;T like finance.</p>
<p>Despite our best efforts, it seems to me like we are all still living in the shadow of September 15, 2008. For those of you who forgot, were too young to care, or just plain don&#x2019;t want to remember, here&#x2019;s a little reminder:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmPgaGCkG6F6UfSbeYCRK16pECzmELD28C59csmSqUnvcH/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At that time, I had been running a small real estate investment operation. We hadn&#x2019;t been doing well. Obviously. I was trying to flip houses in the middle of the subprime mortgage crisis. What was I thinking?</p>
<p>Well, I certainly wasn&#x2019;t thinking the way a well-trained &#x201C;finance guy&#x201D; is supposed to think. In a classic misunderstanding of how to achieve an appropriate level of diversification in one&#x2019;s portfolio, in addition to my small real estate investment operation I had also invested in a few real estate investment trusts (REITs).</p>
<p>Why not? After all, I was an &#x201C;expert&#x201D; at this real estate stuff, right?</p>
<p>You should know how that story ended.</p>
<p>Not well.</p>
<p>At that point then and there, well not really at any particular point per se, but whenever the accumulation of financial loss caught up with the lizard part of my brain that just keeps on truckin&#x2019;&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;eating, drinking, and farting away&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;that lizard must have some thick skin because it seems like it took a while for things to get to that &#x201C;point&#x201D;&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;about as long maybe as I am taking to get to my point here&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;at whatever that point is then and there, I decided to seek out a world-class education in finance and investment theory.</p>
<p>I am still learning finance today because if there is one thing I have learned in 40 years it is that once a subject has chosen you&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;and really that&#x2019;s how it is, you don&#x2019;t choose it, it chooses you&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;it&#x2019;s a part of your everyday life forever. You have to live and breathe the stuff, remain humble and constantly seek out more knowledge.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s what I do.</p>
<p>So THAT&#x2019;s how I got into finance.</p>
<p>To find out what the hell went wrong back then in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Because to me it wasn&#x2019;t a &#x201C;panic,&#x201D; as former Fed chief Ben Bernanke once put it&#x2026;</p>
<p>It was a disaster!</p>
<p>All I know is that whatever THAT was back then, THAT was NOT RIGHT.</p>
<p>The academic pursuit of finance, and the wider finance industry itself, should be laser-focused on understanding, preventing, and safeguarding against the inevitable next economic crash. Bitcoin was born in the same fire. It is a potential solution to preventing a Great Recession that it is bound to be even worse than the first.</p>
<p>So if you are working in the finance industry, studying finance at university, trading shitcoins on your phone, or playing the leveraged ping-pong game on margin trading sites like BitMEX&#x2026; ask yourself:</p>
<p>Do you feel the same way about finance and cryptocurrency that I do?</p>
<p>Because if you&#x2019;re just trying to &#x201C;make a bunch of money&#x201D; and then retire when you&#x2019;re young, I&#x2019;m sure there are some other professions you could go into that would make that aspiration more attainable.</p>
<p>That way the rest of us can focus on building, creating, supporting, and educating our youth about the financial and technological innovations that will transform our global financial system into an inspiring, equitable, and sustainable one for generations to come.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve got to put my 2 sats in on an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/27/opinion/sunday/rich-social-inequality.amp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> I read the other day in the <em>New York Times</em>. It&#x2019;s called &#x201C;The Rich Kid Revolutionaries&#x201D; and it talks about the recent movement by the progeny of the affluent to rail against how the US &#x201C;is rigged in favor of making the very wealthy even wealthier.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Besides the very obvious Clintonian retort one could posit against this sentiment, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the economy, stupid!&#x201D; In a capitalist system, the business of business is business, and all that Milton Friedman jazz&#x2026; I just have to say&#x2026;</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s about time we had some rich kids take responsibility for the society of wealth &amp; privilege in America that our forebears created.</p>
<p>Now before I get flack for calling out poor unsuspecting trust fund kids, let me just say that I&#x2019;m not saying that hard work shouldn&#x2019;t be rewarded with the well-earned ability to take care of one&#x2019;s family (even for a couple or three generations).</p>
<p>We all aspire to that. It is the foundation of the Immigrant Dream that brought my grandfather to these shores back in the 1960s.</p>
<p>But while most of us are doomed to spend the bulk of our careers paying off student loans and maybe, if we&#x2019;re lucky, one measly mortgage&#x2026; It&#x2019;s nice to see that there are some rich kids, at organizations like <a href="https://resourcegeneration.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resource Generation</a> out there that realize what they&#x2019;ve got.</p>
<p>Not only that, they are trying to do something positive to close America&#x2019;s ever-widening rich-poor gap.</p>
<p>According to The World Bank, the US ranks third on the GINI Index, behind only notoriously corrupt Brazil &amp; Mexico. By all means, play with the data <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and please let me know what you find!</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s about time. The US recently passed China, whose rapidly ascendant middle class is quickly eroding what was one of the world&#x2019;s worst rich-poor gaps.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://steemit.com/life/@shanghaipreneur/casesin-success-1-jeff-bezos-of-amazon-amzn-1544677232307" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Bezos</a> of Amazon makes more in a minute than the median American worker makes in a year&#x2026;</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s high time we as a nation started putting this issue on the front burner.</p>
<p>What do you think we can do about class inequality and wealth redistribution? Is crypto part of the solution or part of the problem?</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments below. &#x1F447;&#x1F447;</p>

            <p>With Chinese Labor Day coming up on this Wednesday, May 1, 2019, I thought I&#x2019;d share one of my favorite stories to tell Chinese students.</p>
<p>The conversation usually begins with a question: &#x201C;You know about <em>Wu Yi</em>?&#x201D; <em>Wu Yi</em> literally means 5-1, the internationally recognized date for Labor Day, or as some countries call it:</p>
<h2 id="International-Worker&#x2019;s-Day"><a href="#International-Worker&#x2019;s-Day" class="headerlink" title="International Worker&#x2019;s Day."></a>International Worker&#x2019;s Day.</h2><p>##<br><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmTeB5ecqC1rpzeZbZAYzwAh3Lqr91ZN9MPRn7YZRRZGjG/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>My response usually elicits wide eyes and a short intake of breath. &#x201C;Why wouldn&#x2019;t I know about Wu Yi? It is the only Chinese holiday that was invented by Americans.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Whaaaat? You are <em>waiguoren</em>. You don&#x2019;t know about China. When I was a kid, Wu Yi was a Golden Week just like the National Day Holiday or Spring Festival. It is an important <em>Chineeese</em> holiday. There is no way it can be from America!&#x201D;</p>
<p>I smile, say something about Mao Zedong being the intellectual descendent of the American socialist progressive movement, and launch into a paraphrased version of the Chicago Haymarket affair.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYETvwHxuNPRoqBy7Wfz9wjs9eektwvKUYrNxP1vk5DxE/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The drawings that came from this incident are fantastic, I mean take a look at this one from the <a href="https://www.chicagohistory.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago Historical Society</a>. It is <em>Game of Thrones&#x2019;</em> &#x201C;Battle of Winterfell&#x201D;-worthy.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmTJLABN6H8ZLJYXcnJi2NdBk3RoqWM5cQJtD7D5zYQNW9/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Since I cannot tell the story much better than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>, here you go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Haymarket affair (also known as the Haymarket massacre or Haymarket riot) was the aftermath of a bombing that took place at a labor demonstration on Tuesday May 4, 1886, at Haymarket Square in Chicago. It began as a peaceful rally in support of workers striking for an eight-hour day and in reaction to the killing of several workers the previous day by the police. An unknown person threw a dynamite bomb at police as they acted to disperse the public meeting. The bomb blast and ensuing gunfire resulted in the deaths of seven police officers and at least four civilians; scores of others were wounded.</p>
<p>In the internationally publicized legal proceedings that followed, eight anarchists were convicted of conspiracy. The evidence was that one of the defendants may have built the bomb, but none of those on trial had thrown it. Seven were sentenced to death and one to a term of 15 years in prison. The death sentences of two of the defendants were commuted by Illinois governor Richard J. Oglesby to terms of life in prison, and another committed suicide in jail rather than face the gallows. The other four were hanged on November 11, 1887. In 1893, Illinois&#x2019; new governor John Peter Altgeld pardoned the remaining defendants and criticized the trial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why May 1 then?</p>
<p>In 1884, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions had held a convention setting May 1, 1886 as the day that the 8-hour workday would become a national standard. When that desire did not come to pass in a timely manner, strikes were staged throughout the country.</p>
<p>Chicago was at the epicenter.</p>
<h2 id="&#x201C;Eight-hour-day-No-cut-in-pay-&#x201D;"><a href="#&#x201C;Eight-hour-day-No-cut-in-pay-&#x201D;" class="headerlink" title="&#x201C;Eight-hour day! No cut in pay!&#x201D;"></a>&#x201C;Eight-hour day! No cut in pay!&#x201D;</h2><h2 id="&#x201C;Eight-hour-day-No-cut-in-pay-&#x201D;-1"><a href="#&#x201C;Eight-hour-day-No-cut-in-pay-&#x201D;-1" class="headerlink" title="&#x201C;Eight-hour day! No cut in pay!&#x201D;"></a>&#x201C;Eight-hour day! No cut in pay!&#x201D;</h2><p>##<br>The strikes lasted for days and culminated in the Haymarket massacre. Socialist parties throughout the world vowed to commemorate the brave workers who had been executed as a result of the riot. In 1889, May 1 officially became Labor Day throughout the world.</p>
<p>And it still is today. But not in America. In China.</p>
<p>Hence, during this upcoming 4-day &#x201C;weekend&#x201D; in Shanghai, let us not forget to remember fondly those unswerving Americans who fought so gallantly to give us this great Chinese holiday.</p>
<p>Thanks guys!</p>
