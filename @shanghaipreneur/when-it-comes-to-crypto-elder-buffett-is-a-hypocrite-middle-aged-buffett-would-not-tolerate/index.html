        <div class="content">
            <p>Please excuse the clickbait title, but I didn&#x2019;t know how else to get you Steemians to read about some old crazy trading stamp booklets your great-grandma used to spend hours managing while your great-grandpa fell asleep in his favorite chair after dinner. But that&#x2019;s what this article is about - the virtual currency that history has almost forgotten.</p>
<p>Recently, at the Woodstock of Capitalism, Warren Buffett and his elder sidekick Charles Munger gathered to dish dirt, talk investing, and dispense folksy aphorisms at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.</p>
<p>The Statler-and-Wardorf-type couple&#x2019;s comments about cryptocurrency were one of the most referenced quotes, at least in my little circle of cryptoficionados, during the <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/meet01/2018Meetinginfo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three day orgy</a> of discounted shopping, investor presentations, interviews, a 5K, and most importantly STEAK!!!</p>
<p>Qz reported the gist of the matter in a piece they published on <a href="https://qz.com/1271029/warren-buffett-hates-bitcoin-charlie-munger-compares-crypto-to-turds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 5</a>. Buffett warned, &#x201C;Cryptocurrencies will come to bad endings,&#x201D; while Munger claimed, &#x201C;To me, it&#x2019;s just dementia. It&#x2019;s like somebody else is trading turds and you decide you can&#x2019;t be left out.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVQf5oGz1YuFqSLg4mc4Axp9qLXkRFaVXULSmbW6uf6kr/buffet_munger_statler_wardorf&apos;.jpg" alt="buffet_munger_statler_wardorf&apos;.jpg"></p>
<p>But come on, one guy is 87 and the other is 94! You can&#x2019;t expect them to understand crypto. Besides, these are the guys that missed Apple even as late as 2011 when they plowed over $10 billion into IBM as a supposedly superior alternative. Had they invested in The Big Fruit back when its founder Steve Jobs died, which many people at the time recognized was a very big and very juicy buying opportunity, they would have nearly quadrupled their money!</p>
<p>As it stands, Berkshire exited IBM at a loss (Hey! You can&#x2019;t win &#x2018;em all). And they have a $45 billion-plus stake in the iPhone maker any way. To long-time followers of Buffett like myself, it must seem like we are getting close to Senile Buffett stage. It&#x2019;s really Bizarro Land to see Berkshire have any tech stock, much less make it the single biggest investment position in the entire world for a non-fund. When I was a kid, the Buffett I knew didn&#x2019;t invest in tech stocks because &#x201C;there is no margin of safety&#x201D; and he &#x201C;just doesn&#x2019;t understand&#x201D; them.</p>
<p>Well, things change it seems.</p>
<p>And Buffett&#x2019;s stance towards crypto will change, too. It&#x2019;s my belief that if he had enough time remaining in his life, he&#x2019;d come around to liking cryptocurrencies eventually as well. It may be some future as-yet-undreamed-of coin or, heck, it could even be Ethereum a few years from now! After all, this week also saw reports <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/montymunford/2018/05/18/apples-steve-wozniak-dumps-facebook-and-thinks-ethereum-could-be-the-new-apple/2/#14c906be6314" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Forbes nonetheless</a> claiming that the tech wunderkind behind Apple himself, Steve Wozniak, &#x201C;was extremely upbeat about Ethereum and described it as a platform that was just like Apple&#x2019;s and could become as influential as his company became.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Why is it an inevitable conclusion that, if given the time, Buffett would eventually embrace crypto? Well, first of all, he sure did come around on Apple in the end, didn&#x2019;t he? And second of all, well, that will require me to tell a story. So sit back and let me regale you with the tale of <strong>Blue Chip Stamps</strong>. </p>
<p>Buffett biographer Alice Schroeder discusses the importance of one investment in particular that changed the trajectory of Buffett&#x2019;s investment career. It was one of the few prescient buys that cemented the most important partnership of his life, bringing him the human version of Waldorf to his own Statler.</p>
<p>From Schroeder&#x2019;s excellent work <em>The Snowball</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He and Munger had also discovered another company they saw as promising and were buying as much stock of it as they could. This was Blue Chip Stamps, a trading-stamp company. They would buy it separately and together, and over the course of time Blue Chip would dramatically reshape the course of both men&#x2019;s careers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To describe what Blue Chip was as a company, you must travel back to a post-war time when mothers and grandmothers paid for groceries with cash and often had a few choices for their daily shopping available to them within walking distance of their home. As part of the change from their transaction and as a way to encourage repeat business, they would receive a fistful of stamps, stamps that were essentially a marketing giveaway, an early version of today&#x2019;s retail loyalty rewards programs. Customers eventually accumulated enough stamps to paste into little booklets and claim the modest reward of a blender, a television, a radio, a fishing rod, a tetherball set, etc. The most popular item to acquire with trading stamps was a toaster.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbH7HUY1mEAuQtH4WBEnmW5BhtAHgT4gksA31hunhmiDp/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These trading stamps were a fun free way to get cool stuff without influencing the rest of the household budget. Postwar consumers hoarded their stamps and collected books full of them and waited for when they could exchange those books for exotic items they would otherwise be unable to afford.</p>
<p>By the 1960s, there were so many trading stamp companies vying for customers that the competition drove them to accept just about anything as long as it was equal to the cash value of the collected stamps, which was something like $1.60 per 1,000 stamps. Crazy acquisitions in history via trading stamp include a Cessna airplane, a pair of gorillas (5.4 million S&amp;H Green Stamps), a donkey for an overseas church missionary, an elephant, and a variety of special equipment vehicles like school buses, ambulances, and fire trucks. </p>
<p>By 1964, industry leader Sperry &amp; Hutchinson alone printed three times as many stamps per year as the U.S. Post Office. When we reached &#x201C;peak trading stamp bubble&#x201D; (so to speak) in 1969, more than 80% of U.S. households collected them. The S&amp;H redemption catalog had a higher circulation than the Sears Roebuck, which for all you millennials out there is literally the company that defined what it meant to print a catalog.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdcsmaZFNT8uPXgurUDpaMT4Eu6ri94N2RmpoUPpxs75H/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These loyalty stamps were the byproduct of a rapidly vanishing era of thriftiness. Never waste. Never want. Never go into debt. But what Buffett and Munger liked so much about Blue Chip was not the aura of their youth, but rather the monopoly on stamp production that Blue Chip enjoyed with its vast array of retail partners. This partnership served also to limit the supply of Blue Chip tokens, er, um, stamps. The result was a unique kind of virtual currency that had no intrinsic value beyond what people ascribed to them. And oh did people assign value to them! Not only were the exotic items mentioned previously acquired solely with trading stamps but, in their time, they were literally everywhere.</p>
<p>Schroeder again quotes in her book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you had all the major oil companies and grocers giving out a single stamp, it became like money. People would leave their change behind and take the stamps. Morticians gave out stamps. Prostitutes gave them&#x2026; It was ubiquitous. Everybody had them. People even counterfeited them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait! How did such a sought after asset get unfairly maligned by the market? If everyone had these stamps, why would a bunch of value investors be able to cheaply buy them up hand over fist? The answer to that, my friends, is simple. And is also eerily reminiscent of the current crypto kerfuffle.</p>
<p><strong>Regulation</strong>. Stock in Blue Chip Stamps was so cheap because of the specter of regulation. (Sound familiar?). The Department of Justice had the company in their sights, eventually forcing it to sell a part of itself to the grocery chains that it had as its original customers. The industry original S&amp;H had served an antitrust suit against Blue Chip as well. There was a long line of potential lawsuits in the pipeline, too. But when some of these concerns came to the fore for a bit and shares dropped from a high of $25 to $13 a share, Buffett just kept right on buying, using whatever investment vehicle he had available to him at the time that had ready cash.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s hard to tell exactly how much money Buffett and Munger made off Blue Chip Stamps - primarily because they used its dwindling cash flows to buy superb companies like See&#x2019;s Candies and Wesco Financial, companies which are vital parts of their shared empire today.</p>
<p>But rest assured, in today&#x2019;s dollars, their profit would easily be measured <strong>IN THE BILLIONS</strong>.</p>
<p>So let&#x2019;s review, so the next time you hear about Warren Buffett hating on crypto, you too can recount the story of Blue Chip Stamps. Buffett and his most trusted investment partners sunk close to $100 million, which was at the time surely a princely sum, to buy a virtual currency of limited supply with no intrinsic value that was about to run the gauntlet against a whole host of regulators&#x2026;</p>
<p>And when they were in their 40s, they looked at this situation, not unlike the current cryptoasset markets at all, and decided upon one simple course of action:</p>
