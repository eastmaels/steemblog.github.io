<p>Recently @paulag has published an article about the statistics related to @ned&#x2019;s SP delegation and I am going to respond to it. </p>
<p>Being a (temporary) whale was not that easy, at least not as easy as you think. You will never know what it&#x2019;s like unless you reach there. Once I received the delegation, I was bombarded with messages on Steemit.chat and also Discord, and there were a lot of things to handle every single day, and many factors need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>There were two things mentioned in her article, selling votes and delegation. I don&#x2019;t regard it as selling. The reason that I did that is because I wanted to support the new African and Indonesian Steemians there, and I think we, the Chinese people were already given a lot of SP at that time so I wanted to share some of the benefits with the people from other countries, which are also growing in numbers. That&#x2019;s also the reasons that I organised two Anime Drawing Challenges to let other talented people from other countries benefit. And also every day I was bombarded with tons of messages and post links and it really did annoy me, which was suffocating. I checked my wallet every day so it was no surprise that I would click into the memos and some posts did show great effort and content, some of them were even curated by @curie. For example, a local meet-up or use SBDs to buy a cup of coffee in the local community. </p>
<p>Well, you must be questioning my motives. Okay, <strong>LET&#x2019;S DO THE MATHS</strong>. The amount of SBDs I received each day was generally less than $3. Do you really think that I would care about this tiny little amount of SBDs while I was holding over 500k SP in my hands at that time, WHICH WAS NOT EVEN ENOUGH FOR BUYING A F**KING HAMBURGER? Are you kidding me? Ask yourself, was it really worth doing it if you were me? In which way was it cost-effective for me? Couldn&#x2019;t I earn this $3 by other means? And I still needed to spend a lot of time to click the link, do a quick read and upvoted them one by one when Steemit was having lagging and instability issues, and just for less than $3 a day? How does it make any sense to you? </p>
<p>I am sure you, who are reading this post, is not a dumb person and you can make up your mind whether it&#x2019;s the case.</p>
<p>If I needed to use the delegated SP to earn some extra money for myself, I wouldn&#x2019;t do it in this way that everyone can simply check my wallet and see. I CAN EASILY THINK OF OTHER WAYS TO DO THAT. Why didn&#x2019;t I just upvote my own comments and create another account and upvote it, couldn&#x2019;t I earn more and much harder to be noticed? Or are you insulting my intelligence that I don&#x2019;t even know every transaction and activity is clearly written on the STEEM blockchain, letting you to trace after joining Steemit for five months? I didn&#x2019;t hide any of my data and the data can be easily found on the STEEM blockchain. </p>
<p>In fact, many Steemians from other countries did not send any money to me and I still upvoted their posts because I have enjoyed their content, especially for those who attended my Anime Drawing Challenge, I gave a much much higher voting weight than those who have sent me the money.</p>
<p>Well, if you really think that this still isn&#x2019;t appropriate. I can generate roughly $15 with MY OWN STEEM POWER every day. So clearly it is enough to upvote all the posts. Can&#x2019;t I upvote any posts that I like? And clearly what do I do with my own SP is NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.</p>
<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmbTSrsRdXikKr2h7LcKurb5GSyHrqzbBrj94oRNYVGsL6/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-28%20at%204.46.46%20pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-10-28 at 4.46.46 pm.png"></p>
<p>And yes, I did delegate SP to @justyy and this was an act to support his project, which was generally something like a Chinese version of a mix of minnowbooster and minnowsupportproject to help the newbies in the cn community and you can see that a lot of Chinese people are delegating their power to support his project, and there are 42 people delegating power to him in total when I checked. And again, that&#x2019;s my OWN Steem Power, what&#x2019;s the problem at all? </p>
<p>I can tell you that I have spent a lot of time here, in both writing and curating, and they were all done manually without the aid of robots, and I am sure the statistics can prove it. When it comes to curation, every one has his own preference and standards, and I am not sure that I can do very well but I have already tried my best to reach out to as many posts as possible.</p>

The answer is no</a> to look for more statistics. When you want to truly understand what was going on, I am sure you need to make sure that you are not only listen to the opinions from one side.</p>
<p>Data is data, and it certainly reflects the reality, but can it really tell the whole picture? Especially when you are on outsider looking at the Chinese and Hong Kong community. </p>

<p>By the way, it&#x2019;s nice to see @surpassinggoogle was doing really good and I have to say that I am impressed and happy to see him keeping his delegation, contributing more to the whole Steemit community in the future. To show my little support, I have voted @steemgigs for witness.</p>
<p>At last, once again thank you @ned for the power delegation and it certainly brought more new Chinese and Hong Kong users in, he has already helped a lot and I am totally grateful for that, I am not an influential person with a large amount of Steem Power </p>
